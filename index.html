COURSE DISCLAIMER:  
The information contained in this course, was prepared by Dr. Paul R. Sherman and is 
being sponsored by the postgraduate department of the University of Bridgeport School  
of Chiropractic and does not constitute legal advice regarding interpreting plain fil m x-
rays. The information in this course represents some of the more common radiographic 
findings and disorders typically encountered in a chiropractic office. The radiographic 
findings and disorders in this course does not constitute an all -inclusive list and is not 
intended to replace any independent radiographic interpretation from a Diplomate of the 
American Chiropractic Board of Radiology ( DACBR) and/or medical radiologist. It is 
meant to assist the chiropractic physician in systematically interpreting  plain film x -rays 
of the spine and pelvis. It should be noted that prior to administering any treatment a 
complete case history, past medical history, family history and physical examination 
should be performed. In addition, if medically indicated additional radiographic and/or 
 
 
other diagnostic studies should be performed on all patients to determine if chiropractic 
care and/or adjunct therapies would be appropriate. If indicated, referral to a radiologist 
and/or other healthcare provider for consultation/evaluation should be considered.  
 
THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN INTREPRETING PLAIN FILM X- RAYS:  
Depending on the doctor, there are many different ways to evaluate and interpret plain 
film x -rays of the spine. Of utmost importance is that the doctor use some kind 
of  systematic approach when evaluating all aspects of the film. Here are some key 
factors to keep in mind:  
• Always have access to the appropriate clinical information, i.e.: case history, 
past medical history, family history, physical examination findings , age and 
gender of patient.  
• Identify the x- ray views taken, always have opposing views available, have 
prior films for comparison, and be certain films are of high quality.  
• Do a quick scan first and give your initial impression (normal or abnormal). If 
abnormal, does it appear to be congenital (something the patient was born 
with) or acquired (something that the patient developed over time)?  
• Always assess for osteoporosis (a condition that affects calcium in the bones 
resulting in loss of bone density and thinning of the cortex). Risk factors 
include: 
o   being female  
o   over the age of 50  
o   family history of osteoporosis  
o   physically inactive  
o   smoking 
o   taking corticosteroids  
o   low intake of calcium and vitamin D  
o   hormonal changes (menopause  or hysterectomy)  
o   chronic diseases such as kidney, lung, stomach and intestines  
Symptomatology varies depending upon loss of bone mass and complicating factors 
like osseous fractures.   There are three general types of osteoporosis:  
A. Generalized osteoporosis- widespread loss of bone mass involving the spine, 
pelvis and/or proximal long bones. (Might be post -menopausal or senile.)  
B. Regional osteoporosis -bone mass loss is restricted to a specific region or segment 
of the body (like part o f or an entire extremity).  
C. Localized osteoporosis -loss of bone mass limited to a small area (may be from an 
inflammatory arthritis, neoplasm or infection).  
 
 
Note:  Laboratory findings such as calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase are 
usually normal pr ovided there are no recent fractures. More accurate testing would 
include measuring specific biochemical markers (serum or urinary)  to assess osetoblastic 
and osteoclastic activity. These markers include bone formation markers (bone specific 
alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and procollagen extension peptides) and bone 
resorption markers (urinary pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline total and dialyzable 
hydroxyproline). . In addition, diagnostic testing can be utilized to assist in determining 
bone density levels and possible risks factors for developing osteoporosis and/or 
complications associated with osteoporosis i.e.; dual -energy x- ray absorptiometry 
(DXA). Keep in mind that DXA is not a 100% reliable test. There are many statistical 
factors involved in figuring out bone mineral density (BMD).  
• Identify and evaluate alignment and all bony structures, areas of cartilage 
(joint spaces), and soft tissue structures.  
• When done reviewing the films, stop and come back a few hours later to 
review the films again. This acts as a safety feature to double check yourself.  
• Always indicate radiographic findings (and diagnosis, if known) in the medical 
record.  
• Refer out for additional diagnostic studies and/or laboratory tests if clinically 
and medically necessary in order to further evaluate and make a proper 
diagnosis. 
• Always keep in mind the five radiographic densities —air, fat, water, bone, 
metal.  
• As obvious as it sounds, you must know what normal anatomy is in order to be 
able to detect abnormal anatomy. Remember, you are responsible for whatever 
findings are on the films.  
IMPORTANT MEDICAL/LEGAL ISSUES REGARDING PLAIN FILMS:  
In order to be able to recognize and interpret plain film x- rays of the spine, the 
chiropractic physician must have a clear understanding of norma l anatomy, normal 
radiographic variants, pathology and differential diagnosis in order to be able to detect 
abnormalities. While many of these skills were acquired during chiropractic education, 
clinical experiences and additional postgraduate training can further enhance them. Many 
medical mistakes stem from interpretations performed on poor quality films, relying 
solely on x- ray reports without reviewing the actual films, refusing to obtain second 
opinions when clinically appropriate, failing to refer a patient for additional diagnostic 
studies, neglecting to obtain and review previous diagnostic tests, or not performing a 
complete case history, past medical history or physical examination.  
It is critical to perform this type of systematic approach when interpreting plain film x -
rays. This approach is necessary to reduce the doctor's chances of misinterpreting the 
films and the risk of a medical malpractice action.  
 
 
 
 
IMPORTANCE OF A RADIOGRAPHIC REPORT IN THE PATIENT'S FILE:  
• Provides a means of documenting x- ray findings  
• Provides use for comparison purposes for previous or future studies  
• Provides a record of the radiographic findings if the films are lost or not 
available 
• Assists with communication with other healthcare practitioners and third party 
payers  
• Provides critical information which may alter treatment management 
• Provides information that may assist with future testing  
• Assists with patient communication  
• Medical legal reasons  
KEY COMPONENTS OF THE RADIOGRAPHIC REPORT:  
 
The radiographic report should include the following:  
• Author identification —At the top of the page, the doctor and/or practice name, 
address and phone number should be identified. This allows the medical record 
to meet the NCQA guidelines regarding appropriate  medical record keeping. 
To obtain full details of the NCQA guidelines, it is recommended that you 
login to chirocredit.com to take the course "Documentation 101."  
• Brief information regarding the patient —Name, date of birth (DOB), age, sex, 
C/C (chief comp laint) and x- ray study performed and views taken.  
• X-ray findings/Radiographic findings —The "ABC's" 
(Alignment,  Bone, Cartilage and S oft Tissue) (Please refer to specific sections 
in this course regarding a systematic approach to interpreting plain films of  the 
cervical, thoracic, lumbar, lumbosacral spine and pelvis.)  
• Conclusions/Impression—This factual section would include the most 
significant radiographic findings and diagnosis. In this section, appropriate 
medical/radiographic terminology should be util ized.  
• Recommendations—This section is used specifically to address any significant 
radiographic findings that may be of clinical concern and warrant further 
evaluation and/or follow -up testing.  
• Signature of doctor who interpreted films  
Note: As with all me dical documentation, the report should be dated.

COMMON RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES USED IN A CHIROPRACTIC 
PRACTICE:  
Diagnostic procedures should only be considered after a complete medical history and 
 
 
physical examination is performed and the physician determines that the diagnostic 
testing would be medically necessary.  
 
1. Plain film x -rays  are the most widely utilized skeletal imaging method. Plain film x -
rays are primarily used to rule out fractures , dislocations, anomalies or bone 
pathology.  They are also used in biomechanical analysis. The doctor should take into 
account  some  of the following guidelines for performing skeletal radiographs.  
 
Probable Indicators:  
• Trauma- both recent and hold  
• Assessme nt of joint instability  
• Unexplained weight loss  
• Night pain  
• Neuromotor deficit  
• Inflammatory arthritis  
• History of malignancy 
• Fever of unknown origin greater than 100°F  
• Abnormal blood finding  
• Deformity i.e.: scoliosis  
• Failure to respond to therapy 
• Medical legal implications  
Possible Indicators:  
• Greater than 50 years old  
• Drug or alcohol abuse  
• Corticosteroid use  
• Unavailability of alternate imaging  
• Unavailable, lost, outdated or non- diagnostic previous x- ray studies  
• Research  
• Systemic disease  
Non-Indica tors:  
• Patient education  
• Routine Screening 
• Habit  
 
 
• Discharge status assessment  
• Routine biomechanical analysis  
• Pre-employment 
• Physical limitations of patient  
• Financial gain  
• Patient recently exposed to high levels of radiation exposure  
• Pregnancy  
 
2. Digital Radiography - Indications for use are the same as for plain film x -rays 
(discussed in the first part of this cours e). Digital radiography is a diagnostic tool used to 
obtain osseous images without using intensifying screens and film. A digital plate is 
mounted in a cassette, which  holds a digital card. An x- ray exposure is still taken, but 
because a digital card is bei ng used, it requires less radiation exposure to produce an 
image than a traditional plain film x -ray would. The image is recorded on the digital card, 
which is then put through a reader. The reader converts the data into an image a t a 
computer workstation.   The digital image can be labeled and saved as the base image. 
With the computer, a base image can be modified in size, color, contrast, or it can be 
copied onto paper, email, or transferred to a CD.  
This technology has many benefits some of which are as follows: 
• Increase patient safety  
• Decrease patient exposure  
• Enhance film interpretation  
• Reduce the need for storage of film  
• Eliminate the need for a darkroom and all of its components and supplies  
To a small practitioner, this technology may not be cost eff ective. Since it may be too 
difficult financially for the small practitioner to have this type of technology in a private 
office, it is more commonly found in large radiology facilities, hospitals and teaching 
universities.  
 
3. Tomography  - Used to obtain specific images of anatomy and its abnormalities that 
are not accessible by plain film x -rays. It also enables the physician to obtain specific 
images of selected levels in the body by blurring out all structures above and below the 
selected level in quest ion. 
 
4. Radionuclide Imaging (Bone Scan)  - Detects skeletal metastasis, tumors, infections, 
arthritis, fractures (occult, stress and recent fractures), and avascular necrosis. Done by 
injecting a radioisotope intravenously and waiting to record areas of i ncrease uptake (hot 
spots). Brain, heart, lung, and kidneys can also be evaluated.  
 
 
5. SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography)  - A combination of 
tomography and bone scan. Evaluates areas within bone or areas where bones overlap 
i.e.: pars interarticularis.  
 
6. Myelography - Used to diagnose disc, vertebral canal (stenosis), spinal cord and nerve 
root disease. Done by injecting a water -soluble contrast media into the subarachnoid 
space.  
 
7. Discography - Evaluates disc pathology i.e.: degeneration, disc architecture, pain 
response and disc resistance to injection. Done by injecting a water -soluble contrast 
media into the disc under fluoroscopic control.  
 
8. Ultrasound -Primarily used to diagnose abdominal, pelvic and vascular disease i.e.: 
soft tiss ue masses (cystic or solid).  
 
9. Computed Tomography (CT -Scan)  - Evaluates the CNS. When evaluating the 
skeleton, it aids in detecting neoplasms, trauma, infections, metabolic disease and spinal 
syndromes. 
 
10.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  - Evaluates s oft tissues i.e.: discs 
(degeneration, bulges, herniations), ligaments (tears), muscle, spinal cord (tumors), nerve 
roots as well as bone marrow, joints, spinal canal and/or lateral recess, intracranial 
disease and CNS disorders i.e.: multiple sclerosis. I n addition, intravenous contrast 
(gadolinium) will enhance areas of increased vascularity i.e.: neoplasm, inflammation 
and scar tissue.  
Note:  When assessing for an active and/or inactive spondylolysis and/or 
spondylolisthesis the MRI scan should be performed using STIR (short -t-inversion 
recovery) sequences.   This will detect fat suppression thereby, evaluating the 
physiological activity in the area of the pars interarticularis.     
 
Note:  It is estimated that 20 -30% of patients without a history of pain have a positive 
finding on MRI revealing disc involvement. The doctor of chiropractic must keep these 
statistics in mind when assessing patients with positive findings on their MRI. In 
addition, disc disorders should always be correlated with the patient's cl inical picture 
(symptoms, history and examination findings). If this is not done the value of the MRI 
findings will decrease significantly. One should remember the annular fibers of the disc 
are pain sensitive and if torn, they can cause spinal pain and/or  leg pain. This pain can be 
caused from mechanical compression of the nerve root or from secondary inflammatory 
changes from nuclear extrusion. Whatever the cause, it should be determined so the 
patient can receive the most appropriate care. The chiropract ic physician should keep in 
mind the following terminology used to describe disc disorders, especially when 
reviewing the results of an MRI report.  
 
 
 
 
Three major categories of disc disorders:  
 
1. Bulging disc  is when the outer portion of the disc (the annular fibrous) becomes 
distorted and extends beyond the edges of the bony vertebral body.   
Note:  Bulging discs are usually the result of the natural aging process and 
commonly seen with disc degeneration.  
2. Herniation  is when there are radial tears of the annulus fibrosis that extend near or 
through the outer portion of the annular fibers.   Thus causing migration of the nucleus 
pulposus to move towards the tears and go beyond the limits of the normal disc space. 
Disc herniations have been further catego rized as protrusion and extrusion.   
a. Protrusion -focal area of the nucleus pulposus, which goes beyond the vertebral 
margins, but remains beneath the outer annular fibers and posterior longitudinal 
ligament (PLL).   In addition, the base of the lesion at its origin is boarder than the 
disc material beyond the disc space.  
b. Extrusion- focal area of nucleus pulposus that extends through the annular 
fibrous into the epidural space. In addition, the disc material beyond the disc space 
is boarder than base of the lesion.  
3.   Sequestration -is when extruded disc material has lost continuity with its disc of 
origin (a free fragment).   The free fragment can migrate away from its parent disc 
(caudad or cephalic).   It can also float in the canal and possibly become lodged at another 
spinal level.    
Note:  Special attention should be given when treating patients with disc disorders. Disc 
disorders might mimic a spinal cord tumor, especially if the problem has been 
progressing slowly. The doctor of chiropractic must exami ne the "disc patient" regularly 
for signs of progressive neurological deficits, which may indicate surgical necessity.  
In addition, disc disorders can potentially cause a cauda equina syndrome, which is a 
compression and/or compromise of the cauda equina. Patient presentation usually 
consists of complaints of saddle anesthesia, and/or recent bladder or bowel dysfunction 
(i.e.: urinary retention, increase frequency or overflow, incontinence, rectal or genital 
sensory changes, severe or progressive neurologic  deficits in the lower extremities and 
muscle weakness of the lower extremities and/or foot drop.) If a patient presents with any 
of these complaints or develops any of them following spinal manipulation, immediate 
referral for a neurosurgical consult should be given. The chiropractic physician should 
keep in mind that the cost of treating patients with disc herniations surgically is very high 
especially when combined with surgical costs, medications, MRI, rehab and disability. 
Cervical laminectomy could cost  $60,000 and fusion could increase the costs to 
$112,000. Lumbar laminectomy could cost  $83,000 and fusion could increase the costs to 
$169,000. Certainly, patients with disc disorders that are not classified as surgical 
emergencies can benefit from conservative chiropractic care with significantly lower 
costs and positive clinical outcomes.

X-RAY SCAN CERVICAL SPINE  
During parts three through ten of this course, it is important that the doctor keep in mind 
all the key factors previously discussed in part one under the heading "Things To 
Consider When Interpreting Plain Film X -Rays."  
 
X-RAY SCAN NEUTRAL LATERAL CERVICAL (NLC):  
Give it your first impression —normal/abnormal, congenital (something the patient is 
born with)/acquired (something the patient developed over time either short term or long 
term).  
  
Assess the ADI ( altantodental interspace). This is the space between the anterior aspect of 
the odontoid process and the posterior aspect of the anterior tubercle. This space should 
 
 
be no greater than 3mm in an adult and 5mm in a child. If the measurement is greater, 
consider the following possible causes:  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or any other inflammatory arthritide like AS, Psoriatic, 
Reiter's etc.  
  
Trauma to the transverse ligament (tear)  
  
Possible infection  
  
Agenesis of dens (If you suspect agenesis of the dens look at the anterior tubercle to see 
if there is hypertrophy of the anterior tubercle, which is usually seen with agenesis of 
dens or possible Os Odontiodium (failure of fusion of a secondary center of ossification 
at the base of the odontoid process).  
  
Down 's syndrome (Trisomy 21). 20% of patients with Down's syndrome have agenesis of 
the transverse ligament.  
Note:  Special Olympics require that the participants have a NLC performed to rule out 
the possibility of anterior translation of the atlas C1.  
 
Special Note:  Altantoaxial instability is commonly seen in Rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and is seen in up to 35% of the cases of RA when cervical 
involvement is present. RA is considered a connective tissue disease, cause 
unknown, that affects pat ients between 20- 60 years old,  more commonly 
females. If the onset is before the age of 16, it is referred to as  juvenile RA . RA 
classically affects the hands and feet causing soft tissue swelling which is 
commonly seen at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, known a s 
Haygarth's nodes. In up to 80% of the patients, it is the cervical spine that 
seems to be affected if and when the spine becomes involved as the disease 
progresses. Radiographically, RA is usually bilateral, symmetrical with 
juxtaarticular osteoporosis, uniform loss of joint spaces, marginal erosions, 
large pseudocysts, deformity and periarticular soft tissue swelling. Synovium 
usually becomes hypertrophied forming granulation tissue (pannus formation), 
which affects cartilage surfaces. Pannus formation u sually involves the bones 
causing erosion and cartilage destruction. Patients with RA who have cervical 
spine involvement many times also develop an increase in the ADI 
(altantodental interspace) a result of the pannus formation causing C1 to 
translate for ward (anteriorly). Laboratory findings typically reveal an elevated 
ESR, a positive RA latex (which is seen in 70% of the cases) and anemia.  
 
Certainly, one should differentiate RA from other common inflammatory 
arthritides like Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) , Psoriatic and Reiter's arthritis. 
For example, AS typically affects younger males 15 -35 years old, bilateral 
symmetrical fusion is common in the joints starting at the sacroiliac joints and 
ascending up the spine to the thoracolumbar spine, costal articulations and 
 
 
cervical spine. ADI may be affected. Laboratory findings reveal HLA -B27 
positive 90% of the time, ESR is increased in the active phase of the disease, 
RA factor is negative and CBC reveals mild anemia. Psoriatic arthritis affects 
males and females equally between the ages of 20 -50, skin lesions (psoriasis) 
is common. Radiographically, sacroiliac joints fuse bilaterally, but 
asymmetrical and DIP and PIP joints are affected. ADI may also be affected. 
Laboratory findings reveal negative ESR, negative RA latex and HLA -B27 
positive in 60% of the cases. On the other hand, Reiter's arthritis is caused by 
venereal disease (sexual exposure) and/or enteric (dysentery) onset and affects 
males between the ages of 18 -40 years old. . Patients may develop uveit is, 
urethritis and polyarthritis, a triad commonly seen with Reiter's arthritis. 
Radiographically, arthritis develops and affects the lower extremities, 
thoracolumbar spine and sacroiliac joint (usually unilateral fusion). ADI may 
also be involved. Laboratory findings reveal an increase ESR, negative RA 
latex and a positive HLA -B27 in 75% of the cases  
  
Assess the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies where the anterior longitudinal ligament 
(ALL) lies looking for the following:  
A. Thin vertical calcification along the ALL (referred to as marginal 
syndesmophytes). This is associated with Ankylosing Spondylitis, 
(aka Marie Strumpell's disease) an inflammatory arthritis. Clinically 
it is typically seen in younger males 15- 35 years old at a ratio of 1 to 
4 black s to whites. These patients tend to complain of achiness and 
stiffness of varying degrees usually involving the axial skeleton. In 
the early stages of the disease, complete remission of symptoms is 
not uncommon. Chronic prostatitis is associated in 80% of male 
patients. They may also have a decrease in chest expansion. 
Depending upon the stage of the disease, radiographically the 
patient may have an increase in the ADI, decrease in the cervical 
lordosis and fusion of the posterior facets, and IVD. The disea se 
tends to start at the sacroiliac joints and ascend up the spine and skip 
to the thoracolumbar spine, costal articulations and cervical spine. If 
multiple levels are ankylosed with marginal syndesmophytes, it is 
referred to as  bamboo spine  or poker spine . Lab findings: HLA -B27 
is positive in 90% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis, ESR is 
increased in the active phase of the disease, CBC reveals mild 
anemia, and RA factor is negative.  
  
B. Large flowing spurs along the ALL referred to as hyperostosis. 
These findings are usually associated with DISH (diffuse idiopathic 
skeletal hyperostosis), (aka Forestiers disease or Ankylosing 
hyperostosis). Clinically it is typically seen in males over the age of 
50 and may cause dysphagia and adult onset diabetes mellitus. The 
symptomatology tends to vary because joint motion is usually 
unaffected. Radiographically, it does not affect the posterior facets 
 
 
or IVD (no fusion) and usually the disc spaces are maintained at 
three or more levels. Lab findings may demonstrate  increased 
glucose levels (32% of patients diagnosed with DISH may have 
adult onset of diabetes mellitus). The patient may also have a 
positive HLA - B8, which is seen in approximately 40% of patients 
with DISH.  
  
C. Lipping and spurring along the ALL —horizont al projections of 
bone coming off the anterior vertebral bodies and/or posterior 
vertebral bodies —referred to as spondylophytes, exostosis or 
osteophytes and are usually associated with DJD, (aka osteoarthritis, 
or wear and tear disease). Clinically it is typically more common in 
females, ages 50 and up but certainly can be younger. These patients 
tend to complain of pain and stiffness with crepitus during 
movements of the joints. In addition, they may complain or present 
with swelling of the joints. DJD is  the most common form of 
arthritis. Weightbearing joints are usually affected. Vacuum sign 
(aka vacuum phenomenon) is an important early sign of DJD. It 
represents nitrogen gas in the nuclear and annular fissures and is 
seen radiographically as a linear radiolucency in the disc space. 
Extension tends to be the best view to create a vacuum sign. 
Vacuum sign usually indicates degeneration of the disc and 
indicates that intersegmental motion is occurring. Vacuum sign is 
considered a reliable plain film x -ray f inding to exclude the 
possibility of infection. Disc infections do not show a vacuum sign 
because fluid from the infection tends to collect in the fissures. As 
for the hands, the DIP joints may develop Heberden's nodes, or PIP 
joints Bouchard's nodes.   This is different from RA, which affects 
the MCP joints causing Haygarths nodes. As a general rule with 
DJD, radiographically the joints are affected asymmetrically with 
nonuniform loss of joint space. Depending upon the stage of the 
arthritis, osteophytic fo rmation and subchondral sclerosis can be 
present as well as subchondral cysts and degenerative subluxations. 
Lab findings with DJD are usually normal. The following findings 
in the spine are typical of DJD.  
Lipping/spurring anterior and/or posterior vertebral body  
Decreased disc space or height  
Subchondral sclerosis at vertebral endplates Note: The most common cause of IVF 
encroachment is hypertrophy of the joints of Von Luschka (aka uncovertebral) joints.  
Assess the anterior vertebral bodies for compression and/or avulsion fractures many 
times caused from a hyperflexion/hyperextension type injury.  
  
 
 
Assess the dens and check the density of the dens, which should appear approximately 
twice as dense as C2 body. The reason for this is the lateral masses and de ns are thicker 
structures than C2 body and tend to appear more opaque or whiter than C2 body. Also, 
assess the height and alignment of the dens looking for any lucency at the base and/or tip.  
 
If there is any lucency at the base of the dens consider the fo llowing possibilities: 
Jagged line -Fracture at the base of the dens  
Smooth line (thick lucency) - Os Odontoidium (failure of fusion of a 
secondary center of ossification at the base of the dens)  
No dens - Agenesis of the dens)  
Malposition of C1 (mock defect)  superimposed structures giving 
you the appearance that there is a lucency, but really there is not.  
 
If there is any lucency at the tip of the dens consider the following 
possibilities:  
Jagged line - Fracture at the tip of the dens  
Smooth line - Os Terminale (failure of fusion of a secondary center 
of ossification at the tip of the dens)  
 
Assess the vertebral bodies, transverse processes (TVP's) and disc spaces to look for any 
fractures, DJD, increased and/or decreased densities, and block vertebrae. If a 
compression fracture of the vertebral body is suspected, look to see if it is the anterior or 
posterior vertebral body that is compressed. If the anterior vertebral body is compressed, 
it is most likely from trauma and/or osteoporosis. If the posterior verte bral body is 
compressed, this is usually not a good sign and may indicate the possibility of some kind 
of osteolytic disease. An increase in density of the vertebral body may indicate some kind 
of blastic disease. A decrease in density of the vertebral bod y may indicate possible lytic 
disease. If there is an ivory (or opaque) vertebra consider the following possible causes:  
Hodgkin's Lymphoma - Radiographically, this type of lymphoma can cause an ivory 
vertebra with scalloping both anteriorly and laterally due to the lymph node tissue 
pressing on the vertebral body.   Note: Hodgkin's disease tends to affect younger patients 
20-40 years old.  
Pagets - Radiographically, Pagets  can cause an ivory vertebra to develop with expansion 
and thickening of the cortex of the vertebra.   Note: Paget's disease tends to affect patients 
over the age of 50 and laboratory findings usually reveal an increase in alkaline 
phosphatase. 
Osteoblastic disease - Radiographically it can cause an ivory vertebra with anterior 
concavity of the vertebra and no cortical thickening.  
Note: Osteoblastic disease is the most common cause of an ivory vertebra.   Osteoblastic 
disease tends to affect patients over the age of 50 and laboratory findings usually reveal 
an increase in acid phosphatase.  
 
 
Degenerative sclerosis  or osteomyelitis  
 
Note:  Degenerative sclerosis tends to affect patients over the age of 50 and laboratory 
findings are usually normal.  
 
Osteomyelitis tends to affect younger patients between the ages of 2- 12 years old. 
Laboratory findings  may reveal increase in white blood cells and an increase in the ESR 
and CRP. The patient may also have a fever do to the infection.  
Assess for any block vertebra. If a block vertebra is suspected, consider one of the 
following: 
Synostosis (congenital) -typical radiographic appearance is a C -
shaped anterior body, (aka wasp waist vertebra), patent IVF (from 
fusion of the posterior facets) and a rudimentary disc.  
Ankylosis (pathological) -typical radiographic findings include 
severe decrease disc height from DJ D (fusion), facet joint sclerosis 
and osteophytosis.  
Arthodesis (surgical) -radiographically, there is no C -shaped anterior 
body, rudimentary disc or patent IVF. There also may be a lack of 
lamina or spinous processes because of surgery (a result of a 
lamin ectomy).  
Note: When there are multiple block vertebrae at two or more 
segments in the cervical and upper thoracic spine, along with the 
presence of a scoliosis and development of an anomalous rib, it is 
considered classic radiographic findings for a condition known 
as Klippel- Feil Syndrome . In addition, if there is a congenital 
failure of lowering of the scapula (sometimes referred to 
as congenital elevation of the scapula) along with these other 
radiographic findings, the condition is referred to as  Spreng le's 
deformity . This finding of scapula elevation is seen in 20- 25% of 
the cases of Klippel -Feil Syndrome. It should be noted that 
Sprengle's deformity could occur as a separate entity. In addition, 
30-40% of the cases of Sprengle's deformity tend to devel op 
omovertebral bone, which is cartilage or fibrous tissue extending 
from C5 or C6 spinous process, lamina or transverse process to the 
superior angle of the scapula. The scapula is usually hypoplastic and 
patients with Sprengle's deformity many times have  an associated 
scoliosis, hemivertebrae, block vertebrae, spina bifida occulta or 
cervical ribs.  
Assess the cervical curve for hyper, hypolordotic curve, or military neck (straight neck). 
Several methods are available to determine the cervical lordosis. Fo r the purposes of this 
course, Angle of Cervical Curve will be discussed:  
 
Two lines are drawn, one parallel to the inferior endplate of C7 vertebral body and the 
other through the midpoints of the anterior and posterior tubercles of C1. Perpendicular 
 
 
lines are then drawn to the point of intersection and the angle is measured. Normal 
measurement is 40 degrees with a minimum of 35 and a maximum of 45 degrees. A 
hypolordotic or reversed curve can be caused by trauma, muscle spasm and/or 
degenerative spondylosis. In addition, assess the posterior vertebral bodies to see if there 
is any break in George's line. This line is drawn at the posterior aspect of the vertebral 
bodies. A positive finding may indicate the possibility of an anterolisthesis, retrolisthesis,  
spondylolisthesis, fracture, dislocation, DJD or ligamentous laxity 
Assess the posterior arch for any lucency and/or agenesis. If there is agenesis of the 
posterior arch of C1, always look at C2 spinous process, which  usually becomes enlarged 
and is known as megaspinous process. Also, look at the anterior tubercle/arch for any 
hypertrophy, which is usually caused from stress. It should be noted that complete or 
partial agenesis of the posterior arch is rare. Assess the space between CO/C1 and C1/C2, 
which should be approximately equal. Be concerned with gross differences. If there is a 
gross difference between CO/C1 it may indicate occipitalization (aka assimilation), 
which can be caused from a bone softening disease like Pagets or Fibrous dysplasia or 
possibly from patient positioning. If you are unsure, take a flexion view to see if there is 
any opening of the spaces between CO/C1 and/or C1/C2. If you suspect a problem at 
CO/C1, you can evaluate by using Chamberlin's line and McGregor's line.  
A. McGregor's li ne (#1 method) - a line is drawn from posterior 
superior hard palate to inferior surface of occiput. Tip of dens 
should not be above line more than 8mm for men and 10mm for 
women. If positive finding, may possibly indicate basilar 
invagination/impression. 
B. Chamberlin's line - a line is drawn from the posterior hard palate to 
posterior aspect of foramen Magnum. Tip of dens should not extend 
more than 7mm above line. If it does, it may indicate a congenital 
problem or bone softening disease like Pagets or Fibrous dysplasia.  
Assess if there is any calcification of the atlanto -occiptial ligament, which indicates 
Posticus Ponticus, (aka Pons Posticus, Posterior Ponticle, Foramen Arcuale, or Kimmerly 
Anomaly).Many times this calcification forms a foramen called the a rcuate foramen for 
the passage of the vertebral artery and first cervical nerve. Note: This radiographic 
finding may possibly be a contraindication to cervical manipulation because of possible 
vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  
Assess the posterior elements -pedicles, articular pillars, superior and inferior facets (aka 
zygapophysis), lamina and spinous process. In addition, assess the posterior cervical line 
(lamina/spinous junction). If you do not see a fusion line, it may indicate a spina bifida 
occulta (fail ure of fusion of a secondary center of ossification). Pay special attention to 
the alignment of the posterior cervical line with reference to the other segments. If the 
alignment is off, it can indicate a spondylolisthesis, retrolisthesis, disclocation, fr acture, 
etc. If you see C1 slipped forward (anterior), consider the following possible causes:  
Fracture of dens  
RA, AS, Psoriatic, Reiters  
 
 
Trauma to transverse ligament (tear)  
Agenesis of dens  
Os Odontoidium (secondary growth center)  
Possible Infection 
Down's Syndrome (20% have agenesis of transverse ligament)  
 
If you see C1 slipped backward (posterior) consider the following possible 
causes:  
Fracture of dens  
Agenesis of dens  
Os Odontoidium (secondary growth center)  
 
If you see a lucency  at the spinous process, consider a secondary growth center 
(failure of fusion of the ossification center) or the possibility of a fracture of 
the spinous process known as Clay Shoveler's fracture (aka coal -miner's or 
root- puller's fracture) usually due to  a hyperflexion type injury (whiplash, 
diving injury, etc).  
Assess all areas of the mandible and occiput/skull on the film. If you are able to see the 
sella turica, assess the size. The normal horizontal dimension should be no greater than 
16mm and the depth no greater than 12mm. If enlarged, it may indicate a normal variant 
or possible space -occupying lesion i.e.: tumor, carotid aneurysm, empty sella syndrome 
(defect in the membrane of the roof of the sella caused by erosion from CSF). If you 
suspect an increase in the size of the sella turica, MRI is considered the test of choice to 
evaluate this finding.  
After you have completed looking at all the bony structures, you need to assess the soft 
tissue structures both anterior and posterior to the spine. Anterior structures include the 
following: 
Hyoid bone at the level of C3  
Thyroid cartilage at the level of C4-5 
Lymph nodes and/or vascular calcifications  
Air Shadows Retropharyngeal space anterior to C2, which should be 
no greater than 5mm and the Retrotracheal space anterior to C6, 
which should be no greater than 20mm  
 
Note:  If measurement is larger consider the following possible 
causes:  
Infection -pus 
Trauma- edema  
 
 
Tumor- neoplasm/malignancies  
Hemorrhage-blood 
 
Posterior structures to assess include the follow ing: 
Nuchal bone -calcification of the ligamentum nuchi or nuchal 
ligament 
Lymph node calcification i.e.: occipital, posterior cervical chain etc.  
 
AP LOWER CERVICAL (APLC):  
Give it your first impression -normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the patient 
is born with) versus acquired (something the patient developed over time either short 
term or long term).  
Note:  Starting point on the APLC scan depends on individual preference. The most 
important component is that all areas of the film are assessed —all osseous as well as soft 
tissue structures.  
Assess the transverse processes (TVP's) starting at the lower portion of the film and 
working up, looking for the last set of TVP's facing upward which is usually T1. Then 
continue up the  spine until you see the first set of TVP's pointing straight out or 
downward this is usually C7. Please note, C7 TVP normally does not extend beyond T1 
TVP. Assess this area for the following possibilities: 
Cervical rib -look for a joint space.  Note:  1% of  the population has cervical ribs and only 
10% have associated symptoms, which may produce thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)  
 Elongated TVP -no joint space  
 Secondary growth center at tip of TVP  
 Assess the spinous processes looking for the following:  
A. Spina bifida occulta - radiographically, would reveal a vertical 
luscent line through the spinous process. This is where the two 
lamina fail to fuse together during osseous development. Spina 
bifida occulta is of no clinical significance and occurs more in males 
than females (9:1 ratio).  
B. Spina bifida vera -radiographically, would reveal a wide defect in the 
posterior neural arch at multiple levels at the site of involvement. In 
addition, a soft tissue mass located posteriorly, anteriorly, or 
laterally to the spine ma y be seen. This mass represents the 
meningocele or myleomenigocele, which is a sac filled with 
cerebrospinal fluid that covers the spinal cord. Spina bifida vera can 
be diagnosed at the 18th fetal week by assay of alpha fetoprotein 
from maternal serum or f rom amniotic fluid aspirate. When seen 
radiographically, a myelography, MRI or ultrasonography is needed 
to determine if the soft tissue mass (fluid -filled sac) contains any 
 
 
spinal cord. Spina bifida vera is of clinical significance because the 
patient may  have several skin problems i.e.: hairy or pigmented 
patch, malformed fibrous tissue and blood vessels and fatty tumors 
(lipomas). In a severe case, the fluid -filled sac may be seen at birth. 
In addition, the child may have clubbed feet and paralysis. In a  mild 
case, the child may not show any gait or motor problems until age 5 
or 6. 
C. Double spinous process sign- radiographically, would reveal a 
horizontal line through the spinous process giving the appearance of 
two spinous processes, which is indicative of a Clay Shoveler's 
fracture (aka coal -miner's or root -puller's fracture) seen on an APLC 
view, caused from a hyperflexion injury (whiplash, diving injury, 
etc.). C7 is the most common spinous process involved, but it can 
also occur at C6 and T1. Clay Shovel er's fracture is considered a 
stable fracture and does not cause any neurological problems.  
Assess the vertebral bodies, pedicles, articular pillars (superior/inferior facets (aka 
zygoapophysis) and TVP's as well as any curvature to the spine scoliosis (le vo)-left vs. 
(dextro)- right. When assessing the vertebral bodies look for fractures, DJD, and 
increased/decreased densities as previously mentioned in part four of this course. Assess 
the uncinate processes (aka joints of VonLuschka or uncovertebral joints , which are 
located at the superior posterolateral aspect of the vertebra C3 -C7. These joints are 
pseudojoints that have a synovial membrane with synovial fluid but no joint capsule. 
They serve as tracks that guide the motion of coupled lateral flexion and ipsilateral 
rotation. These joints also serve to strengthen and stabilize the cervical spine. They 
develop at six years of age and are completed by eighteen. Keep in mind, the most 
common cause of IVF encroachment is hypertrophy of the uncinate processes.  
After assessing,  the spine look at any part of the mandible and manubrium that may be 
visible and look at the clavicles and upper ribs. Normal variants to consider when 
assessing the clavicles and first rib:  
Rhomboid fossa -located inferior medial surface of clavicle, no 
clinical significance, represents a developmental variation at the 
insertion of the rhomboid ligament.  
Companion shadow of clavicle -no clinical significance represents 
subcutaneous tissue, which runs parallel with clavicle.  
Prominent conoid  tubercle of the clavicle- located at the inferior 
distal 1/3 of the clavicle. This normal variant should be 
differentiated from ossification of the coracoclavicular ligament. 
This can be done by radiographic appearance, which usually reveals 
a smooth corticated margin and no history of trauma with a 
prominent conoid tubercle.  
Costochondral calcification first rib -radiographically, the joint 
appears irregular and prominent. This is of no clinical significance.  
 
 
After you have completed looking at all the bony  structures,  you need to assess the soft 
tissue structures, which  are as follows:  
Trachea air shadow -usually starts at the lower border of C5 and 
descends to T4- 5, where it bifurcates to the left and right bronchi. 
Look to see if there is any deviation of the air shadow, which may 
be caused by an atelectasis (a collapsed lung), which tends to suck 
or pull the trachea towards the collapsed lung. Also, look for any 
deviation possibly caused from a soft tissue mass, which tends to 
push the trachea away from th e mass.  
Soft tissue calcifications in the neck (i.e.: vessel, lymph nodes and 
thyroid gland)  
Vessel calcification - tends to run parallel to spine, vessels involved are carotid artery 
and/or vertebral artery. Carotid artery calcification tends to run adjacent to the spine 
where vertebral artery runs over the spine where the foramen transversium are located. 
Keep in mind, vertebral artery calcification is very rare and not often seen on plain film 
x-rays.  
Lymph node calcification- tends to be scattered in the soft tissues adjacent to the spine.  
Thyroid cartilage calcification -usually located over the spine at the levels of C5 through 
C7 and tends run in an oblique direction.  
Apices of lungs -look for calcifications i.e.: lymph nodes, azygos 
fissure, azygos vein or possible calcification and/or aneurysm of the 
aortic knob, as well as any tumors i.e.; Pancost (supersulcus) tumor. 
If you suspect a Pancost tumor, look for the following four cardinal 
signs:  
 Mass in apex of lung  
 Destruction of adjacent rib and/or vertebra  
 Pain down the arm  
 Horner's Syndrome  
 
Note:  Horner's Syndrome affects the cervical thoracic sympathetic nerves causing the 
following. 
Meiosis -constriction of pupi l 
Anhydrosis- loss of sweating on involved side of forehead 
Ptosis -closing of eyelid  
Note:  The diagnosis of a Pancost tumor should be differentiated 
with the following:  
Apical pleural thickening- caused as a result of inflammatory 
disease.  
 
 
Companion shadow of clavicle- which is a subcutaneous tissue 
shadow running parallel with the clavicle.  
Shadow of sternocleidomastoid muscle -which tends to runs vertical 
to the spine.

Colles’ Fracture 
 
Description :  A Colles' fracture refers to an extra-articula r, transverse fracture of the distal radial 
shaft.  It most commonly occurs within 1 in. of  the articular surface, cau sing dorsal angulation of 
the distal fragment in the me taphyseal area, giving the appearance of an upside-down dinner 
fork, radial deviation of ha nd, swelling and ecchymosis.  Severe point tenderness over the 
fracture site can be found with palpation.  Deforming forces in a colles’ fracture lead to:  
• Ulnar positive variance:  The radius is comp ressed (radial shortening) and the ulna is 
now too high.  This causes a radial shift of the wrist and hand. Measurements less than 
9mm in radial length in adults sugg est comminuted or impacted fractures. 
• Changes in radial tilt:  Normal tilt is 15-25 de grees.  Changes in angulation of the radial 
head may also suggest impaction. 
• Changes in radial volar tilt:  Loss of vola r tilt causes difficulty with wrist flexion.  
 Many classification systems have been used to desc ribe fractures involving the distal end of the 
radius such as the AO system and the Frykman system.  However, the Frykman classification, 
which is a modification of AO, is more useful fo r the therapist and surge on.  It is based on the 
mechanism of injury and supports specific treatm ent guidelines for each classifiable injury.  
(Refer to Journal of Hand Therapy  article listed in reference section for classification system 
table).  AO Classification of Colles’ Fractures  
Type Description  
A Extra-articular  
B Partial articular  
C 
1 2 3 Complete articular 
Simple articular and metaphyseal fracture Simple articular with complex metaphyseal fracture Complex articular and metaphyseal fracture 
 If severe enough, Colles’ fractures may heal with some residual malalignment such as a shortened radius or a distal radial displacemen t, which disrupt the relationship of the distal 
radioulnar joint articular surfaces .  This malalignments results in permanent loss of full wrist 
mobility.  Other common complications of Colles’ fracture include associated carpal fracture or ligamentous tear, triangular fibrocartilage comple x (TFCC) tear, distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) 
subluxation or dislocation, acute post reducti on swelling/compartment syndrome.  Late 
complications include extensor policus longus r upture, reflex sympathetic dystrophy (at times 
associated with distraction of an external fixator), median nerve compression/carpal tunnel 
syndrome, malunion, and contractures.  Each of these conditions should be addressed early to 
avoid a more disabling result.

Etiology :  Most common mechanism of injury is a fall on an outstretched hand. The wrist usually 
lands in extension and the forear m in pronation.  The lunate acts as a wedge to shear the radius 
off in a dorsal direction.  The dorsal surf ace undergoes compression while the volar surface 
undergoes tension.  The momentum from the fall often caused sprain of the ulnar collateral 
ligament and an avulsion fracture on the ulnar st yloid process. 
 
Non-operative versus Operative Management :  Indications for non-operative management 
include patients with stable, non-displaced or mi nimally displaced fractures as well as patients 
with poor wound healing and/or medical illnesses that preclude them from surgery and those 
with sedentary lifestyles and lo w functional demands.  They can be managed non-surgically by 
closed reduction, combination cast and splint immob ilization of the wrist fo r about 6 to 8 weeks, 
and instituting early range of moti on exercises when pain permits. 
Surgical treatment is indicated for unstable/dis placed, severely comminuted, or intra-articular 
distal radius fractur es. An unstable injury is defined as a fracture that does not reduce adequately 
with closed fracture manipulati on or that loses reduction below acceptable reduction parameters 
despite appropriate immobilizati on techniques.  The goal is to restore articular congruity and 
axial alignment, including radial length, volar tilt, radi al inclination, as well as maintenance of 
reduction, achievement of bony union, and rest oration of hand and wrist function. 
 Surgical Procedure:   High-energy injuries ar e often associated with extensive swelling, and 
operative intervention should be performed afte r swelling has decreased, usually several days 
after injury.  Various surgical methods includ e percutaneous pinning, ex ternal fixation, or open 
reduction and internal fixation (ORI F) with volar or dorsal plating.

X-RAY SCAN AP OPEN MOUTH (APOM) AND THORACIC SCAN 
(LATERAL):  
 
AP OPEN MOUTH (APOM):  
Give it your first impression —normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the patient 
is born with) versus acquired (something the patient develops over time either short or 
long term).  
Note:  Starting point for the APOM scan depends on the individual's preference. The most 
important component is that all areas of the film are assessed including all osseous  and 
soft tissue structures. Keep in mind that the APOM is a limited view, primarily 
comprising C1, C2, and portions of the maxilla and mandible.  
Assess C2 vertebral body looking to see if there is a compression fracture, 
DJD, or any increased/decreased densities as previously mentioned in part four 
of this course. In addition, look at the pedicles, lamina, bifid spinous process, 
articular pillars (superior/inferior facets (aka zygoapophysis), and TVP's.  
Assess the odontoid process for alignment, height, and any lucency at the base 
or tip of the dens. If there is a lucency at the base of the dens, consider the 
following possibilities: 
Fracture- look for a jagged line (usually thin and lucent)  
Os Odontoidium (secondary growth center) -look for a smooth line 
(usually thick and lucent)  
Complete agenesis of dens (aka odontoid aplasia or no dens), which 
is considered a rare finding, or partial agenesis of the dens 
(hypoplastic dens) which is seen radiographically as a stump of 
bone projecting a little above C1- C2 ar ticulation  
 
 
Malposition of C1- may cause a mock defect from the ring of the 
arch of the atlas giving you the appearance that the odontoid process 
may have a fracture or congenital anomaly.  
Note:  A conservative, inexpensive way to determine a malposition 
of C1 (mock defect) is to retake the view. If it is truly a mock 
defect, then it should not be seen on the retake.  
If there is a lucency at the tip of the dens, consider the following:  
Fracture- look for jagged line (usually thin and lucent)  
Os Terminale  (secondary growth center) look for smooth lines 
(usually a symmetrical, "V" shaped lucent cleft)  
Assess C1 -the lateral masses, anterior and posterior arches, articular 
facets and joint space, TVP's, foramen transversarium.  In addition, 
assess th e paraodontoid spaces, atlantoaxial alignment, maxilla, 
mandible and any part of the skull that can be seen i.e.: occiput, 
mastoid air cells etc.  
When assessing the arch of the atlas on the APOM, consider the 
following helpful method to help differentiate which arch you are 
looking at: Imagine the arch as a mouth, or pair of lips. The 
posterior arch gives the appearance of the lower lip where the 
corners go up. The anterior arch gives the appearance of the upper 
lip where the corners go down. Look to see if  there is a radiolucent 
vertical line at the posterior arch of C1, which would indicate failure 
of fusion of the posterior arch of C1 (aka posterior spondyloschisis). 
When assessing the paraodontoid spaces, look to see if they are 
equal bilaterally. When assessing the atlantoaxial alignment, check 
to see that the lateral masses (lateral margins) of the atlas masses are 
in alignment with the lateral corners of the axis articular surface. If 
the lateral margins do not align properly, consider the following 
possible causes:  
  
Jefferson bursting fracture —a break in C1 arch in two or more spots 
usually caused by an axial compression, which transmits force 
through the occipital condyles to the lateral masses of atlas ca using 
the atlas to slide off the C2 facets. Death or neurological deficit is 
not commonly associated with this type of fracture. Approximately 
50% of patients with this type of fracture will have persistent pain 
and stiffness in their neck and occipital dysesthesia.  
Odontoid fracture  
Alar ligament in stability  
Rotatory atlantoaxial subluxation  
Note:  If there is a laterally tilted odontoid process of more than 5 
degrees and the lateral masses of C1 (lateral margins) do not align 
 
 
with the lateral corners of the axis articular surface, then there is a 
70% chance a fracture of the odontoid process is present.  
Note:  Children 4 years old or younger who reveal radiographically 
that the atlantoaxial alignment is not properly aligned would be 
classified as having a normal variant, which is caused by accelerated 
growth of the atlas.  
Assess any soft tissue structures that can be seen. As a general rule, 
the soft tissue structures for the APOM are limited.  
THORACIC SCAN (LATERAL VIEW):  
Give it your first impression —normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the patient 
is born with) versus acquired (something the patient develops over time, either short or 
long term).  
Assess the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies, paying special attention to the anterior 
longitudinal ligament (ALL) as previously discussed in part three of this course.  
Here is what to look for when assessing the anterior aspect of the vertebral 
bodies of the thoracic spine:  
Thin vertical calcification along the ALL, referred to as marginal syndesmophytes. This 
is usually associated with Ankylosing Spondylitis, (aka Marie Strumpell's disease, an 
inflammatory arthritis). Depending upon the stage of the disease, radiographically the 
patient may have fusion of the posterior facets, IVD and costal articulations.  In addition, 
the patient may have an increase in kyphosis and osteoporosis. They may also have a 
decrease in chest expansion. Lab findings HLA -B27 are positive in 90% of patients with 
ankylosing spondylitis, ESR is increased in the active phase of the disease, CBC reveals 
mild anemia, and RA factor is negative.  
Large flowing spurs along the ALL, referred to as hyperostosis.  These findings are 
usually associated with DISH (diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis), (aka Forestiers 
diease or Ankylosing hyperostosis). Clinically, it is typically seen in males over the age 
of 50 and may cause dysphagia and adult onset diabetes mellitus. The symptomatology 
tends to vary because joint motion is usually unaffected. Radiographically, it does not 
affect the posterior facets or IVD (no fusion) and usual ly the disc spaces are maintained 
at three or more levels. The thoracic spine is the most common region of involvement, 
usually between T7 and T11. Because of the pulsations of the aorta on the left side, the 
development of large flowing spurs (hyperostosis) tend to develop on the right side only. 
Lab findings may demonstrate increased glucose levels (32% of patients diagnosed with 
DISH may have adult onset of diabetes mellitus). The patient may also have a positive 
HLA -B8, seen in approximately 40% of pati ents with DISH.  
Lipping and spurring along the ALL (horizontal projections of bone coming off the 
anterior vertebral bodies and/or posterior vertebral bodies) is referred to as 
spondylophytes, exostosis or osteophytes and are usually associated with DJD, ( aka 
osteoarthritis or wear and tear disease). Clinically, it is typically more common in 
females ages 50 and up. These patients tend to complain of pain and stiffness with 
crepitus during movement of the joints. In addition, they may complain or present wi th 
 
 
swelling of the joints. DJD is the most common form of arthritis. Weightbearing joints 
are usually affected. Vacuum sign (aka vacuum phenomenon) is an important early sign 
of DJD. Vacuum sign usually indicates degeneration of the disc and indicates that  
intersegmental motion is occurring. As a general rule with DJD, radiographically the 
joints are affected asymmetrically with nonuniform loss of joint space. Depending upon 
the stage of the arthritis, osteophytic formation, subchondral sclerosis, subchondr al cysts, 
and degenerative subluxations may be present. Lab findings with DJD are usually 
normal. The following findings in the spine are typical of DJD.  
Lipping/ /spurring anterior and/or posterior vertebral body  
Decreased disc space or height  
Subchondral sclerosis at vertebral endplates  
 
CONTINUATION THORACIC SPINE (LATERAL VIEW):  
Assess the vertebral bodies and disc spaces to look for fractures, DJD, increased and/or 
decreased densities, Hahn's venous clefts and Scheuermann's disease. If a com pression 
fracture of the vertebral body is suspected, look to see if the anterior vertebral body (as 
opposed to the posterior vertebral body) is compressed. If the anterior vertebral body is 
compressed, it is more likely from trauma and/or osteoporosis. If  the posterior vertebral 
body is compressed, this is usually not a good sign and may indicate the possibility of 
some kind of osteolytic disease. An increase in density of the vertebral body may indicate 
some kind of blastic disease. A decrease in density of the vertebral body may indicate 
possible lytic disease. If a thin linear lucency located across the center of the thoracic 
vertebrae is visible, one should not confuse this finding with a pathology. This finding 
most likely represents a normal variant known as Hahn's venous clefts, which are venous 
grooves. In the case of an ivory (or opaque) vertebra, one should consider the following 
possible causes:  
Hodgkin's Lymphoma —radiographically, it may cause an ivory vertebra with scalloping 
both anteriorly and laterally on the vertebra. The scalloping is caused by the lymph node 
tissue presseing on the vertebral body. (Hodgkin's disease tends to affect younger patients 
20-40 years old.)  
Pagets —radiographically, it can cause an ivory vertebra to develop with expansion and 
thickening of the cortex of the vertebra. (Paget's disease tends to affect patients over the 
age of 50 and laboratory findings usually reveal an increase in alkaline phosphatase.)  
Osteoblastic disease —radiographically, it can cause an ivory vert ebra with anterior 
concavity of the vertebra and no cortical thickening.  
Note:  Osteoblastic disease is the most common of these to cause an ivory vertebra, and 
tends to affect patients over the age of 50. Laboratory findings usually reveal an increase 
in acid phosphatase.  
Degenerative sclerosis (Degenerative sclerosis tends to affect patients over the age of 50 
and laboratory findings are usually normal.)  
 
 
Osteomyelitis (Osteomyelitis tends to affect younger patients between the ages of 2 -12 
years old. Laboratory findings may reveal an increase in white blood cells and an 
increase in the ESR and CRP. The patient may also have a fever due to the infection.)  
 
As for Scheuermann's disease, it tends to present in adolescents, males tend to 
be affected more often than females, and the cause is unk nown. Patients may 
complain of  spinal pain and have an increase in thoracic kyphosis, causing a 
deformity of the spine. They are usually more prone to developing early 
degenerative disc disease and disc herniations in the thoracic spine. The 
disease tends to affect the middle and lower thoracic spine and a mild scoliosis 
is usually present. Clinically, the patient has tenderness on palpation and 
percussion of the spinous processes. The hamstrings, iliopsoas and pectoral 
muscles are many times hypertonic. Diagnosis is usually made by both clinical 
and radiographic findings. Radiographically, there is anterior vertebral 
wedging, multiple Schmorl's nodes (irregular vertebral endplates) and 
narrowing of the intervertebral discs.  It is important to note that 50% of 
patients with Scheuermann's disease can have spondylolysis and 50% will 
have degenerative changes at the thoracic spine.  
Assess the posterior elements —pedicles, superior and inferior facets (aka zygapophysis), 
TVP's, la mina and spinous process.  
Assess the thoracic curve for hyper - or hypokyphotic curve, flat back (aka straight back) 
utilizing Thoracic Kyphosis Measurement and Thoracic Cage Dimension.  
 
Thoracic Kyphosis Measurement —draw a parallel line through the superi or endplate of 
the first thoracic vertebral body and another parallel line through the inferior endplate of 
the twelfth thoracic vertebral body. Then, draw perpendicular lines from these lines and 
measure where the lines intersect. The angle varies dependi ng on the sex and age of the 
patient. Males tend to be between 40 and 66 degrees, and females between 36 and 56 
degrees. It should be noted that an increase kyphosis can be seen with older patients, 
osteoporotic patients, Scheuermann's disease, congenital anomalies, muscular paralysis 
and cystic fibrosis. A decrease kyphosis (straight back syndrome) may change the 
dynamics of the intracardiac blood flow and mimic a possible cardiac murmur.  
 
Thoracic Cage Dimension —measure the distance between the posterior sternum and 
anterior surface of the eighth thoracic vertebral body. Normal measurements in a male 
should be 14cm with a maximum of 18cm and a minimum of 11cm. Females should be 
12cm with a maximum of 15cm and a minimum of 9cm. If a patient has a flat back (aka 
straight back), the normal measurement in males is 11cm and females 10cm.  
Assess the axillary border of the scapula, which is usually overlying the upper portion of 
the thoracic spine.   Also, assess any ribs that may be visualized and the anterior bony 
chest wall sternum looking for any deformities i.e.; Pectus Excavatum (aka funnel chest, 
a depression at the sternum) and Pectus Carinatum (aka pigeon chest, an anterior 
displacement of the sternum). In many cases, these anterior bony chest wall disorder s can 
be observed during physical examination of the patient.  
 
 
Assess any soft tissue structures that may be visualized i.e.; diaphragm, heart, lungs, 
tracheal air shadow, and retrosternal space. Keep in mind that the right diaphragm tends 
to be seen stretching across the whole lower thorax and passes through the lower portion 
of the heart shadow, whereas the left diaphragm disappears as it reaches the posterior 
border of the heart. Typically, the right hemidiaphragm is higher than the left. Assess the 
heart  shadow for size and density. The lungs should be assessed looking at the peripheral 
and hilar portion for any increased or decreased densities i.e.; opacities (white areas) or 
lucency (black areas). Assess the posterior costophrenic sulcus for any obliter ation, and 
look to see if there are any lung fissures present. In addition, look at the trachea air 
shadow for any kind of deviation or shifting and assess the retrosternal space for any 
masses.  
 
X-RAY SCAN THORACIC SPINE (AP VIEW):  
 
THORACIC SPINE (AP VIE W): 
Give it your first impression —normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the patient 
is born with) versus acquired (something the patient develops over time, either short or 
long term).  
Assess all bony structures i.e.; vertebrae, pedicles, lamina, s pinous process, superior and 
inferior facets (aka zygapophysis), TVP's, ribs (costotransverse and costovertebral joints), 
manubrium, clavicle and scapula. When assessing the vertebral body, look for any 
compression fractures and try to differentiate between pathological vs. nonpathological as 
previously discussed in part seven of this course under lateral thoracic spine. Look for 
any hemivertebra more commonly seen at the lower thoracic spine and look for any 
increased or decreased density changes in the vertebral body as previously discussed in 
part seven of this course under lateral thoracic spine. Assess the pedicles for missing 
pedicle sign, hypertrophy of the opposite pedicle, or a radiopaque pedicle. If there is an 
absence of the pedicle without hypertrophy of the opposite pedicle, consider the 
possibility of metastatic carcinoma. If there is an absence of the pedicle and the opposite 
pedicle shows hypertrophy along with the presence of reactive sclerosis, consider a long-
standing congenital lesion, the  result of a stress response. If you see both pedicles and 
one appears sclerotic, consider the cause to be possibly from an osteoid osteoma.  
 
Osteoid osteoma is a benign painful tumor, which primarily affects younger patients 
between the ages of 10 -25. Sym ptoms are usually described as a deep, achy pain with a 
gradual onset, which increases in severity over time. Rest and/or exercise do not relieve 
pain, and pain seems to increase at night. Patients' with night pain may experience 
significant relief with as pirin. The location  of osteoid osteoma is usually in the femur and 
tibia (50% of the time) and in the spine (10% of the time). When the spine is involved, it 
can occur in the thoracic, lumbar, cervical or sacrum. 60% of spinal lesions occur in the 
lumbar s pine in the neural arch (i.e.; lamina, pedicles, facet and spinous process). 
Radiographically, a common finding is a radiopaque pedicle. This needs to be 
differentiated from a hypertrophied pedicle, caused from agenesis of the opposing 
pedicle.  
 
 
 
Note:  Treatment of choice for osteoid osteoma is usually surgical excision with 
immediate relief of symptoms. Recurrence is rare. Continue looking at the thoracic bony 
structures assessing the lamina, making sure there is appropriate fusion of the lamina to 
form the  spinous process. Assess spinous process for any spina bifida occulta, fractures, 
or deformities. Look at both the superior and inferior facets and TVP's for any nonunion 
(secondary growth centers), agenesis, fractures and/or hypertrophy. Assess the ribs f or 
any fractured ribs, hypoplastic ribs, bifurcated ribs, or fused ribs (congenital synostosis). 
Look for any costochondral cartilage calcification, which is a normal variant seen in 
children and adults and is of no clinical significance. Assess the manubr ium, clavicles 
and scapula for any fractures and/or secondary growth centers. When assessing the 
clavicles also look for any normal variants like a rhomboid fossa, companion shadow, or 
prominent conoid tubercle as previously discussed in part five of this course under APLC  
Assess for any scoliosis (lateral deviation of the spinal column from the midsagittal 
plane).  
Two Main Categories of Scoliosis:  Structural vs. Nonstructural  
Structural Scoliosis  - a lateral curvature that is fixed and does not correct 
upon motion.  
 
Classifications of Structural Scoliosis:  
Idiopathic scoliosis -considered the most common and represents up to 80% of the 
scolioses. The most common curve pattern is a right convex thoracic curve. Cause 
unknown. Three types of idiopathic scoliosis: 
A. Infantile - less than 3 years  
B. Juvenile 3- 10 years  
C. Adolescent - greater than 10 years  
 
Note:  Adolescent is the most common type of idiopathic scoliosis. 
A common finding in a scoliosis in the adolescent idiopathic type is 
a lateral wedged defo rmity of the vertebral body, which remains in 
adult life. This deformity is caused by a lack of development located 
at the discovertebral junction on the concave side of the curvature 
because of either excessive or inadequate compressive. (This is 
known as  Hueter -Volkmann principle.)  
Note:  Idiopathic scoliosis of 15 degrees or more that occurs before 
the age of eleven should be considered suspicious of a significant 
intraspinal pathology. A severe or rapidly progressing left -sided 
thoracic/thoracolumbar sco liosis (the opposite of the classic 
idiopathic scoliosis) should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out the 
possibility of some kind of intraspinal pathology i.e.: spinal tumor, 
syringomyelia, or Arnold- Chiari malformation.  
Congenital Scoliosis - recognized by anomalies of the vertebrae or ribs. The most 
common anomalies seen with congenital scoliosis are hemivertebrae, block vertebrae, 
 
 
fusion of ribs, or spina bifida. Congenital scoliosis is often associated with anomalies of 
the genitourinary system.  
Neuromus cular Scoliosis -caused by some kind of nerve or muscle disease i.e.; Cerebral 
palsy, syringomyelia, poliomyelitis, or muscular dystrophy.  
Neurofibromatosis - inherited congenital disorder of neuro and mesoectodermal tissue 
(nerves and skin). Scoliosis deformity is a short angular kyphosis with dysplasia of the 
vertebral body.  
Miscellaneous causes of structural scoliosis  
Trauma to the spine from fractures/dislocations  
Infections from tuberculosis which can lead to 
deformities i.e.; Gibbus deformity (angular k yphosis) 
Advanced DJD  
Radiation therapy on a growing spine for Wilm's tumor 
and neuroblastoma  
Tumors of bone, connective tissue disorders and possibly 
spinal surgery 
 
Nonstructural (aka) Functional Scoliosis - a curvature that has no structural 
deformity and corrects upon motion. Some common causes are leg length 
inequality, postural, hysteria, antalgia from a disc herniation, possible tumor 
and/or inflammatory bowel disease etc.  
 
Common Complications of Scoliosis:  
Cardiopulmonary disease  
DJD 
Deformity  
Pain 
Classifications of Scoliosis Based on Location:  
Cervical  
Cervicothoracic 
Mid Thoracic  
Thoracolumbar 
Lumbar 
Lumbosacral  
Double Lumbar and Thoracic  
 
 
Radiographic Assessment of Scoliosis Utilizing Plain Film X -rays:  
 
Four Methods -Curvature Measurem ent, Rotation, Flexibility and 
Maturation  
Curvature Measurement -consists of two methods (Cobb and Risser -
Ferguson Method)  
Cobb Method- most accepted method for measuring scoliotic 
deviation . A line is drawn along the superior end plate of the 
cephalad vertebrae at the most extreme point of the scoliosis.   Then, 
a line is drawn along the inferior end plate of the caudad vertebrae 
at the most extreme point of the scoliosis. Perpendicular lines are 
then drawn at right angles from both the superior and inferior end 
plate lines and the angle is measured where they intersect . For 
curves less than 20 degrees, no bracing or surgical intervention is 
required. Patients between the ages of 10 and 15 with a curvature of 
less than 20 degrees should be monitored every three months. 
Curves between 20- 40 degrees should be braced (Milwaukee brace) 
and monitored every three months until maturity. Curves more than 
40 degrees are considered surgical candidates utilizing Harrington 
rods or Dwyer procedure (screws and wires).  
Note:  Treatment of scoliosis is based upon curve progression and its 
effects on cosmetic appearance and body function. Conservative 
treatment would consist of exercises, spinal manipulation and 
physiotherapy. Goals of treatment are to relieve pain, prevent 
progression, increase ROM, restore strength and stability to joints 
and rehabilitate muscles.  
Note: With spinal manipulation, always approach from the 
convexity of the curve.  
Risser -Ferguson Method -locate both the cephalad and caudad 
vertebrae at the most extr eme point of the scoliosis as described in 
the Cobb method. Then, locate the most lateral vertebra between 
these vertebrae which is considered the apical vertebra. For each of 
these vertebrae, draw diagonal lines from opposite corners of the 
vertebral bodi es and locate the area where the lines cross on each of 
these vertebra. The lines should intersect at the center of each of 
these vertebral bodies. Then draw lines from the center of the 
cephalad vertebra and caudad vertebra to the center of the apical 
vertebra and measure the angle where they intersect at the apical 
vertebra. This method gives measurements approximately 25% 
below that of the Cobb method and therefore is not as accurate.  
 
Rotation Analysis —(Consists of two methods: Spinous Method and 
Pedicl e Method)  
Spinous method- assessing rotation based upon spinous process 
deviation. This is not reliable because of spinous malformation.  
 
 
Pedicle method - most accepted method to determine rotation . 
This method assesses rotation of the vertebra using the pedicles as 
the reference point. Look at the movement of the pedicle on the 
convex side of the curve. It is graded between 0 and 4 and is 
considered a measurement of anterior deformity. 0 is no rotation 
(normal) where 4 is complete rotation of the pedicle from one side 
to the opposite side.  
 
Flexibility Evaluation by Lateral Bending —a method to assess the degree of 
mobility within a scoliosis. This method also assesses the correctability and 
evaluates the prognosis of a scoliosis. The spine (radiograph) is evaluated in 
the neutral position first, then evaluated in both left and right lateral flexion to 
determine if the curve disappears. If the curve disappears, it would indicate a 
nonstructural scoliosis. If the curve does not disappear, it would indicate a 
structural scoliosis.  
Note:  If there is failure of the scoliosis (curvature) to correct on lateral 
bending, then the scoliosis (curvature) is considered irreversible and 
nonprogressive. 
 
Skeletal Maturation —is important when trying to determining skeletal 
maturity and is essential in determining treatment and prognosis. One common 
indicator of spinal maturity is evaluating the iliac epiphysis (Risser's Sign) to 
see if complete fusion has occurred. The epiphysis is divided into 4 equal 
quarters starting at the lateral portion of the iliac crest and progressing 
posteriorly and medially towards the posterior superior iliac spine. When 
complete fusion finally occurs, it is considered a fifth quarter. Curve 
progression usually stops in females with a Risser Sign of 4 and in males with 
a Risser Sign of 5.  
 
Determining when MRI should be ordered on a Scoliosis Patient:  
A. Patients with a scoliosis younger than 11 years old  
B. A thoracic and/or thoracolumbar scoliosis progressing quickly  
C. Absent family history of scoliosis  
D. A scoliosis in a young patient that has no real movement (stiff/rigid)  
E. A patient with scoliosis that has pain and does not seem to respond 
to conservative treatment  
F. Abnormal radiographic findings i.e.; hemivertebrae, basilar 
impression, pedicle widening, or enlarged spinal canal diameter.  
G. Positive neurological findings i.e.; muscle weakness, muscle 
atrophy, sensory loss, cranial nerve problem, abnormal DTR's, or 
dysfunction with bladder or bowel.  
 
 
 
 
Things to Consider When Performing a Chiropractic Spinal Analysis 
Examination: 
 
The patient's posture should always be examined by visually observing the 
anterior, posterior and lateral aspects of the patient.  
Anterior- look for muscle imbalance (hypertrophy vs. atrophy), 
chest deformities (barrel chest, pectus excavatum or funnel chest, 
and pectus carinatum or pigeon chest).  
Posterior- look for muscle imbalance (hypertrophy vs. atrophy), 
head tilt, shoulder height, scapula height/winging, rib cage 
deformity, pelvic unleveling and spinal curvature (scoliosi s). 
Lateral -look for anterior head carriage (translation aka protraction 
and/or retraction), normal cervical, thoracic, lumbar and 
lumbosacral curves (increase/decrease lordotic/kyphotic curves), 
sway back, flat back, Dowager's hump, Gibbus deformity and barrel 
chest.  
The patient should also be examined for upper cross syndrome and lower cross 
syndrome. 
Upper Cross Syndrome -elevation and protraction of the shoulders, 
rotation and abduction (winging) of the scapula and forward head 
posture. Usually a result of weak deep neck flexors, rhomboids and 
serratus anterior muscles and tight pectorals, upper trapezius and 
levator scapula muscles.  
Lower Cross Syndrome- anteriorly rotated pelvis, increase lumbar 
lordosis and slight flexion of the hips. Usually a result of weak 
gluteus maximus and abdominal muscles and tight erector spinae 
and iliopsoas muscles.  
Assess any soft tissue structures that may be visualized i.e.; diaphragm, heart, lungs, 
tracheal air shadow, costal cartilage, gastric air bubble known as magenblasum and 
aorta.   Look for the following:  
Look for displacement, enlargement, density changes, and 
calcifications.  
When looking at the diaphragm, the right should be higher than the 
left because of the heart. The difference between the heights of the 
diaphra gm should be no more than 3cm.  
Assess the heart shadow for size and density- the heart shadow 
should be no greater than 1/2 of the transthoracic diameter.  
Look at the lung fields for any increased or decreased densities i.e.;  
opacities (white areas) or lucency (black areas). Look for any lung 
fissures that may be visualized i.e.; horizontal, oblique and/or 
 
 
azygos fissures. Displacement of a fissure may be a sign of a 
collapsed lung.  
Determine that the left hilar region is high er than the right because 
of the heart. Assess the size, shape and density of the hila.  
Look at the tracheal air shadow, which is located slightly more on 
the right side because of the aortic arch. Look for the trachea 
bifurcation at the level of T4 -5 and assess for any deviation, which 
may be caused from a lesion in the lung, a problem with the 
mediastinum, an infection, trauma, hemorrhage etc.  
Look at the gastric air bubble, which is normally located on the left 
side in the stomach below the diaphragm. If  the gastric air bubble is 
seen above diaphragm, think possible hiatal hernia.  
Look at the aorta for any atherosclerotic calcification, tortuosity 
and/or aneurysm formation. Thoracic aortic aneurysms can occur in 
several locations along the aorta i.e.; ascending thoracic aorta, aortic 
arch and descending thoracic aorta. Of these thoracic aortic 
aneurysms, the least common area is the ascending thoracic aorta. 
The most common thoracic aortic aneurysm is the aortic arch. The 
aorta is the most common vessel to  develop an aneurysm and the 
number one cause is atherosclerosis. Men are more affected than 
females in a 4 to 1 ratio. More than 95% of atherosclerotic 
aneurysms happen between the ages of 60 and 80. Calcification of 
the aorta increases with age and in patients age 45 and older 40% 
tend to have a positive finding for calcification on plain film x- rays. 
The most common location for an aortic aneurysm as well as most 
frequently seen calcified vessel is in the abdomen specifically the 
abdominal aorta which will be discussed in detail in section nine 
and ten under lumbar spine scan. In addition, assessment of the 
costophrenic and cardiac angles should be done looking for any 
obliteration.  
 
Note: When evaluating the AP thoracic spine, if lung pathology is possibly 
suspected a chest film should be performed and/or ordered to further evaluate any 
suspicious findings  
 
X-RAY SCAN LUMBAR SPINE (LATERAL VIEW):  
1. Give it your first impression—normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the 
patient is born with) versus acquired (something the patient develops over time, either 
short or long term).  
2. Assess the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies paying special attention to the 
anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) as previously discussed in part three of this cours e. 
 
 
What to look for when assessing the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies of the lumbar 
spine. 
• Thin, vertical calcification along the ALL referred to as marginal 
syndesmophytes. This is usually associated with Ankylosing 
Spondylitis, (aka Marie Strumpell's disease, an inflammatory arthritis). 
In the early or  initial stage of the disease,  radiographically there may be 
local destruction of the rim of the vertebral body, which gives the 
appearance of a radiolucent erosion of the corner of the vertebra, 
known as Romanus lesion. This finding tends to decrease the concavity 
of the anterior vertebral body, giving it a squared appearance. 
Sometimes the reparative process can be rapid and cause the anterior 
vertebral body to become convex which is known as barre l-shaped 
vertebra. When this erosion of the corner of the vertebra heals, it 
becomes sclerotic and is known as shiny corner sign. These early 
radiographic findings are not easily seen. Late in the disease 
progression, the patient tends to have fusion of the posterior facets and 
IVD. Complications might then occur, like a fracture through the 
ankylosed vertebral column, (known as a carrot stick fracture) which 
tends to occur at the thoracolumbar and lower cervical spine. Another 
complication might be an Andersson lesion, which is the failure of the 
carrot stick fracture to reunite (reankylose). In addition, the patient may 
have a decreased lumbar lordosis. Complete fusion bilaterally of the 
sacroiliac joints occurs in 50% of the patients. The disease tends to 
initially start at the sacroiliac joints and ascend up the spine and skip to 
the thoracolumbar spine, costal articulations and cervical spine as 
previously mentioned in part three of this course under "cervical spine 
neutral lateral view." Also, in the lu mbar spine on the (AP lumbar 
view) if ossification occurs at the joint capsule, ligamentum flavum and 
interspinous ligaments (an appearance of three parallel opaque lines) 
will appear over the lumbar spine which is called trolley track sign. In 
addition, in the lumbar spine on the (AP lumbar view) if the 
interspinous and supraspinous ligaments ossify an appearance of one 
vertical opaque line will run over the lumbar spinous process called 
dagger sign. When women are affected with this disease, the 
radiographic findings are less severe, the sacroiliac joints are still 
involved, but there is little to no involvement of the spine.   Women 
tend to have involvement of the peripheral joints. Lab finding HLA -
B27 is positive in 90% of patients with ankylosing spondyl itis, ESR is 
increased in the active phase of the disease, CBC reveals mild anemia 
and RA factor is negative.  
• Large, flowing spurs along the ALL referred to as hyperostosis. These 
findings are usually associated with DISH (diffuse idiopathic skeletal 
hyper ostosis), aka Forestiers disease or Ankylosing hyperostosis. As 
previously discussed in part three of this course under "cervical spine 
neutral lateral view" radiographically, it does not affect the posterior 
 
 
facets or IVD (no fusion) and usually the disc spaces are maintained at 
three or more levels. More commonly, it seems to affect the upper three 
lumbar vertebrae. Sacroiliac joint involvement tends to be seen after 
the spine is already involved and ossification seems to involve the most 
superior and inferior aspect of the joint. Lab findings may demonstrate 
increased glucose levels (32% of patients diagnosed with DISH may 
have adult onset of diabetes mellitus). The patient may also have a 
positive HLA - B8, seen in approximately 40% of patients with DISH.  
• Lipping and spurring along the ALL (horizontal projections of bone 
coming off the anterior vertebral bodies and/or posterior vertebral 
bodies) and is referred to as spondylophytes, exostosis or 
osteophytes.  These  are usually associated with DJD, aka osteoarthritis, 
or wear and tear disease. Clinically it is typically more common in 
females, ages 50 and up. These patients tend to complain of pain and 
stiffness, with crepitus during movements of the joints. In addition, 
they may complain or present with swe lling of the joints. DJD is the 
most common form of arthritis. Weightbearing joints are usually 
affected. Vacuum sign (aka vacuum phenomenon) is an important early 
sign of DJD. Vacuum sign usually indicates degeneration of the disc 
and indicates that inter segmental motion is occurring. As a general rule 
with DJD, radiographically the joints are affected asymmetrically with 
nonuniform loss of joint space. Depending upon the stage of the 
arthritis, osteophytic formation, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral 
cysts, and degenerative subluxations can be present.. Lab findings with 
DJD are usually normal. The following findings of the spine are typical 
of DJD.  
Decreased disc space or height  
Subchondral sclerosis at vertebral endplates  
Lipping/spurring anterior and/or posterior vertebral body  
3. Assess the anterior vertebral bodies for chip fractures and limbus bone. Chip fracture 
can be caused by trauma and/or pulling of the ALL. Limbus bone is caused from 
migration and herniation of the nuclear material of the disc through a secondary growth 
center at the corner of the anterior vertebral body resulting in nonunion of the secondary 
growth center.  
4. Assess the vertebral bodies and disc spaces by looking for compression fractures, DJD, 
hemangiomas and any increased and/or decreased densities. If a compression fracture is 
suspected of the vertebral body, look to see if the anterior vertebral body is compressed 
vs. the posterior vertebral body. Try and differentiate between pathological vs. non- 
pathological. Once again, if the anterior vertebral body is compressed it is more likely 
from trauma and/or osteoporosis. If the posterior vertebral body is compressed, this is 
usually not a good sign and may indicate the possibility of some kind of osteolytic 
disease. When assessing for a hemangioma, look for coarse striations in the vertebral 
body separated by lucent areas between the coarse areas (referred to as corduroy cloth 
 
 
appearance). Most hemangiomas are located in the spine or skull and are considered the 
most common benign bone tumor of the spine. When located in the spine, hemangiomas 
are most commonly in the upper lumbar spine and lower thoracic spine. Hemangiomas 
are painless, benign bone tumors that do not become malignant.   Most are found in adults 
over 40 years of age and usually do not require any treatment. Continue looking at the 
lumbar bony structures, assessing for any density changes in the vertebrae. A decrease in 
density of the vertebral body may indicate possible lytic disease. An increase in density 
of the vertebral body may indicate some kind of blastic disease. In the case of an ivory 
(or opaque) vertebra,  consider the following possible causes: Hodgkin's Lymphoma, 
Paget's, Osteoblastic disease, possible degenerative sclerosis  and osteomyelitis (as 
previously discussed in parts four and seven of this course.  
Note:  Osteoblastic disease is the most common of these to cause an ivory vertebra.  
5. Assess the lumbar curve for hyper - or hypolordotic curve or sway back utilizing the 
Lumbar Lordosis Measurement, Lumbosacral Angle and Lumbar Gravity Line.  
Lumbar Lordosis Measurement  is done by drawing a line parallel to the superior 
endplate of L1 and the superior endplate of S1 or the inferior endplate of L5. Then, draw 
perpendicular lines from the parallel lines and measure the angle at their intersection. The 
normal measurement is between 50 and 60 degrees. An increase in the angle would 
indicate a hyperlordosis, whereas a decrease in the angle would indicate a hypolordosis.  
Lumbosacral Angle  is assessed by drawing a horizontal line parallel to the bottom edge 
of the film and placing it over the sacrum. Draw an oblique line through the parallel line 
across the sacral base. Measure the angle where the lines intersect at the posterior. The 
normal average lumbosacral angle in the upright position is 41 degrees, but can vary 
considerably with a minimum of 26 degrees and a maximum of 57 degrees. Significance 
of these findings can vary. An increased lumbosacral angle may be a mechanical factor in 
causing low back pain.  
Lumbar Gravity Line  is assessed by drawing diagonal lines from the corners of L3 
vertebral body.   Where they intersect at the center of L3, draw a vertical line from that 
point down to the sacrum. Assess this vertical line at the sacrum to see where on the 
sacrum it passes through. If the line passes anterior to the sacrum by more than 10mm, an 
increase lumbosacral angle may be occurring  
6. Assess the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies looking to see if there is any shifting 
of the vertebra above from the vertebra below i.e.; anteriolisthesis, retrolisthesis and 
spondylolisthesis. If you suspect a shifting of the vertebral body forward like in a 
spondylolisthesis, consider utilizing Meyerding's Grading Method. For purposes of this 
course, L5 -S1 level will be discussed, but one should recognize that this method can be 
applied to any other spinal level. To start, divide the base of the sacrum (sacral 
promontory) into four equal sections or grades, each one representing a 1/4. Ass ess the 
posterior inferior aspect of L5 vertebra to see if the vertebral body has shifted forward. 
Grade 1 indicates a 1/4 shift forward, Grade 2 indicates a 1/2 shift forward, Grade 3 
indicates 3/4 shift forward; Grade 4 indicates the vertebra has shifted  to the end of the 
sacral promontory. If there is complete shifting forward where the vertebra is completely 
 
 
off the sacral promontory, it is sometimes referred to as a Grade 5 spondylolisthesis or a 
spondyloptosis. 
Note:  When assessing L5 for spondylolist hesis, always look at the anterior aspect of the 
sacrum to see if there is any buttressing, which is calcification projecting out from the 
anterior aspect of the sacrum. This usually indicates a long -standing process and is one 
way that the body tries to protect/stabilize itself by building a bridge of calcium.  
Spondylolysis and/or Spondylolisthesis Clinical and Radiographic Significance:  
Definitions:  
Spondylolisthesis -indicates a break or separation at the vertebral arch (pars 
interarticularis) with forwar d displacement (slippage) of the vertebral body.  
Note:  Another term for describing this type of radiographic finding is known as 
spondylolytic spondylolisthesis.  
Spondylolysis -indicates a break or separation at the vertebral arch (pars interarticularis) 
without forward displacement (slippage) of the vertebral body.  
Note:  Another term for describing this type of radiographic finding is known as 
nonspondylolytic spondylolisthesis.  
Important facts to consider:  
• Approximately 90% of spondylolytic spondylolisthes es are at L5.  
• Approximately 10% are located at the lumbar spine (L1- L4) and the 
cervical spine.  
Note:  The cervical spine is a rare area in which to develop a 
spondylolisthesis, but when present C6 tends to be the most common 
level effected in the cervical spine. Most are asymptomatic, and the 
defect in the vertebral arch is almost always bilateral and found in 
males. Approximately 50% of patients with cervical spondylolysis have 
an associated spina bifida occulta of the involved vertebra. The most 
common cause of cervical spondyolisthesis is congenital agenesis or 
dysplasia of the pedicle.  
• Approximately 5- 7% are found in whites.  
• Athletes or very active people tend to have a higher incidence of 
spondylolysis 
Note:  Participation in sports is acceptable provided there is no 
biomechanical instability or neurological deficits.  
• Studies have shown that Alaskan Eskimos have a 40% higher 
prevalence of pars defects.  The reason for this may be that Eskimo 
infants are often carried in an upright posture  at an early age, thereby 
stressing the pars interarticularis.  
• Approximately 50% of patients with spondylolysis and/or 
spondylolisthesis are asymptomatic and do not develop back pain.  
 
 
• Patients can develop just a unilateral spondyloylsis, which causes a 
compensatory stress hypertrophy of the contralateral pars and pedicle, 
which may then mimic a neoplastic disorder like an osteoid osteoma, 
osteoblastoma or localized osteoblastic metastasis. One way to help 
make a differential diagnosis is to look for a unila teral pars defect on 
the side opposite the sclerotic pedicle.  
• Many times a patient with a spondylolisthesis of a grade three or more 
will reveal Napoleon's hat sign, which has the appearance of taking 
Napoleon's top hat and flipping it upside down. In addi tion, this usually 
has an appearance of an opacity (white curved line running from the 
top of the hat to the rim). If this appears, it is referred to as  bowline of 
Brailsford . This would only be seen on an AP view of the lumbar spine 
and is seen superimposed over the base/upper portion of the sacrum.  
• Patients you suspect to have a spondyloylsis (defect in the pars 
interarticularis) should be further evaluated with oblique films to assess 
the so called  Scotty Dog. If a pars defect is present on an oblique film, 
it would reveal a radiolucency at the neck of the Scotty Dog, 
representing a separation of the pars interarticularis which is considered 
a broken neck or collar  
Further evaluation can certainly be done by utilizing advance diagnostic imaging.   For 
example:   SPECT test (single -photon emission computed tomography) and/or MRI 
(magnetic resonance imaging).   These tests are critical when evaluating the physiological 
changes associated with spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis.   Of these two tests  the 
MRI tends to be the better choice because there is no radiation exposure to the patient and 
it provides better visualization of anatomical structure beyond just the pars 
interarticularis.   As long as the MRI is done with STIR (short -t-inversion recove ry) 
sequences it allows one to detect fat suppression thereby, detecting edema and assisting 
with determining if the condition is active versus an inactive state.  
Determining if the spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis is active or inactive would 
certain ly assist clinically in the management of the patient. Active indicates that there is 
activity associated with the pars defect and that the defect most likely will produce the 
patient to have symptoms. Inactive indicates that the patient may have symptoms,  but the 
cause of the symptoms is most likely not due to the pars defect but from another source. 
Patients with inactive spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis tend to have exacerbations 
of low back pain throughout their lives. In general, these patients s eem to do well with 
conservative treatment for managing their flare- ups and should be encouraged to continue 
with their conservative care provided they do not develop any neurological deficits.  
• Patients who do develop back pain tend to have another cause f or their 
symptoms i.e.; biomechanical or pathologic cause.  
• Progression of the spondylolisthesis (displacement) rarely occurs after 
the age of 18.  
• Physical examination findings may reveal a hyperlordosis of the 
lumbar spine, a palpable step defect, appearance of a heart -shaped 
 
 
buttock, and a clicking sensation at the involved level during forward 
flexion of the trunk or straight leg raising. The patient may also have 
unexplained hamstring tightness.  
Six Classifications of Spondylolisthesis:  
• Congenital—born w ith a defect in the vertebral arch (pars interarticularis)  
• Isthmic defect —caused by stress, elongation of pars or acute fracture. Isthmic 
defect specifically from a stress fracture is considered the number one cause of 
pars defects.  
• Degenerative—wearing down of the facets from DJD causing an anterior 
translation. Degenerative spondylolisthesis is most common at L4, more 
common in females over the age of 40 and is seen three times more in blacks 
than whites. In addition, degenerative spondylolisthesis is four times more 
likely to be seen with a sacralization of L5 vertebra.  
• Traumatic —caused from direct trauma 
• Pathologic—caused from pathology some kind of disease of the bone  
• Iatrogenic—caused secondary to spinal surgery 
Management and Prognosis:  
• Conservative treatment is recommended over surgery unless the patient has an 
unstable spondylolisthesis or neurocompressive radiculopathy. In the absence 
of an unstable spondylolisthesis and/or neurocompressive radiculopathy, the 
doctor and patient should exhaust all conservative measures first prior to 
considering any surgical correction. Treatment management should also be 
based upon determining if the spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis is in the 
active vs. inactive phase.  
Special Note:  If the patient  has an active spondylolysis and/or 
spondylolisthesis, it is recommended that the patient wear a brace known as 
a Boston overlap (antilordotic brace). This brace is usually worn periodically 
for a couple of weeks and then for approximately four months for 23 hours a 
day so the pars defect can attempt to heal. The patient can slowly start 
exercising while wearing the brace beginning with light stretching of the 
hamstrings and slowly adding abdominal and lumbar flexion exercises as 
improvement is seen and he or she is no longer in the acute stages. During 
abdominal and lumbar flexion exercises, the patient does not have to wear the 
brace. It should be noted that this protocol is usually very successful for 
healing of the pars defect.  
Note:  If the patient is in  an inactive and/or chronic phase, conservative 
treatment is usually beneficial and may include possible lifestyle changes 
(restriction and/or limited activity depending upon the cause of the patient's 
pain). Strengthening exercises for the abdominal and l ower back muscles, 
nonnarcotic analgesics and chiropractic spinal manipulation (i.e.; side posture, 
Cox flexion/distraction and lumbosacral stretch).   Choice of manipulation 
should be determined by doctor preference and patient tolerance.  
 
 
Note:  The reason for spinal manipulation is because many times patients who 
present with a spondylolisthesis seem to have other conditions that are really 
the cause of their back pain i.e.; hyperlordosis, facet syndrome and/or 
sacroiliac fixation.  
7.  Assess the posterior elements of the lumbar spine -look for all normal anatomy 
pedicles, superior and inferior facets (aka zygapophysis), TVP's, lamina and spinous 
processes and evaluate for any abnormalities. After assessing the lumbar spine, look at 
the ilium/iliac crests, sa crum, and coccyx (if visualized) and evaluate for any 
abnormalities.  
8. Assess any soft tissue structures that are visible. Specifically look anterior to the 
lumbar vertebra for any calcification of the abdominal aorta. If calcification is visualized, 
one must assess for any dilatation of the vessel. If the abdominal aorta measures 3.8cm at 
its most distant calcified borders consider a high probability of an abdominal aortic 
aneurysm triple A (AAA). Because of the close relationship of the aorta and the ant erior 
portion of the vertebrae, evaluation of the anterior vertebral bodies should be assessed for 
any vertebral body erosions known as Oppenheimer erosions, which can occur within a 
two-year period and are present in approximately 5% of AAA. Abdominal aor tic 
aneurysms are more common in males at a 5 to 1 ratio. Most patients (40%) with AAA 
have hypertension, and 30% have heart disease. Most AAA start 1- 2cm below the renal 
arteries infrarenal and 90 -95% of the aneurysms are atherosclerotic. Many times the 
patient is asymptomatic, but if symptoms do occur, they are usually intermittent 
abdominal and low back pain. Often times, aneurysms are detected on plain film x- rays if 
calcification of the vessel is present. Calcification is usually present in 55 -85% of 
aneurysms. Aneurysms can rupture —7cm or larger there is a 75% chance of rupture, 6cm 
15% chance of rupture and 5cm there is less than a 5% chance of rupture. Patients with 
aneurysms 5cm or larger usually undergo elective surgery. Below 5cm the patient is 
monitored every four to six months by physical examination (palpation and auscultation) 
as well as diagnostic ultrasound. Palpation of the abdomen should be done in order 
toassess the abdominal aorta for a bounding pulse or any enlargement of the vessel. If the 
dilation of the vessel exceeds the midclavicular line, this usually indicates an enlarged 
vessel (dilation).  
In addition, the doctor can assess the peripheral pulses of the lower extremities (iliac, 
femoral, popliteal, posterior tibialis and dorsal ped is) for any loss of strength (amplitude) 
comparing bilaterally. Auscultation is helpful over the abdominal aorta and renal arteries 
listening for any bruits. If an aneurysm ruptures, it usually results in death. Laboratory 
testing is helpful for managing A AA. If the ESR is elevated it may indicate an 
inflammatory aneurysm. Elevated creatinine could indicate kidney disease, and low 
hemoglobin may indicate anemia because of blood loss. Certainly, if the chiropractic 
physician suspects and/or detects an AAA, spinal manipulation and/or physiotherapy is 
contraindicated and the patient should be referred immediately to a vascular specialist for 
further evaluation/consultation and/or surgical repair.  
 
 
 
 
X-RAY SCAN LUMBAR SPINE AND PELVIS (AP VIEWS):  
 
LUMBAR SPINE (AP VIEW) AND PELVIS (AP VIEW):  
Note: The x -ray scan for the AP lumbar spine and AP pelvis will be assessed together.  
Give it your first impression —normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the patient 
is born with) versus acquired (something the patient  develops over time, either short or 
long term).  
Assess the SI (sacroiliac joint) looking at the lower 1/3 of SI joint for any 
abnormal findings i.e.; fusion, sclerosis, erosion, widening and/or destruction. 
Consider the following possible causes:  
AS (ankylosing spondylitis) -symmetrical bilateral fusion of SI joint. Seen in 
males 15 -35 years old. Symptomatology is usually stiffness of axial skeleton. 
Blood work HLA - B27 is positive, ESR is increased, mild anemia is present 
and RA factor is negative.  
DJD (de generative joint disease aka osteoarthritis or wear and tear 
disease) - unilateral and/or bilateral asymmetrical sclerosis of the lower 1/3 
of the SI joint (seen on both the ilium and sacrum) and narrowing of joint 
space is common. Symptomatology is usually pain, stiffness, crepitus, 
swelling and deformity of joints. Blood work is negative.  
Osteitis condensi illi- bilateral symmetric sclerosis on the ilium not on the 
sacrum. Seen in women 20 -40 years old and multiparous. 
Symptomatology varies —patients may have loss of or excessive sacroiliac 
joint motion and possible referred pain into the lower extremity and groin. 
This condition is self -limiting. Blood work is negative.  
A. RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) -unilateral erosion of SI joint, no sclerosis; 
fusion is rare. Can be seen in males or females in the range of 20 -60 years 
old, but is more common at the age of 40- 50. Signs and symptoms vary. 
Patient may have a low -grade fever, fatigue, weight loss, muscle soreness 
and atrophy. Symmetric peripheral joint pain and swelling especially in 
the hands and feet. Laboratory findings reveal RA latex positive in 70% of 
the cases, elevated ESR and anemia.  
Psoriatic -bilateral asymmetric erosion of SI joints; fusion is rare. Seen in 
patients 20- 50 years old. Skin lesions are  common—dry, raised, red and 
silvery scaly patches. Changes of the nails is common in 80% of arthritis 
patients (pitting, ridging, discoloration, loss of the nail or a thickening of 
the skin under the nail tip). Lab findings reveal negative ESR unless the 
patient is in the acute phase, RA latex is negative, HLA -B27 is positive in 
75% of patients who have sacroiliac joint involvement and positive 30% 
of the time in patients who have peripheral joint involvement.  
Reiter's -unilateral erosion of SI joint more c ommon in the early stages; 
can be bilateral either symmetric and/or asymmetric and fusion is rare. 
Affects males more than females in a 50 to 1 ratio and usually seen 
 
 
between the ages of 18 -40. This arthritis tends to affect the lower 
extremities, primarily the foot. Laboratory findings reveal HLA -B27 
positive in 75% of the patients. Patients may also develop a triad 
following sexual intercourse (urethritis, conjunctivitis and polyarthritis).  
Enteropathic arthritis -bilateral fusion of SI joint (symmetric) u sually seen 
in young adults; findings almost identical to AS usually cause d by a 
gastrointestinal disease most common ulcerative colitis and regional 
enteritis (Crohn's disease). Laboratory findings will reveal a positive 
HLA -B27 in 10- 12% of the patients and RA factor is negative.  
Hyperparathyroidism- bilateral widening of SI joint (symmetric), females 
more affected 30 -50 years old. Patients have an increase in parathyroid 
activity, which causes an osteoclastic effect on the bone. Laboratory 
findings reveal  an elevated alkaline phosphatase and parathoromone.  
Infection -does not usually affect SI joints, but if it does it is unilateral and 
crosses the joint space and destroys the joint. Many times the first sign of 
an infection is soft tissue swelling i.e.; ed ema, obliteration and/or elevated 
fat planes and increased density changes in soft tissue. Most common 
cause is  Staphylococcus aureus . Laboratory findings may reveal elevated 
white blood cells and increase in the ESR, most likely indicating an 
infection. S ymptomatology can vary depending upon the age of the 
individual and stage of the infection. Fever and swelling are typical 
symptoms. If an infection is suspected, the patient should be referred for 
medical intervention (antibiotics). Prognosis is usually g ood if diagnosed 
early.  
Special Note:  When assessing the sacroiliac joint, keep in mind that the 
posterior sacroiliac joint is located medial and the anterior joint is located 
lateral. In addition, the sacroiliac joint in children usually appears ill-
defin ed and widened  
After assessing the sacroiliac joints, continue assessing the pelvis 
i.e.; ilium, sacrum, coccyx and hips. Look at the periosteum for any 
periosteal reactions, cortex for any fractures, thickening or thinning 
of cortex and medullary portion of the bone (trabeculation) for any 
coarsened or thinning trabecular patterns and any increased and/or 
decreased densities. If there is increased trabecular pattern with 
thickening of the cortex, consider Paget's disease. If there is 
decreased trabecular p attern with thinning of the cortex, consider 
possible osteoporosis. In cases of increased density, consider 
possible blastic reaction like Paget's or blastic metastasis. In cases of 
decreased density, consider possible lytic reaction like a lytic 
metastasi s, Multiple Myleoma or osteomyelitis (infection).  
Note:  Whenever possible, always compare structures bilaterally looking for any 
differences from side to side, which may indicate pathology. Always consider the 
patient's history and past medical history, pa ying specific attention to any recent or 
 
 
old trauma/falls. In addition, consider the patient's family history, age and sex, 
which  may help rule in or out many osseous disorders  
Assess the acetabulum i.e.: acetabular rim, inferior acetabular fossa (aka Kohl er's 
teardrop) and femoral head, neck, and greater and lesser trochanter. When assessing the 
hips, look at the acetabulum, femoral head and neck for the following:  
Protrusio Acetabuli - protrusion of the head of the femur into the medial 
aspect of the acetabulum usually associated with the following:  
RA (Rheumatoid arthritis) -most common cause, usually seen 
bilaterally with uniform loss of the joint space. When seen 
bilaterally, it is referred to as  Otto's pelvis . 
Trauma- cause acetabular fracture seen unilat eral 
Arthritis -most often from RA. When caused by DJD, it is 
usually unilateral with nonuniform loss of the joint space, 
osteophytic formation at the outer supraacetabular margin 
and lateral and inferomedial surfaces of the femoral head. 
Subchondral bone cysts are usually present. Buttressing 
/thickening of the cortex is possible at the medial aspect 
of the femoral neck and joint deformity or flattening of 
the femoral head at its superior aspect.  
Fractures of the proximal femur- (classified  as 
Intracapsular and Extracapsular)  Intracapsular -are 
considered fractures inside the joint capsule and consist 
of the following:  
Subcapital - most common . Two types -impacted or 
displaced. When considering the possibility of a 
subcapital (impacted) fracture, one should look closely 
because they are difficult to detect especially if there is 
no displacement.  
Midcervical -uncommon 
Basicervical -uncommon 
 
Note:  Nonunion and avascular necrosis are complications 
that can arise with intra -capsular fractures:  
Extracapsular -are considered fractures outside the joint capsule and consist of the 
following: 
• Intertrochanteric- usually seen between the greater and lesser tro chanter; could 
be right through both the greater and lesser trochanter, giving rise to two 
fragments.  
 
 
• Trochanteric- greater trochanter fractures usually caused by a fall and are seen 
in elderly patients whereas lesser trochanter fractures are usually seen i n 
children or adolescent athletes. Lesser trochanteric fractures when seen in 
adults are usually caused from a pathology like a secondary metastatic lesion.  
• Subtrochanteric- usually associated with pathologic diseases like Paget's and 
metastatic lesions in the proximal femur.  
Note: As a general rule, proximal femoral fractures are not that common in 
young and middle -aged patients as compared to geriatric patients. The risk of 
developing a proximal femoral fracture increases with age. There are certain 
conditi ons that also increase the likelihood of a proximal femoral fracture i.e.; 
Paget's disease, fibrous dysplasia, malignant/benign bone tumors, osteoporosis, 
osteomalacia, osteonecrosis radiation -induced etc. There is also a high incident 
of death because of proximal femoral fractures in geriatric patients because of 
pulmonary and/or cardiac complications.  
Dislocation of hip -two types  
 Anterior- less common than posterior dislocation, femoral head is 
usually dislocated inferior, medial to the acetabulum because of a 
force from abduction and extension of the femur.  
 Posterior- most common type, femoral head is usually 
dislocated completely out of the acetabulum. Cause 
usually from severe trauma hip is in a flexed and 
abducted position i.e.; motor vehicle accident (M VA).  
Note:  Complications of a hip dislocation can be 
degenerative arthritis, myositis ossificans, avascular 
necrosis and sciatic paralysis.  
Legg Calve's Perthe's (aka Avascular Necrosis) -femoral capital epiphysis develops 
necrosis before closure of the growth plate.   Early detection of the disease is 
accomplished by performing plain film x- rays as well as MRI to help evaluate the 
articular cartilage. Radioigraphically, the joint space at the medial aspect of the hip tends 
to be increased, and the femoral head is displaced laterally known as Waldenstrom's sign. 
Femoral head may appear small and there may be a lucency noted at the femoral head, 
which  is known as crescent sign (aka rim sign).  There also may be sclerosis of the 
epiphysis which is known as snowcap appearance.  
Later in the disease, deformity can occur causing the femoral neck 
to be short and the femoral head enlarged which is known as coxa 
magna or the femoral head to be fattened known as coax plana or 
mushroom deformity. The disease is considered self -limiting within 
2-8 years. The problem with Legg Calve's Perthe's disease is 
development of deformity. This disease affects those between the 
ages of 3 and 12. Males are affected mo re than females in a 5 to1 
ratio. Patient may complain of groin pain and present with a limp. In 
long standing Legg Calve's Perthe's disease, the patient may develop 
degenerative arthritic changes of the hip, painful and decreased 
 
 
ROM, possible muscle atro phy and a short leg. The patient may also 
complain of stiffness which improves upon walking. Prognosis of 
the disease has to do with age, sex, radiographic findings and time 
of diagnosis. Treatment (if found early) is usually surgery to prevent 
lateral dis placement of the hip and encourage healing of the 
cartilage and femoral head. If found later in the disease, hip 
replacement is possible.t.  
Slipped Femoral Capital Epiphysis -considered the most common hip disorder of the 
adolescent . Femoral head remains in  the acetabulum while the femoral neck slips 
superior on the femoral head. Radiographically, there may be widening of the growth 
plate, reduction in the epiphyseal height, medial periosteal buttressing at the femoral neck 
and abnormal Klein's line. Klein's  line is a line drawn on the AP pelvis/hip view at the 
superior lateral aspect of the femoral neck. The lateral aspect of the femoral head 
(epiphysis) is evaluated to see if it passes through the line. If the epiphysis lies medial to 
the line, it indicates  an abnormal finding and strongly indicates slipped femoral capital 
epiphysis. This disorder affects males more than females, blacks more than whites, and 
individuals 10- 15 years old. The condition tends to be unilateral more than bilateral. The 
classic pr esentation is seen in an obese adolescent with a limp who has hip pain which 
may radiate into the knee. If the slippage is severe, the patient usually has a positive 
Trendelenburgs test indicating a weak gluteus medius. If seen bilateral, the patient may 
present with a waddling gait. Radiographic evaluation should always include an AP 
pelvis/hip and frog- leg projection. There are complications of slipped femoral capital 
epiphysis if left untreated i.e.; coxa vara deformity, abnormal development of the femor al 
neck, possible avascular deformity and the most common complication—degenerative 
joint disease. Treatment usually consists of surgical repair with pins to prevent further 
slippage. 
Note:  Shenton's line may also be used to assess for the possibility of 
slipped femoral capital epiphysis, hip dislocation or femoral neck 
fracture. A smooth curved line is drawn from the inferior portion of 
the femoral neck to the superior pubic ramus (superior border of the 
obturator foramen) a break in the line would indicat e a positive 
finding. 
Congenital Hip Dysplasia- deformity of the acetabulum resulting in dislocation of the 
femur from the deformed acetabulum. Radiographically, there is an absent or small 
proximal femoral epiphysis. There is displacement laterally of the femur and a shallow 
acetabular roof. If all three radiographic findings are present, it is known as Putti's triad.  
 
Note:  In addition, always assess any part of the shaft of the femur 
that is visible, looking for any periosteal reactions, fractures of the 
cortex, thickening or thinning of cortex, medullary portion of the 
bone (trabeculation) for any coarsened or thinning trabecular 
patterns and any increased and/or decreased densities (aka 
lucency/opacities) as well as any deformities  
 
 
After assessing the pe lvis/hips continue assessing L5- S1 region 
(lumbosacral spine) looking for the following:  
Transitional vertebra - Two types  
A. Sacralization -is when L5 takes on the characteristics of the sacrum  
B. Lumbarization - when S1 takes on the characteristics of the lumbar 
spine 
Note:  Transitional vertebrae are not always completely developed, 
but can be partially developed either bilateral or unilateral and can 
form accessory joints between the lumbosacral junction (what is 
referred to as a false joint or pseudo joint). In addition, a 
transitional vertebra, which causes a scoliosis and the patient to 
experience sciatica, is referred to as  Bertolotti's syndrome . 
Facet tropism —asymmetrical facets located in different planes, usually 
one in the sagittal plane and one in the coronal plane. The most common 
area affected is the lumboscaral spine. The clinical significance of this 
finding is debatable as to whether or not it causes lower back pain.  
Spina bifida occulta —normal variant. This is failure of the fusion of the 
lamina to f orm the spinous process. No clinical significance.  
Knife Clasp syndrome —a normal variant located at L5 -S1. The L5 
spinous process is enlarged and elongated pointing in the caudad direction 
and S1 reveals a spina bifida occulta. This syndrome is usually pai nful 
upon extension manuevers. Conservative treatment should be focused on 
avoiding extension maneuvers and not contacting the L5 spinous process. 
The patient should be encouraged to do flexion type exercises to help 
strengthen, tone and stretch the muscul ature, ligaments and fascia over the 
lumbosacral spine. If conservative care is not successful, surgical removal 
of the elongated spinous process is an option.  
Spondylolysis and/or Spondylolisthesis -look for a pars interarticulars 
defect, usually a linear oblique lucency located inferior to the pedicles. In 
addition, assess for an inverted Napoleon's Hat sign seen with a grade 3 or 
more spondylolisthesis and the appearance of bowline of Brailsford as 
discussed previously in part nine of this course under "S pondylolisthesis 
Clinical and Radiographic Significance."  
Assess all bony structures of the lumbar spine i.e.; vertebrae, 
pedicles, lamina, spinous processes, superior and inferior facets (aka 
zygoapophysis) and TVP's. Evaluate for any abnormalities and/or  
congenital anomalies, scoliosis, vertebral compression fractures and 
fractures in general. Also, assess any missing pedicles, hypertrophy 
of pedicles (as previously mentioned in part seven of this course 
under "AP Thoracic View") and assess any failure of  fusion of 
lamina, spina bifida occulta as previously mentioned in part eight of 
this course under "AP Thoracic Spine."  In addition, look for any 
 
 
lumbar ribs or hypoplastic ribs of the lower thoracic spine and 
costochondral cartilage calcification.  
Assess all soft tissue structures looking for any calcification, enlargement 
and/or displacement i.e.;  
A. Calcification and/or dilatation of abdominal aorta -usually located on 
the left side of the spine  
B. Calcification of common iliac -usually located over the s acrum 
region 
C. Calcified lymph nodes i.e.; peripheral mesenteric lymph nodes often 
seen after a previous infection and are the most common abdominal 
lymph nodes to calcify  
D. Calcified thrombus within a vein known as phleboliths considered 
the most common calcification in the pelvis, usually multiple and 
bilateral, asymptomatic and of no clinical significance  
E. Calcification of uterine fibroids -seen in females in pelvic basin  
F. Calcification of ovarian tumors which can be seen in benign and 
malignant tumors of the o varies  
G. Calcification of the prostate -seen in males usually over the age of 40 
caused from renal calculi or prostatitis and seen lying over the pubic 
area 
H. Calcification of the vas deferens -seen in long standing diabetes and 
usually found in men located over  the superior aspect of the pubic 
rami 
I. Calcification in the gluteal region -usually from injection sites in the 
subcutaneous and intramuscular area  
Note:  Many of these calcifications are benign in nature, but if there 
is any clinical concern, additional diagnostic testing should be 
performed to rule out the possibilities of any pathology. In addition, 
all gas shadows (lucency) should be fully evaluated espe cially when 
overlying areas of bone in order to rule out the possibility of an 
osteolytic/metastatic disease.

GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 
Nervous System Development 
There is robust growth of the human brain in the first two years 
of life, driven mainly by gray matter growth. In contrast, white 
matter growth was much slower. 
Particularly the period from birth to 2, may be the most 
dynamic and important phase of postnatal brain development 
in humans. This period is likely to be critical in 
neurodevelopmental disorders. 
Pediatric growth patterns suggest the structural underpinnings 
of cognitive and motor development in early childhood, as well 
as the potential pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 3Nervous System Development 
There is a dramatic increase in overall brain size during this 
period, with the brain reaching 80–90% of adult volume by age 
2 (Pfefferbaumet al., 1994). 
The rapid elaboration of new synapses in the first two years of 
life (Huttenlocherand Dabholkar, 1997; Glantzet al., 2007) 
corresponds with an increase in overall gray matter volumes to 
a lifetime maximum around age 2 (Hu ̈ppiet al., 1998; 
Matsuzawa et al., 2001; Gilmore et al., 2007b). 
Myelination of white matter proceeds rapidly after birth 90% in 
the first 2 years. 
Nervous System Development 
Premature and Postmature(arrive 2 or more weeks after due 
date) babies are at greater risk of complications like sickness, 
brain damage, and death, than Full-term babies.  
Lower/sub cortical brain areas (govern basic life functions, like 
breathing) are first to develop, followed by higher/cortical areas 
(thinking and planning). 
Birth trauma, low birth weight and early sickness can affect later 
physical and mental health.
Because most brain changes occur prenatal and soon after 
birth, early intervention is critical to making changes to 
influence optimal neurological development .  
Nervous System Development 
The general pattern of adult myelination is present by the end 
of the second year (Sampaioand Truwit, 2001), although 
myelination does continue, at a slower rate, far into adulthood. 
Concurrent with the rapid pace of structural brain development 
is an equally rapid development of a wide range of cognitive 
and motor functions (Kaganand Herschkowitz, 2005). 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 4Nervous System Development 
The large increase in total brain volume in the first year of 
life suggests that this is a critical period in which disruption 
of developmental processes, as the result of innate genetic 
abnormalities or as a consequence of environmental 
insults, may have long-lasting or permanent effects on brain 
structure and function. 
This fact suggests that there is a pressing clinical need to 
identify children at risk for developmental disorders within 
the first year of life and to initiate appropriate 
interventions. 
Nervous System Development 
Major Bertrand Dejarnette, DC
Subluxations of the atlas-occipital region or atlas-axis area will cause 
the primary respiratory mechanism to distort and cause abnormal 
stress of the meningeal system... It is important to note that almost 
all of these subluxations, especially in the upper cervical region occur 
before the seventh year of life. 
The subluxation produces abnormal stimulus which affects the 
musculoskeletal system and can alter the total make-up of the 
intervertebral foramen through the total length of the vertebral 
system. This stimulus is not necessarily one resulting from a changed 
attitude of one vertebrae in relationship to another or many other 
vertebrae, but may be the result of meningeal bulging, traction, 
overlapping, tearing, inflammation of one of many other processes. 
The total dural structure is under tension with resultant neurological 
dysfunction develops at the spinal or cranial area now under the 
greatest stress. 
Nervous System Development 
Because the cerebellum is critically involved in motor 
coordination and balance (Bastian and Thach, 2002), the striking 
cerebellar growth may underpin the rapid motor developments 
of infancy (pre-programed proprioceptive feedback loops). 
The cerebellum has also been implicated in a plethora of other 
cognitive abilities including planning, set-shifting, language 
abilities, abstract reasoning, working memory, and visual-spatial 
organization (Schmahmannand Sherman, 1998). 
Given that “cognitive” regions of the cerebellum have 
reciprocal projections with nonprimaryfrontal, parietal, and 
occipital association cortex (Thach, 1996), the extremely rapid 
growth of the cerebellum in the first year may be a prerequisite 
for specific aspects of later cortical development. 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 5“Traumatization of the suboccipital 
structures inhibits functioning of the 
proprioceptive feedback loops. The 
motor development, though 
preprogrammed, cannot develop 
normally. These systems are fault 
tolerant and able to overcome 
considerable difficulties and restricted 
working conditions. But the price for 
this is a reduced capacity to absorb 
additional stress later. These children 
may show only minor symptoms in the 
first months of their life but later on at 
the age of 5 or 6 they suffer from 
headaches, postural problems or 
diffuse symptoms like sleep disorders, 
being unable to concentrate etc.”

ICPA 6Current Research
Context: Recent evidence suggests that osteopathic manipulative treatment 
of somatic dysfunction in newborns may decrease complications and 
hospital length of stay. Such dysfunction may result from external forces 
related to the birth process, but its incidence is unknown. 
Objective: To identify the incidence and patterns of somatic dysfunction in 
healthy newborns at least 6 hours after birth and to correlate those findings 
with maternal and labor history, gestational age, and findings of the initial 
newborn assessment performed immediately after birth. 
Methods: Healthy newborns aged 6 to 72 hours were physically examined 
and assessed for somatic dysfunction, including asymmetry and motion 
restriction of the cranial, cervical, lumbar, and sacral regions. The total 
somatic dysfunction identified was summarized in a somatic dysfunction 
severity score (SDSS), calculated by assigning 1 point for each identified 
finding; the SDSS could range from 0 (no somatic dysfunction) to 34 (all 
somatic dysfunctions assessed present). Findings were correlated with 
maternal and newborn characteristics and labor history. Descriptive 
analyses were performed, and findings were compared between the initial 
newborn assessment and the research examination. 
Current Research
Results: One hundred newborns were examined (mean gestational 
age, 38.5 weeks). In 99 newborns (99%), at least 1 sphenobasilar 
synchondrosis strain pattern was present, with sidebending rotations 
being the most common (present in 63 newborns [63%]). Condylar 
compression was found in 95 newborns (95%), temporal bone 
restrictions in 85 (85%), motion restriction of at least 1 cervical 
vertebral segment in 91 (91%) and at least 1 lumbar vertebral 
segment in 94 (94%), and a posterior sacral base in 80 (80%). The 
SDSS was not associated with mode of delivery or labor 
augmentation (P=.49 and P=.54, respectively), but it was positively 
associated with the duration of labor; each 1-hour increase in labor 
increased the predicted SDSS by 0.12 points (P=.04). 
Conclusion: Somatic dysfunction of the cranial, cervical, lumbar, and 
sacral regions was common in healthy newborns, and the total 
somatic dysfunction (SDSS) was related to the length of labor.

ICPA 7Primary and Secondary Curves of the Spine 
The primary curve (kyphosis) occurs in utero as the sclerotome
develops in the 4 week old embryo. 
The first secondary curve (cervical lordosis) begins to form 
between the 3rdand 4thmonth after birth when the infant is able 
to hold its head in an erect position and reaches completion 
around 9 months when the infant can sit upright.
The second secondary curve (lumbar lordosis) occurs between 
the ages of 12 and 18 months during the transition from crawling 
to walking.
Primary and Secondary Curves of the Spine 
The erect infant, when weight bearing, will 
have one primary curve and two secondary 
curves. 
The primary thoracic spine forms the 
reciprocating kyphoticcurve with the 
sacrum. 
The cervical and lumbar lordoticcurves 
form as compensatory reactions to erect 
posture. 
The lumbar curve is more pronounced in 
the female. 
PrimarySecondary
Dural Meningeal System 
At birth all cranial bones are 
enveloped in a periosteal sac that 
are separated from one another by 
connective tissue that become the 
sutures. 
There are two cranial layers of dura 
–meningeal and periosteal 
(endosteal) which form the basic 
reciprocal membranes and create 
the cranial duct system. 
These attach and are part of the 
entire dural meningeal system 
starting from the filumterminale. 
The dural meningeal system is one 
contiguous structure. 

MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 8Structural Effects of the Vertebral 
Subluxation Complex 
In the early 1980’s Dr. Burl Pettibonshowed that 
piezoelectric currents are formed when spinal 
vertebrae are under abnormal stress. 
His research regarding scoliosis revealed that in a 
scoliosis or spinal imbalance the concavity (due 
increased structural pressure) sets up a negative 
ionic charge, therefore attracting the positive 
calcium ion to that side and increasing calcification 
and intra-articular pressure on the disc. 
At the same time at the convexity of the curvature a 
positive charge is set up reducing the number of 
calcium ions attracted to this side. This effectively 
contributes to bone loss at this point.
+-
Piezoelectric Influences on Bone
These electric charges affect the degeneration process by 
abnormally altering the ionic balance of the vertebral 
segments under stress causing abnormal bone loss and 
increased calcification (spurring). 
In an uncorrected or unbalanced spine the degenerative 
process will continue and a heightened rate and increasing 
through adolescence and adulthood. 
Mechanical Factors 
Gravitational forces can affect osteoblasticto osteoclastic
developmental ratios. 
The number and activity of osteoclasts must be tightly 
regulated. If there are too many active osteoclasts, too much 
bone will be dissolved, and with resultant osteoporosis.
Conversely, if not enough osteoblasts are produced, the 
bones are not hollowed out for the marrow, and 
osteopetrosis results.

Spinal Dura Mater:  Loose sheath around the spinal cord it attaches 
to the meningeal layer of the cranial dura 
Its outer layer passes through the foramen magnum and becomes 
the periosteum of the inner layer of the vertebrae. Its epidural space 
–between the spinal dura and vertebral canal –contains loose
areolar tissue and a plexus of veins that correspond in position with 
the cranial dural sinuses. 
It is attached to the circumference of the foramen magnum, the 
second and third cervical vertebrae and the posterior longitudinal 
ligament. 
The cavity of the tube ends at the 2nd sacral segment the attaches 
to the filumterminaleand finally to the periosteum at the back of

ICPA 13NEURAL TISSUE DYNAMICS
“There is a normal natural dynamic tension which is 
present in the function of the neural tissues within 
the brain and spinal cord.
These tensions are maintained through positions and 
connections existing in and around the neural 
substance via the piamater and dura mater”

CSF movement
PiaMater –Neural Continuity (Epineurium) 
Can create abnormal tension on the nerve sheath affecting

ICPA 14Dural Meningeal Influences 
Abnormal dural tensions interfere with normal cranial 
bone motion and with free blood flow through this 
venous sinus system. 
“Interference with the venous sinus drainage may result 
in increased intracranial venous back pressure which will 
then reduce normal fresh blood delivery to the brain. It 
may also raise CSF pressure...... thereby interfere with the 
normal movement of this vital fluid through the 
ventricular system of the brain......”

Sacral Dural Attachments
Trolard’s Ligaments in Anterior Sacral region 
anchor into the spinal dura.
Ligaments of Hofmann Along the Posterior 
Longitudinal Ligament in the thoracic and 
lumbar regions have attachment to the spinal

The sacral dura ends within the sacral canal at 
the level of S2 attaching firmly to the 
periosteum.
Along with the periosteal attachments, the 
ligaments of Trolardand Hoffman help anchor 
the dura in the lumbosacral region.
Cranial Sutures and Dural Membranes 
The dura connects to the inner periosteal membrane of the 
skull and passes through the sutures to form the outer 
periosteum of the cranium. 
“The suturalconnective tissue along with the other types of 
connective tissue, penetrate the approximated edges of the 
bone. The connective tissue also extends inward to the dura 
and outward through the periosteum to the inner layer of the 
scalp. Accordingly, movement of the scalp and/or cranial 
bones would be reflected in the dura and vasculature.”

ICPA 16Dura Matter 
The cranial dura mater is the tough outermost layer of 
meninges that surround the brain. It is split into two layers: 
the outer layer adheres to the inner surface of the skull and 
is known as the periosteal layer and the inner layer is 
reflected as sheet-like protrusions into the cranial cavity 
and is known as the meningeal layer. 
The cranial dura mater forms four dural reflections: 
Falx Cerebri, Tentorium Cerebelli, Falx Cerebelli., 
Diaphragma Sellae . 
Dural venous sinuses form at the dural reflections and drain 
blood and cerebrospinal fluid from the brain into the 
internal jugular vein. 
Cranial Dural Membranes 
Falx Cerebri 
Sickle shaped double layer of the duramater, 
lying between the cerebral hemispheres. 
Attached anteriorly to the crista galliand 
posteriorly to the tentorium cerebelli. 
It’s free inferior concave border contains the 
inferior sagittal sinus, and its upper convex 
margin encloses the superior sagittal sinus 
Falx Cerebelli 
Small sickle shaped projection between the 
cerebellar hemispheres. 
Attached posteriorly and inferiorly to part of 
the tentorium 
Contains the occipital sinus in its posterior 
border 
Cranial Dural Membranes 
Tentorium Cerebelli 
An arched lamina elevated in the middle and 
Inclining downward toward the circumference 
Covers the superior surface of the 
cerebellum and supports the occipital lobes of 
the brain 
Its anterior border is free and concave, and 
bounds the opening for the tentorial incisure
(transmission of the cerebral peduncles) 
Attached posteriorly to the transverse ridges 
of the occiput and in front to the superior 
angle of the petrous portion of the temporal 
bone 
At the apex the free and attached borders 
meet and attach to the anterior and posterior 
clinoidprocesses.

Dural Pia Connection
The Dentate Ligament
Between each spinal nerve 
bilaterally there is a meningeal 
bridge between the spinal pia
and dura mater called the 
Dentate Ligament.
The piamater cannot be 
separated from the neural 
substance so dural tension can be 
dynamically transmitted to the 
spine and ultimately the brain 
and related neural tissue.

CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 19Central Canal
The lateral ventricles are located 
deep in the cerebral hemispheres 
and continue to the 3rdventricle 
between the right and left thalami 
continuing to the 4thventricle in the 
midbrain.
The 4thventricle continues on the 
posterior aspect of the pons and 
medulla passing caudally to the 
narrow central canal of the spinal 
cordextending into the upper 
centimeters of the filumterminale.
CSF Circulation
CSF produced by the Choroid Plexus 
and passes to the two lateral 
ventricles.
CSF continues from each lateral 
ventricle to the 3rdventricle and 
then to the 4thventricle.
From the 4th ventricle the fluid 
continues to circulate through the 
craniospinalsubarachnoid space all 
the way to the lumbosacral cistern.
Craniosacral Motion
CSF flows headward from the 
Lumbosacral Cistern by way of 
the “pumping action” caused by 
sacral nutation.
Sacral nutationresponds to 
respiratory diaphragm breathing, 
occurs during normal gait, and 
may be associated with what is 
called the primary respiratory 
mechanism.
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 20CSF Drainage Into Venous Sinuses
The venous sinuses are formed by 
folds in the dura as the meningeal 
dura comes in contact with the 
internal periosteal dura.
The venous sinuses are at a very low 
pressure system as is the CSF system.
Back pressure caused by dural
tensions can inhibit drainage of CSF 
into the venous sinuses.
Cerebrospinal Fluid
CSF is formed at a hydrostatic pressure of 15 mm water, which 
provides force for CSF movement. 
Ependymal cilia produce currents that propel CSF toward the 
fourth ventricle and its foramina into the subarachnoid spaces. 
In addition the CSF venous gradient at the sinuses in man is 
approximately 5-6 mm water and augments CSF circulation. 
Since the forces involved in CSF circulation are quantitatively 
slight so, too, would be the pressure required to compromise this 
circulation.

Abnormal dural tensions can interfere with normal 
cranial bone motion and with free blood flow through 
this venous sinus system. 
“Interference with the venous sinus drainage may result 
in increased intracranial venous back pressure which will 
then reduce normal fresh blood delivery to the brain.  
“It may also raise CSF pressure slightly but significantly 
and thereby interfere with the normal movement of this 
vital fluid through the ventricular system of the brain

PEDIATRIC SKULL
Cranial Sutures 
The cranial vault is composed of five main flat bones separated 
by joints known as the cranial sutures. These sutures are 
composed of fibrous connective tissue and act as the main sites 
for cranial growth during development. 
As the cranial vault expands, bone is deposited at the 
growing edges of the bone (the bone fronts), while the 
suture mesenchyme remains undifferentiated. 
Sutures provide flexible joints for passage through the birth 
canal, act as shock absorbers, prevent separation of the cranial 
bones, and accommodate room for the rapidly growing brain. 
With the exception of the metopic suture, human sutures 
normally do not fuse until the third or fourth decade of life. 
The Cranial Base 
The cranial base is the most complex structure of the human 
skeleton and its main function is to protect and support the 
brain. 
The cranial base is also the first region of the skull to reach adult 
size and is the structural foundation of many aspects of the 
craniofacial architecture. 
In addition, it also connects with the rest of the body, articulates 
with the vertebral column and the mandible, provides conduits 
for all the vital neural and circulatory connections between the 
brain and the face and neck, houses and connects the sense 
organs in the skull and forms the roof of the nasopharynx. 
The shape of the cranial base is therefore a multi-factorial 
product of numerous phylogenetic, developmental and 
functional interactions.

ICPA 30CSF CIRCULATION
CSF flows from the choroid plexus > lateral ventricles > 3th ventricle > 4rd 
ventricle (cerebellum) > down the spinal cord > into the sacrum > up the 
spinal column (through the subarachnoid space) into the sagittal sinus. 
Cranial expansion and contraction creates and reciprocates with sacral flexion 
and extension movement. 
Blood flow into the brain produces cerebrospinal fluid in the choroid plexus. 
Normal levels of CSF fill the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoid 
cavity. 
Increases in CSF enlarge the ventricles and subarachnoid cavity and therefore 
expand the cranium. When CSF pressure reaches the set pressure point, the 
amount of CSF production decreases. 
When the amount of CSF absorption at the sagittal sinus and CSF flow to the 
periphery exceeds production, the internal pressure decreases and the 
cranium contracts. 
This repetition of expansion and contraction is what Sacro Occipital 
Technique considers the primary respiratory mechanism of cranial 
dynamics. 
Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI)
A subtle pulse wave independent of vascular or respiratory 
influences.  Purportedly influenced by changes in brain, spinal 
cord, and glial cell dynamics creating a wave-like motion much 
like a back and forth, side to side fluid motion.
Cranial Rhythmic Impulse (CRI)
The normal CRI is 8-12 beats/waves per minute and can be felt 
almost anywhere on the skull. 
When palpating for CRI in different areas the frequency and 
intensity of the pulse should be equal. 
Differences in CRI within the cranium denotes a problem. 
Decreased CRI can be indicative of stagnation due to dural sinus 
torsion, decreased vitality and impeded brain development. 
Increased CRI can be indicative of areas of seizure activity and 
hyperactivity syndromes. 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 31Cranial Bone Remodeling 
Two Major Forces 
The first is the tension exerted by the dura on the attachment 
points to the specific cranial bones, the sutures and the 
contiguous nature between the dural tissue and the periosteum 
of the cranial bones. 
The second is the internal pressure exerted on the internal 
aspects of the cranial bones by the cerebrospinal fluid as it flows 
through the dural sinuses. 
These forces work in a similar manner to gravity causing bone 
remodeling dependent upon mechanical stress. In the living 
body, load or muscular activity serves as an extracellular 
stimulus that is transmitted to cells and modulates their genetic 
growth and differentiation, leading to what is known as the 
functional matrix hypothesis [60].

Cranial Diagnostics: Palpation
Palpation of CSF Pulsations
The CSF fluctuates with hemodynamic changes most 
strongly affected by respiratory and vascular related 
pressure variants.
Independent of vascular or respiratory influences cranial 
practitioners have found a pulse wave independent called 
the “Cranial Rhythmic Impulse” by DeJarnette.
This pulse wave is subtle and is purportedly influenced by 
changes in brain, spinal cord, and glial cell dynamics 
creating a wave-like motion akin to a back and forth and 
side to side fluid motion at a frequency approximately 8-12 
times per minute.
Cranial Diagnostics: Palpation 
Palpation of CSF Pulsations
The CSF pulse waves can be felt by way of feeling a heart beat 
or deep inhalation or exhalation.  
The pulse wave can be enhanced by dorsiflexingthe feet on 
inhalation and plantarflexingon exhalation creating changes 
in dural tension.
The following exercise is used to develop the skill of palpation 
for the CRI. 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 35Cranial Diagnostics: Palpation
CSF Pulsations: CRI Exercise
For the next 2-3 minutes focus on the various pulsations, both 
cardiovascular, respiratory and possibly others. 
Focus on the motions of the head related to respiration by 
having the patient emphasize increased inhalation and/or 
exhalation, and then holding their breath for 10-15 seconds, 
noting any changes in pulsations.Allow the patient’s occiput to 
gently rest on the relaxed fingers 
of the doctor whose forearms are 
supported on the table, feet on 
the floor, eyes closed, and tension 
in the shoulders, arms and hands 
completely released . 
Cranial Diagnostics 
The Dural Influence 
While maintaining your contact have the 
patient return to a normal breathing cycle. 
During inhalation have them dorsiflextheir 
feet strongly and plantarflexon exhalation. 
This changes the tension on the dural 
meningeal system. 
Next have the patient plantarflexone foot 
and dorsiflexthe other on each inhalation 
and exhalation. This will create a dural stress 
pattern. 
Try to feel the different dural influences on 
the respiratory mechanics. 
Cranial Diagnostics: Palpation
CSF Pulsations: Hemodynamic & CRI Exercise
After gaining some sense of the affects of 
respiration on the cranium, attempt to 
screen out the respiratory motion and 
focus on the subtle cardiovascular 
pulsations for a couple minutes.
Then attempt to screen out temporarily 
both the cardiovascular and respiratory 
motions and open yourself to whatever 
other pulsations might present 
themselves.
Greater sensation is perceived with gentle 
pressure, most of the force occurring from 
merely allowing the weight of the occiput 
to rest on the doctor’s relaxed fingers.

Imagine that the hands are totally molded to the head 
and with this whole hand contact, shift the focus to the 
proprioceptors in the wrists and lower arms.
Try to feel with your hands and attempt to magnify the
very small amount of actual cranial motion available for
palpation, as if the skull were expanding and contracting
laterally to a very slow rhythm, unrelated to
cardiovascular or respiratory function, generally 8-12
cycles per minute.
A faint wave-like pushing may be noted, and as this is 
developed, attempt to assess pulsations for symmetry 
from side to side, and from the front to the back of the 
cranium.

Cranial Adjusting Techniques 
Basic Adjusting Guidelines 
Pain indicators, CRI and primary and secondary ranges 
of motion are indicators of cranial subluxations. 
Visual analysis, dollar signs, and crest signs are 
indicators of the location and position of the cranial 
subluxation. Dollar Sign is related to occiput, Crest sign related to Temporal Bone
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 42Basic Adjusting Guidelines 
Palpatorypain or swelling at the Bregma(junction of the coronal 
and sagittal sutures) is present when the Frontal bone is 
subluxated. 
Pain and swelling at the Pterion (junction of the frontal, parietal 
and temporal bones) is evident when the Temporal and Occipital 
bones are subluxated. 
Pain and swelling at the Lambda (juncture of the lambdoidand 
sagittal sutures) is present in Occipital bone subluxations. 
Pain and swelling at the Asterion( where the lambdoid, occipital-
mastoid and squamosal sutures meet) is noted when any type of 
major skull distortion or subluxation is active. 
Guidelines for Infant Cranial Corrections
Since respiration is not a useful tool in the pediatric patient, 
corrections are made using either direct or indirect procedures by 
holding the “lesioned” bone through several respiratory cycles until 
a release is obtained.
Once correction is made it is crucial to hold the correction for at 
least 4 cycles to allow the cranium to adapt to the correction.
Balance of the CRI and release of dural tension are major indicators 
of successful correction.
If blanching occurs when correction is made, you must check the 
blanched area or bone for subluxation as a guide to your next 
correction.
If direct or indirect techniques are not working, stabilizing the pelvis 
or placing the child into Flexion (dorsiflexor traction the feet) or 
Extension (plantarflexor push the feet cephalad) is usually effective.
Guidelines for Pediatric Cranial Adjusting
Think of adjusting soft taffy and molding it with your hands.
You must remove fascial restrictions to allow CSF movement. 
These two factors are the greatest forces in remodeling the skull. 
In pediatric cranial adjusting the preferred order of individual 
bone correction is: 
Occiput/Sphenobasilar –Temporal –Frontal -Maxilla –Palate 
In the infant, contacts are made in a flow pattern and often the 
internal contact is maintained while the external corrections are 
performed with one hand on the outside. 
Once the specific correction is done, two handed extra-oral 
techniques can be applied for final correction and balancing. 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 43When clearing cranial subluxation patterns, the order of 
correction is usually Occipital, Temporal then Frontal. 
In infants, the Sphenobasilar mechanism should be corrected 
with the occiput. 
Cranial lesions should be corrected from Lower Brain center first 
before moving on to upper level functions. 
Primal brain survival mode –Occiput –Cerebellum 
Midbrain, emotion level –Sphenobasilar –Pons, Hypothalamus 
Cortical functions, higher level integration –Frontal –Cerebral 
Cortex 
Response to Touch/Pressure 
Four levels of therapeutic touch are necessary for work with the 
pediatric cranium 
– Lightest level facilitates the movement of CSF 
– Second level facilitates dural meningeal tension
– Third level controls secondary respiratory/diaphragmatic 
motion 
– Fourth level facilitates suturalmobility and fixation (manual 
corrections) 
Skull Molding (Plagiocephaly)
Your receiving hand leaves a slight gap opposite the contact point 
to allow the cranium to mold into it. 
*Always stabilize the pelvis during molding Skull molding is necessary for good 
cranial and dural mechanics. If the 
cranium protrudes too far to the 
right, or is too elongated, or bulges in 
one area the correction is necessary. 
It is always done by the direct 
approach. 
Hold the area opposite the 
protrusion with the palmer surface of 
your hand. 
Gently press on the protruded 
(opposite) side with a slow steady 
pressure. 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 44CSF AND CRANIAL BONE BALANCING 
AND DIRECTING TECHNIQUES These techniques are to be used to increase, decrease and direct 
the movement of cerebrospinal fluid throughout the cranial and 
spinal dural system. 
Cranial Rhythm Impulse Technique
Used to balance CRI throughout the meningeal system 
Your hands are placed together 
with little fingers touching and the 
fingertips are placed directly under 
the inferior nuchal line. 
Feel for CRI pulses in all eight 
fingertips. 
If any finger feels a weaker pulse, 
slightly increase pressure at the 
contact point to increase the 
intensity of the pulse.
Hold the contacts until all pulses 
are felt evenly. 
CSF Balancing 
Place your thenar pads on the 
mastoid body only, be sure not to 
contact the process or tip. 
On inhalation, roll the thenars
medially and posterior and hold 
(flexion). 
On exhalation, release the pressure. 
Repeat the process for 10-60 seconds 
until blanching occurs on the frontal 
bone. 
Mastoid Control
Body –controls vascular supply to brain.
Process –controls vestibular mechanism (balance, hearing, etc.) 
Tip –controls muscular system
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 45These procedures stimulate all body functions and help 
make the child more receptive to adjustments. 
These may be useful for patients with hypoglycemia, 
decreased blood pressure, shortness of breath, asthma 
related to kidney function, water retention, swollen 
extremities, stimulating thought processing, 
constipation, decreased thyroid function, loss of 
appetite, low grade body pains, and numbness of 
hands and feet. 
CSF Regulation Technique Part I
(Used to regulate speed of CSF movement) 
Place one hand under the occiput 
perpendicular to the spine, medial to the 
occipital-mastoid suture. 
Place index or middle finger of your other 
hand on the frontal bone, one inch above 
the glabella. 
On inhalation compress the occiput 
medially at the lateral borders while gently 
pressing the frontal contact posterior and 
slightly superior. 
On exhalation relax the contacts. 
During this process it is imperative that the doctor controls the 
rate of the respiratory cycles to allow the CRI pulse to slow down 
to the normal 8-12 pulses per minute .
CSF Regulation Technique Part II 
Once CRI is stabilized place your thumb 
inside the infant’s mouth at the 
posterior medial aspect of the hard 
palate your other hand remains on the 
occiput. 
Your middle finger of the same hand 
resumes the frontal contact. 
On inhalation the thumb contact 
presses straight superior while the 
middle finger presses posterior and 
inferior in a pumping motion. 
Repeat 4 times or until you feel the 
palate and frontal contacts soften and 
the tissue become pliable. 
If you are unable to place your 
finger in the patient’s mouth they 
can press their tongue against the 
palate and you maintain Part I 
contact position.
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 46CSF Regulation Technique
The CSF Regulation Technique is most often used in 
states of hyperactivity (to regulate and slow things 
down) but can be used to speed up hypoactive 
conditions. 
Often useful in patients with ADHD, sympathetic 
dominance conditions, hyperthyroid or pituitary states, 
hormonal imbalances, insomnia, anxiety, integration 
disorders, hypersensitivity and anytime you want to 
effect the speed of CSF mechanics through the entire 
dural meningeal system. 
Ventricular Bulb Technique
Stimulates the movement of CSF, Milks the 4th ventricle, 
Vitalizes body fluids, and Drains cerebral tissues 
Place your thenar pads just medial to the 
occipital-mastoid sutures. Make certain not 
to cover the suture or touch the temporal 
bones. 
On the inhalation compress your thenars
medially, backward and inferior causing the 
chin to elevate slightly. 
On exhalation move the thenarsceilingward, 
anterior and roll them laterally (supinate 
your hands). 
Continue this motion for 3 complete 
respiratory cycles, maintaining a medial 
pressure on the occiput at all times. On the 
4th respiratory cycle complete the inhalation 
phase then release the contacts on 
exhalation. 
We are progressively 
increasing the flexion of the 
occiput and dura to create a 
rebound (bow and arrow) 
response on the last 
respiratory phase.
With CSF stagnation these techniques can be helpful in 
patients with: congestion, inflammation, edema, 
glaucoma, insomnia, migraines, shock, fainting, inactive 
pituitary, toxemia, arthritis, emotional states involving 
depression, spasticity, hypotension, atrophy, and 
degenerative diseases.  Ventricular Bulb Technique can 
be useful in restoring normal CSF movement.

ICPA 47SPHENOBASILAR SYMPHYSIS 
CORRECTIONS 
Sphenoid Mechanics 
Since sphenoid articulates with twelve bones: four single, 
the vomer, ethmoid, frontal, and occipital; and four paired, 
the parietal, temporal, zygomatic, and palatine its position 
and function controls the entire cranio-facial mechani cs. 
Sphenobasilar Corrections 
The sphenobasilar is the key to the entire cranium 
because it effects all other cranial articulations and 
articulates with 12 cranial/facial bones 
This technique is useful for any condition that affects the 
cranial nerves (9 of 12 cranial nerves pass through its 
foramen) as well as visceral conditions except those 
involving the descending colon. 
It is also useful in respiratory problems, TMJ, cervical and 
reciprocal tension membrane dysfunction. It relates 
particularly to the medulla, spinal cord, hypothalamus 
and pituitary.

Sphenobasilar Symphysis Technique 
The objective of Sphenobasilar Symphysis Technique(SBS) is to 
balance the cranial meningeal dura. 
The SBS technique gives the doctor the ability to access overall 
cranial dural tension and ultimately check general ranges of 
motion of the cranium as a whole. 
The methods used for correction are either “indirect” or “direct” 
techniques. 
Indirect technique has the doctor take the cranium in the 
position it moves the easiest and hold it in that position until a 
softening, “relaxing sensation” and a warmth is noted in the 
tissues. 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 49Sphenoid and Sphenobasilar Corrections 
EXTENSION
FLEXIONWith these contacts you can 
correct flexion/extension lesions, 
sphenobasilar torsion, lateral 
flexion distortions, CSF 
imbalances, and sphenobasilar 
translation subluxations 
This contact is useful when more 
restriction is noted especially in 
the dura 
With this contact a counter 
rotation can be applied to 
correct, lateral strain, 
sidebending, translation or 
vertical strain at the same time 
as the flexion or extension 
correction 
Sphenobasilar Symphysis 
Occipital Frontal Approach-Direct Approach
Place the palm of one hand under the 
occiput perpendicular to the spine. 
While straddling the frontal bone, 
place the thumb and index or middle 
finger of the other hand on the 
greater wings of the sphenoid. Make 
sure not to contact the frontal bone. 
Gently torque your hands clockwise 
and counterclockwise, in opposite 
directions while feeling for restriction 
in motion in the occiput, sphenoid or 
sphenobasilar junction. 
When restriction is noted in the 
rotational component, hold the 
segment in the restricted position. 
While maintaining this 
position, bring the occiput 
and sphenoid into flexion and 
extension until you feel a 
release and/or an increase in 
motion. 
Sphenobasilar Symphysis
Occipital Frontal Approach-Indirect Approach
If the direct technique is unsuccessful 
in restoring normal motion, use the 
indirect technique. 
In this instance, you hold the restricted 
cranial bone into the position it moves 
more readily and again place the 
occiput and sphenoid into flexion and 
extension. 

MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 50Sphenobasilar Symphysis Technique 
–Inhalation Correction 
Place your index fingers on the sphenoid wings, middle fingers to 
temporal squama, ring fingers to parietals and little fingers to 
occiput. Your thumbs are crossed above the bregma but do not 
touch the skull. 
On inhalation/flexion gently tug on the 
temporal squama and parietals posterior and 
inferior (external) with the middle and ring 
fingers.
Do not move the index finger contact on 
the sphenoid. 
Remain in flexion/inhalation until you feel an
equal bilateral CRI pulse at the sphenoid 
wings. 
Relax the contacts in the 
extension/exhalation phase of respiration 
and repeat 3 times. 
Repeat until bilateral CRI is present 
Sphenobasilar Symphysis Technique 
–Exhalation Correction 
Place your index fingers on the sphenoid wings, middle fingers to 
temporal squama, ring fingers to parietals and little fingers to 
occiput. Your thumbs are crossed above the bregma but do not touch 
the skull. 
If an equal bilateral pulse cannot be 
produced on the flexion phase, place the 
patient into extension/exhalation. 
During exhalation, your middle and ring 
finger contacts pull anterior and superior 
(internal) on the temporal squama and 
parietal bones. Again the sphenoid 
contacts remain stationary and monitor 
the CRI pulse. 
Repeat until bilateral CRI is present. 
TEMPORAL BONE RESPIRATORY 
LESIONS Used when the occiput or temporal bones are locked in 
either flexion/external rotation or extension/internal 
rotation 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 51Temporal INTERNAL Correction 
The right index finger contacts the 
mastoid furrow and directs motion 
anterior and medial while the right 
thenar guides the temporal squamal
motion. 
As the index finger moves the mastoid 
back anterior and medial the thenar 
guides the temporal squamaposteriorly 
and externally, following the perimeter 
of the temporal squama. 
The correction can be repeated 2-3 
times. These motions are 
initiated only on 
INHALATION and 
pressure is maintained 
on exhalation
Temporal EXTERNAL Correction 
The doctor's index finger contacts the 
anterior mastoid furrow while the 
thenar guides the right temporal 
squamaupwards and medially. 
Each time the right index moves the 
mastoid body and process posterior 
and laterally, the thenar guides the 
temporal squamaperimeter superior 
and anterior (internal). 
The correction can be repeated 2-3 
times These motions are 
initiated only on
EXHALATION and 
pressure is maintained 
on inhalation .
TEMPORAL BONE BALANCING 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 52Temporal Bone Corrections 
Step 1 -Decreased Temporal Bone Unilateral Motion 
The fingers of your hands are interlaced with the palms 
facing up forming a pocket for the base of the skull. Slip 
your interlaced hands under the skull resting the 
patient’s mastoids on your thenar pads. 
Have the patient inhale and exhale and feel for normal 
motion. 
If correction is necessary on inhalation gently flare your 
elbows laterally and lightly compress your thenar against 
the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, bringing it 
into external rotation. 
On exhalation return your elbows to their original 
position allowing the temporals to move into internal 
rotation. 
If the temporals fail to go into internal rotation on the 
next respiratory cycle gently compress the posterior 
portion of your thenars above the temporal mastoid 
suture and lift slightly posterior and cephalid. 
This procedure is useful in facilitating the 
patients response to any adjustment as it levels 
off CSF, builds body resiliency, and promotes 
healing. 
Temporal Bone Corrections
Step 2 –Reciprocal Temporal Rocker Technique
Used in instances were temporal fixation and CSF will not respond. 
If motion cannot be restored with 
Step I this technique is usually very 
effective for restoring normal 
temporal motion. 
Create a bowl for the occiput with 
interlaced fingers as previously 
done in Step I.
Doctor’s thenarscontact the entire 
mastoid (body, process and tip) 

MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 53Temporal Corrections  
Step II continued 
If one temporal is restricted and the 
other moves more freely this 
technique is applied. 
Stabilize the side with normal motion 
while correcting the restricted side 
during the proper respiratory phase. 
If movement is restricted going into 
external rotation correct on 
inhalation. If movement is restricted 
moving into internal rotation correct 
on exhalation. 
After balance is obtained, 
perform Step 1 to make sure 
both temporals move freely.
DeJarnettesuggests that the Temporal Corrections 
(Step II) technique may be helpful in balancing dural 
sinus fluid imbalances in patients with ear infections, 
vestibular conditions, TMJ involvements and tinnitus. 
Temporal Corrections
Step lll-Temporal Reciprocating Technique
Increases flow of CSF
If Step II fails to balance the temporal motion 
then apply Step III
Place your thenar pads over the entire 
mastoid. 
On inhalation one thenar moves the mastoid 
anterior and medially while the opposite 
thenar holds the other mastoid stable. 
On exhalation the stabilized mastoid is 
moved posterior and inferior while the first 
mastoid is now held stationary. 
Repeat by reciprocating mastoid movement 
until both mastoids move freely and equally. 

MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 54Temporal Reciprocating Technique
Step III is useful in dealing with patients whose 
presentations include: general fatigue, weakness, 
exhaustion, continual tiredness, frustration, skin 
diseases, all body functions appear below par, 
hypothyroid, impotence, constipation due to general 
loss of total vitality, learning problems, fainting and 
vagotonia. 
Temporal Bone Correction Review 
STEP I
Elbows flare and relax with 
equal motion. If restriction 
go to step II. 
STEP II -RTRT
Hold side that moves easier 
and move restricted side. If 
still restricted then go to 
step lll.STEP III -TRT
Move one side into external 
rotation –hold –move the other

OCCIPITAL BONE BALANCING 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 56Occipital Pump Aids in directing the CSF into a normal
pattern throughout the total dural meningeal system
On exhalation allow the cranium to return to its original position. 
Continue this procedure until the occipital motion becomes fluid 
and equal CSF pulse is felt at you fingertips. Place your fingertips just medial to 
the occipital-mastoid suture, with 
you thumbs resting on the parietal 
squama .
On inhalation spread your fingers at 
the occipital-mastoid suture area 
laterally, as if stretching the occiput, 
and slightly anterior. The thumb 
contacts are for stabilization only and 
create no motion. Useful in instances where skull tippageremains after other 
corrections are made and there is no spinal, extremity or pelvic 
imbalance noted. The application of this technique is useful on 
torticollis and after intra-oral frontal bone corrections. 
FRONTAL BONE BALANCING 
Frontal Molding 
The rest of your fingers draw the lateral aspect of the frontal 
bone superior and slightly lateral during inhalation and 
exhalation. When you feel the frontal bone move, spread your 
thumbs laterally, as if spreading the meitopicsuture. Place your crossed thumbs on the 
frontal bone just below the coronal 
suture and on either side of the 
meitopicsuture. 
The balance of your fingers are placed 
at the lateral angle and side of the 
frontal bone.
Press your right thumb gently into the 
left side of the frontal bone and your 
left thumb into the right side directly 
inferior. 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 57Frontal Molding 
Once the lateral angles are free and 
you have spread the meitopic
suture, complete this part of the 
procedure by pressing the frontal 
eminence on the low skull side to 
toward the high skull side. 
Immediately shift your contacts to 
the “Frontal Fruit Jar” procedure 
and perform this correction to set 
the frontal angles. 
One hand straddles the frontal bone 
and contacts the lateral angles with 
the thumb on one side and the index 
and middle fingers on the other. 
Your other hand grasps the malar 
bone between between the thumb 
and index fingers on each side of the 
malar. 
Hold the frontal bone immobile while 
you slowly push and pull malar bones 
left and right as if you were trying to 
twist open the lid of a jar. Frontal Fruit Jar –Can beusefulin facial pain, frontal 
headaches, cluster migraines, TMJproblems, eye problems, migraines

Craniofacial Technique 
This technique according to DeJarnette may be helpful to patients with 
Parkinson’s Disease, Bell’s Palsy, TMJ, constant bruxism, headaches, teething. 
After you feel the tissues 
relax maintain the traction 
as you slowly rotate the 
head en masse left to right 
then side bend it left to 
right. This creates a release 
in the dural membranes at 
their attachments. With a flat hand contact stabilize the 
frontal, anterior border of the parietals, 
the sphenoid and the anterior border of 
the temporals. 
With the other hand place your thumb 
and index finger on either side of the 
malar bones below the zygomatic process 
while the remainder of the hand rests on 
either side of the mandible. 
Hold the stabilization hand (skull 
contacts) still after applying a slight pull 
superior (cephalid) and posterior.

OTHER SPECIFIC CRANIAL 
TECHNIQUES 
C-Section Technique -used for C-section births to
normalize ventricular and general subarachnoid CSF pressure 
Rest the infant’s occiput on your thenar 
pads. Interlace your fingers to form a bowl to 
make sure that only your thenarstouch the 
occiput medial to the occipital-mastoid 
suture. 
Gently and slowly squeeze the thenars
compressing the occiput medially to re-
create the waves of uterine contractions. 
Continue squeezing without respiration to 
create a rhythmic pulsation throughout the 
cranium. 
As the skull appears to become soft and 
pliable, slowly increase the speed and 
pressure of the contractions until a strong, 
steady rhythm and CRI pulse are produced. 
Hypo-Function Technique -This technique can be used 
to increase circulation, reduce fatigue, apprehension and nervousness. It can aid in 
the reduction of arm, leg and back pains exacerbated by exertion. Its application is 
also helpful in patients whose mental processes are slower than normal, who have 
diabetes, are hypersensitive to pain, and have numbness in their arms and legs at 
rest. 
Place your thenar pads on the lateral 
aspects of the occiput making certain 
not to touch the occipital-mastoid 
suture. 
Compress your thenarstowards each 
other as if squeezing the occiput. 
Repeat this compression once per 
second for 10-20 seconds. 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 61Hyper-Function Technique –Useful inhyper-activity 
states, insomnia. 
Fingertips support occipitomastoid
and lamboidalsuture so full weight 
of the head rests on fingertips. 
On inhalation press your fingertips 
into the suture and hold for 20 
seconds, as the patient holds their 
breath. 
Have the patient exhale, take 
another full respirtatorycycle and 
repeat for a total of 3 cycles. 
Procedure decreases CSF pulsations 
in region of 4th ventricle 
Eustachian Tube Technique 
In children the eustachiantube is shorter, wider and oriented 
more horizontal than in adults making them more subject to 
infections due to impeded drainage.
Bringing the mastoids posterior and medial stretches the 
eustachiantube. Pressure to the glabella, transmits pressure 
through the midline of the ethmoidand sphenoid, relaxing 
tension on the tube.
Alternating pressure by stretching and relaxing helps to 
equalize pressure in the eustachiantube and prevent fluid 
stagnation.  Following procedure check to determine need for 
RTRT.
Eustachian Tube Technique 
On exhalation relax the total mastoid pressure and apply 
pressure only to the mastoid body and hold the contact in a 
superior and anterior (towards the eyes) direction. The assistant 
relaxes their contact. Process is repeated until fluid motion is felt 
on both mastoids. Thenars contact the mastoid processes 
bilaterally with an assistant lightly 
contacting the glabella with thumb OR 
doctor makes a single hand contact on 
mastoids and contacts glabella with the 
thumb of free hand.
As patient inhales compress the entire 
mastoids medially and anterior, bringing 
the temporal bone into external rotation. 
At the same time the assistant or doctor 
rocks the glabella side to side and presses 
superior/posteriorly. 

MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 62Sagittal Parietal Release Part I –
Useful in patients with seizure related conditions, chronic fevers, chills and 
bodily aches and pains . 
Place your crossed thumbs above the 
vertex of the skull, but do not contact 
skull. 
Place your finger tips on the inferior 
margins on the parietal bones just above 
the parietal-temporal suture. 
On inhalation, your fingertips lift the 
parietals superior and posterior 
(external). 
On exhalation, hold the parietals in the 
superior position and then move them 
anterior at the end of exhalation. 
When normal parietal movement is felt, 
continue to the next step. 
Sagittal Parietal Release Part II –
Useful in patients with seizure related conditions, chronic fevers, chills and 
bodily aches and pains. 
Place your thumbs just posterior to the 
bregmaand the balance of your fingers to 
the parietal squama. The finger contacts 
are merely stabilizing. 
Search the sagittal suture for depressions 
or prominences. 
If prominences are noted (internal), 
forcibly spread the sagittal suture during 
inhalation and exhalation. 
If depressions (external) are noted, 
forcefully compress the sagittal suture 
during both phases of respiration. 
Cranial Bowl Lift –
Helps create a relaxed and comfortable feeling. 
Very useful in hyperactivity syndromes and sympathetic dominant visceral 
patterns. 
. 
Place thumbs on the top of the 
patient’s skull just lateral to the 
Bregma
Your index fingers are on the 
sphenoid wings, the middle fingers 
are on the temporal squama, the 
ring fingers are placed on the 
parietal squamajust above the 
temporal-parietal suture, and the 
little fingers are placed on the 
occiput. 
NEVER place thumbson 
Bregma
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 63Cranial Bowl Lift –continued
Helps create a relaxed and comfortable feeling. 
Very useful in hyperactivity syndromes and sympathetic dominant visceral patterns . 
. 
On inhalation lift your index, middle 
and ring fingers cephalid(towards you) 
and slightly posterior (towards the 
table-external). 
At the same time the thumbs spread 
the parietals while the little fingers 
bring the occiput inferior into flexion. 
On exhalation, rock all fingers gently, 
back and forth, then release the 
pressure and guide the cranium back 
into a neutral position. Make sure all 
cranial bones reseat themselves 
properly. 
NEVER place thumbson 
Bregma
Examination procedures must include tests to 
determine both meningeal and structural patterns.  
In this module we are going to be dealing with the 
pre-ambulatory infant.

The Infant Examination 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 65Inverted Swing Test –
Contraindications –hip dysplasia, ventricular shunt, recent 
hematoma or head trauma
Grasp infant with one hand under 
the occiput while the other hand 
holds the legs proximal to the ankles. 
(If infant is too large, grasp the legs 
only, holding one in each hand.) 
Slowly raise the infant off the table 
until fully suspended upside down. 
Gently induce a mild swinging 
motion. A normal child will hang 
relaxed and unconcerned. 
Inverted Swing Test –continued
Contraindications –hip dysplasia, ventricular shunt, recent 
hematoma or head trauma
If child laterally bends or rotates their 
head it is evidence of a cervical 
subluxation. 
If the child exhibits a short leg you are 
dealing with a Category II. 
If the legs remain balanced but the child 
tenses a possible Category I is present. 
Finally, if the head flexes or extends or 
there is significant blanching and flushing 
a cranial lesion is indicated. (See cranial 
section for indicators) 
Atlas Occipital Compression 
This is caused by a hyperextension type 
trauma and is found by extending and 
flexing the infant’s occiput upon the atlas 
condyles. 
Hold the child’s occiput with a four finger 
contact while placing the thumbs anterior to 
the ear. Gently rock the head into extension 
then flexion. 
If there is restriction while trying to bring 
the head into flexion the condyles may be 
hyperextended. This means the atlas 
condyles are posterior to the occipital 
condyles 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 66Condylar System (High Occiput) 
Palpate the tension at the atlas occipital 
condyles bilaterally. Gently rock the infants 
head back and forth till relaxed then release 
contacts 
Feel for the side with the most tension plus 
restricted range of motion, especially on 
side bending or lateral flexion is the side of 
the high occiput. 
With the patient in the supine position, 
when released, the chin will tend to deviate 
towards the high occiput side. 
Cervical Stairstep
Have the child supine on top of the parent. 
Spread your fingers so that the index and 
middle fingers are in front of the ear and the 
ring and little fingers are behind the ear. 
(Use your fingertips as contacts) 
Your thumbs gently rest on the parietals 
approximately 3/4” from the suture. 
Gently compress the head and cervical spine 
caudally. Feel for four distinct steps. 
These represent the motion of the motor 
units of the cervical spine 
If a step locks and you can’t get past it, the subluxation is one 
of fixation 
If you skip a step and go past it to the next step, the 
subluxation is one of hypermobility Step 1 = T1-C7
Step 2 = C6-C5
Step 3 = C4-C3
Step 4 = C2-C1 
Cervical/Occipital Review 

MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 67Sacrum and Ilium 
Sacro-Occipital Respiratory Motion
Exhalation/Extension Inhalation/Flexion
Sacro-Occipital Reciprocal motion 
*To create flexion (inhalation) 
and extension (exhalation) 
traction the child’s legs inferior 
to mimic flexion and release 
for extension. Place one hand on the sacrum and the other on the occiput. Feel 
for reciprocal motion. 
On inhalation the sacral base moves superior and caudal and the 
occiput moves inferior and anterior, into flexion. 
The reverse is true on exhalation/extension. 
Sacral apex moves superior and caudal while the occiput moves 
posterior and superior. 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 68Anterior Sacrum Evaluation 
Place the child in prone position 
on the table or on top of parent. 
The doctor bends one leg at a 
time towards buttock. 
The legs should flex towards the 
buttocks evenly. If they do not 
you need to check for an anterior 
sacrum 
The indicator for sacral anteriority 
is the nuchal ligament at its 
attachment to the occiput. 
A swollen tight nuchal ligament 
on one side is indicative of an 
anterior sacrum on that side. 
Sacro-iliac subluxation 
Press directly over the SI joint on each side of the pelvis. If the 
infant cries or shows signs of discomfort the innominate is 
sacrallysubluxated. 
If the parent states that the child is difficult to diaper, especially 
if the infant struggles or won’t separate their legs, you have a 
sacral dural pull subluxation.
Palpation and Evaluation of the Dollar Sign 
A positive dollar sign indicator is present when the area 
designated as the dollar sign (where the gluteus medius, 
minimusand maximusand the piriformisconverge) is palpated 
and either a hyper or hypo tonicity in found in one in 
relationship to the other. 
Also pain or discomfort may be elicited in one. 
In pediatrics the dollar sign that is the most taut or tender is 
considered the major and it the one that is corrected first. 
A major dollar sign is indicative of meningeal or dural 
subluxations that tend to have more of a global effect on the 
central nervous system. 
These subluxation patterns usually respond better to techniques 
that are lower force and are designed to affect the dural and 
primary respiratory mechanisms.
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 69Palpation and Evaluation of the Dollar Sign 
The doctor uses their thumb or 
index finger to palpate the 
tension in each dollar sign and 
compares them to each other. 
Mild to moderate pressure is 
used at the central aspect of 
the dollar signs in P-A 
direction. 
In infants the dollar sign is 
located 1” lateral then 2” 
inferior of the PSIS.
Palpation and Evaluation of the Crest Sign 
A positive crest sign is present when there is increased tension 
on one side in relation to the opposing crest sign. 
It is usually indicative of a predominantly structural, 
musculoskeletal subluxation complex that will respond well to 
more structurally oriented techniques or HVLA adjustments. 
Palpation and Evaluation of the Crest Sign 
To locate the active or major crest 
sign, with your thumbs gently roll 
off the crest of ilium 1” lateral to 
the PSIS at the level of L4 and 
press gently medially towards the 
spine. 
Increased tissue resistance or 
tension in this area (where the 
quadratuslumborumand erector 
spinaeintersect) is indicative of a 
positive crest sign in need of 
correction. 

MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 70Sacroiliac Mobility 
Sacro-iliac mobility should be equal on each side. 
With child in the supine position, place the thumb of each hand 
on the ASIS and the index finger on the PSIS (straddling Ilium). 
Gently apply a rocking motion to each ilium in an A-P direction, 
feel for normal motion."" 
Sacrum and Ilium Review 
Leg Length Discrepancy 
Cervical involvement determination 
Descending pattern? 
Should be done prone and supine 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 71Leg Length Discrepancy 
Check leg lengths in the prone and 
supine position. 
Have parent or assistant gently rotate 
the head left and right while you look for 
a change in the leg length. 
If a clear leg discrepancy is not present 
gently traction the infant’s legs and 
recheck while maintaining a slight 
traction. 
Supine, use your index finger across the 
Achilles tendon and your thumb across 
the cunieforms. 
Prone, straddle the Achilles with your 
thumbs and index fingers at base of 
ankle the rest of your hand wraps 
around the plantar surface of the foot 
apply slight traction. 
Leg Length Discrepancy 
As the child’s head is turned, while you 
maintain a steady traction look and feel 
for a change in the leg length or Achilles 
tendon. 
If leg length changes during head turning 
but they do not balance then the major 
cervical subluxation is most likely at C2. 
If the leg length balances by head turning 
then the major cervical subluxation is C1. 
If there is no change in the leg length and 
there is a discrepancy then the major 
cervical subluxation is most likely at C3 or 
below 
Standard Examination Procedures in 
the SOT Paradigm 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 72Supine Acetabular Restriction 
Hip adduction and abduction -Leg balance -Arm position, 
contracted or relaxed -Shoulder range of motion -Neck flexion -
Knee to chest abduction 
Acetabular Restriction 
In the supine position grasp the infant’s ankles and feet. Rotate 
the feet medially looking for restriction or limited range of 
motion. The feet should medially rotate internally equally. 
Prone –Posterior Femur 
Leg length 
Acetabular restriction / posterior femur 
In the prone position grasp the infant’s ankles and feet and 
rotate the toes medially. 
Normally both feet should medially rotate equally 
Psoas Check
 With the child lying supine on the table grasp 
supine on the table, grasp the child’s hands at 
the wrists. Bring the arms over the child’s 
head and gently traction the arms towards 
you. Bring the palms together and and 
measure the fingertips.
If there is an imbalance in this in this 
measurement, the side that comes up shorter 
is the side of the contracted psoas and needs 
to be corrected in order to balance the pelvis 
and thediaghragmaticand pelvic transverse 
fascial planes.  
If you are unable to straighten the child’s 
arms overhead, then you can check for psoas 
imbalance by placing your index finger on the 
8thcostal-sternal junction.  The lower side is 
the side of the contracted psoas.

MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 74Where do you start and how do you determine the most 
effective adjusting sequence? 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR 
MAJOR SUBLUXATION 
PATTERN DETERMINATION 
“The only true subluxation you ever see 
must be in a child prior to the age of 
seven years. If this subluxation goes 
uncorrected it becomes a primary source 
of stimulus through life, but the tombs of 
distortion, which form from one 
traumatic experience to the other, soon 
bury this primary subluxation under that 
‘tomb of distortions’.... 
The subluxation that all of us worry about 
occurred some time between birth and 
the seventh year of life, and the remedy 
would of course be careful chiropractic 
care from birth through the seventh year 
of life.” 
MAJOR BERTRAND DE JARNETTE 
Category I Adjusting Sequence 
SOR 
Check for anterior sacrum or sacral segments after     
correction if sacrum is the culprit 
Check for occipital compression or condylar subluxation after 
correction if the occiput is the culprit –positive dollar sign 
may need occipital cranial correction 
Vasomotor Correction (thoracic or lumbar Line 1 procedure) 
Occipital Fiber Analysis and Correction 
Check for Atlas / Axis /Occiput meningeal involvement 
Cervical Spine correction –meningeal techniques preferred 
Cranial Corrections 
CMRT or other soft tissue work (psoas, iliofemoral, diaphragm, 
fascial planes, etc.)
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 75This is the primary lesion in the meningeal subluxation pattern 
even if the original insult was to the upper cervical spine the 
subluxation will be reflected in this primary respiratory 
mechanism 
SACRAL MENINGEAL SUBLUXATION 
PATTERNS AND REDUCTION 
Primary Meningeal Release 
1. SOR Correction –restores normal reciprocal 
motion between the sacrum and occiput. (NOTE: 
Step 1 and Step 2 may be reversed based on the 
doctor’s preference) 
2. Anterior Sacrum Correction –balances the sacral 
boot mechanism to allow for proper sacral nutation 
3. Sacral Pussy Foot and Primary Dural Release –
stresses the dural meningeal system to find and 
correct the primary meningeal subluxation 
4. Locating and Adjusting the primary thoracic or 
lumbar dural meningeal subluxation 
Sacro Occipital Respiratory Motion 
(SOR) 
This is the foundation for the 
correction and detection of the 
subluxation in the meningeal 
subluxation pattern 
Practice feeling the motion both the 
primary and secondary 
Dural motion can be accentuated to 
help determine fascial restrictions by 
having an assistant alternating 
between traction and release of the 
heel tension.

MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 76SacroOccipital Respiratory Motion
(SOR)-continued
Direct –hold the involved segment in the direction of correction 
while moving the normal segment through regular ROM until a 
release is felt 
Indirect –hold segment into the direction it moves easier through 
several cycles until a release is felt and normal motion is restored Start with one hand on the sacrum (parallel to 
the spine and the other on the occiput 
(perpendicular to the spine) 
Be quite and still –feel for motion 
Any imbalance in motion is a positive finding 
and must be balanced 
Direct or indirect method is acceptable (follow 
the path of least resistance) 
Anterior Sacrum Evaluation 
After correcting and balancing the SOR 
you need to check for an anterior 
sacrum 
The indicator for an anterior sacrum in 
the nuchal ligament where it attaches 
to the medial aspect of the occiput 
(either side of the foramen magnum) 
at the inferior nuchal line 
Swelling or tenderness on one side is 
indicative of an anterior sacrum on 
that side 
Anterior Sacrum Adjustment 
The correction is a Logan Basic contact on 
the sacrotuberousligament on the 
anterior side 
Apply a steady gentle pressure cephalad
and ceilingward. 
Maintain the pressure and slightly vector 
the line of drive to create the greatest 
relaxation in the ligament. 
Never vector across the spine 
Monitor the spine nuchal ligament 
indicator for changes in tension to 
determine correction. 
Check the indicator immediately after 
correction
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 77Sacral Pussyfoot 
Used to restore normal motion 
to the sacrum or increase 
movement of CSF/SOR 
towards the cranium 
Also useful in head trauma 
when direct cranial corrections 
are not appropriate 
Set-up 
–Middle finger is placed under 
the L5 spinousprocess and the 
heel of the hand on the sacral 
apex 
Sacral Pussyfoot 
The rest of the spine and occiput can also be monitored during this 
process to determine vasomotor subluxations or normal restoration 
of primary and secondary motion. Correction 
On inhalation or to create flexion the middle 
finger lifts the L5 spinouswhile the heel of 
the hand presses the sacral apex P-A and 
slightly superior 
On exhalation or to create extension the L5 
contact is released and the fingertips (index, 
middle and ring) press the sacral base P-A 
and the heel of the hand releases the 
pressure 
This motion is continued rhythmically until 
normal motion secondary and primary 
respiratory motion is restored. 
Sacro Occipital Respiratory Motion
(SOR) continued 
If no abnormalities are felt this way hold the sacrum in flexion 
and palpate the spine feeling for dural pull subluxation Once normal SOR has been established 
move your occipital to the spine starting 
at the upper thoracic. 
As you move the sacrum into flexion and 
extension use your superior hand to move 
down the spine monitoring normal 
vertebral motion 
On inhalation the spinousesshould move 
inferior and return to normal on 
exhalation 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 78Sacro Occipital Respiratory Motion
(SOR) continued 
Once this subluxation is found it 
should be considered a vasomotor 
subluxation and be adjusted as such 
Find the corresponding cervical 
vertebrae pump the spinousof the 
involved thoracic or lumbar until a 
sympathetic reaction is felt at the 
cervical laminae–then adjust the 
subluxatedvertebrae I-S 
Either use a double thumb toggle or 
a two finger TP contact with a knife 
edge stabilization and thrust 
Category One
Identifying the Cervical Contact
While the spinal pump procedure is being performed at the most 
sensitive spinousprocess contact, the timing of the spinal pump 
procedure is determined by the doctor palpating for heat and/or 
moisture at the transverse process of the cervical contact.
The temperature and/or moisture informs the doctor that the 
vertebra is ready to receive the adjustment.Cervical Contact C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7

Once the SOR is balanced and the vasomotor subluxation is 
neutralized re-check the sacral indicators for anterior sacrum or 
sacral segmental subluxation before moving on.

ICPA 80Prone Pelvic Adjustment –
Positive Dollar Sign 
An assistant or parent grasps the 
child just above the ankles and 
tractions the legs slightly. 
The doctor places their thumbs into 
the dollar signs (an area 
approximately 1 1⁄2“ inferior and 1” 
lateral to the PSIS, the size of a silver 
dollar). 
Rotate the thumbs of each hand 
clockwise and counterclockwise and 
compare the tissue resistance. 
Correction occurs when tissue 
resistance is released and tension in 
both dollar signs are equal. 
Bilateral PSIS Adjustment –
Positive Crest Sign 
Effective for primary structural issues or when the SOR 
does not clear out pelvic subluxation.
Child lies in the prone position either on table or on 
top of one of the parents. 
Take a crossed hand bilateral PSIS contact with the 
pisiform of each hand (right pisiform contacts child’s 
left PSIS and left pisiform contacts right PSIS). 
Stand slightly inferior to the pelvis facing caudally and 
fingers pointing towards the scapulas.
Slowly compress the pelvis in a P-A direction removing 
all slack while at the same time create a slight traction 
laterally of the SI joint. 
When tissue resistance is felt and all the slack is 
removed thrust P-A with a slight medial torque. 
Psoas Correction 
The correction is made on the side where the 
arm measurement is shorter. In the infant this is 
also the side of the lower rib cage when 
measured at the 8th costal sternal junction. 
Stand opposite the side of the contracted psoas. 
One hand grasps the thigh on the side of the 
contracted psoas. The other hand contacts the 
abdomen between the umbilicus and ASIS. 
As you instruct the child to breath in then out on 
exhalation you gently press the abdominal hand 
posterior and lateral then inferior in an arc as the 
other hand slowly brings the thigh medially. 
This can be done 3 times then measure the arms 
or ribcage again. They should be equal. 

MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 81Evaluate the Atlas Occipital Condylar Mechanism first if there 
was a positive leg change test for meningeal restriction. 
If this test was negative, proceed with the Cervical Stairstep
evaluation. 
CERVICAL SPINE EVALUATION AND 
ADJUSTMENTS 
Atlas Condylar System 
Clearing out the condylar 
system of both meningeal and 
structural subluxations before 
beginning cranial work is 
imperative, especially in the 
pediatric patient due to the 
integrative nature of the 
spinal/cranial/dural/meningeal
/ 
periosteal/endosteal/vascular 
systems. 
Atlas/Dural Restriction 
While tractioningthe legs in both 
the prone and supine position 
have the child turn their head to 
the left and right. 
Watch for changes in leg length. 
Leg length changes: 
Legs balance -Atlas subluxation
Legs change but do not balance or 
vacillate -Axis subluxation 
No change in leg length if cervical 
subluxation below axis 
MALONE –Presentation 1 3/5/2019
ICPA 82Atlas/Dural Restriction 
Atlas Correction 
Keep child’s head turned to the side 
that balances the legs. 
Prone –contact the posterior arch of 
atlas on the side opposite of head 
rotation (side towards the table) 
With your other hand contact the 
zygomatic process and as you lift it 
superior and posterior gently increase 
tension on your atlas contact. 
Maintain these contacts until you feel 
a release of tension at the atlas. 
Supine –in this instance you contact 
the posterior arch of atlas on the 
same side of head rotation (side 
facing up) and follow the above 
protocols. 
Axis/Dural Restriction 
The lineofdrivewith theaxiscontact is superiorfromthespinous
through EAM then thesupercilliary arch. 
*Never push the axis spinous inferior –thisdrives theodontoid
process into the spinal cord.Axis Correction 
Keep the child’s head turned in 
the direction that did not cause a 
leg length or heel tension change. 
Contact under C2 spinouswith 
one hand and the temporal (side 
up). 
Maintain pressure on C2 in a 
superior anterior direction while 
using the temporal contact to 
bring tension at C2. Hold contacts 
till tension resolves. 
Occipital Condyle Adjustment 
This technique is used when tension 
is found on the high occiput side 
with restricted ROM especially on 
side bending or lateral flexion. 
Place your index finger under the 
posterior superior occiput and 
stabilize the temporal and occipital 
bones on the opposite side with 
other hand. 
Rotate your index finger on the 
posterior superior occiput side 
inferior and medial until tissue 
relaxes as you gently use other hand 
to guide the skull on the other side 
slightly lateral and superior.

Step 4: C2-C1 The child is supine. The doctor sits at the head 
of table with their hands to the side of child’s 
head. The ears between index and middle 
fingers. 
The object is to test each vertebral motor unit 
to determine if they are moving correctly. 
Press the head in a straight inferior direction 
through the cervical spine towards the feet. 
Each step should elevate the chin slightly while 
the head remains in the same plane as pressure 
is exerted. The movement should be smooth 
and even. 
Failure of a step to produce motion (locking) or 
skip is positive for a cervical subluxation. If the 
step skips there is hypermobility of the motor 
unit at that level. 
If the step locks there is a fixation subluxation 
at that level. 
For corrective procedures the cervical spine is 
divided into 3 areas: 
Upper Neck
Atlas and Axis –more Rotation on correction 
Middle Neck
C3-C5 –more cervical Extension on correction 
Lower Neck
C6-C7 (occasionally T1) –more Lateral Flexion on 
correction 
OrthobionomyCorrections 
Maintain the head in side-shifted 
position as you apply light pressure 
on the contact point while gently 
curving the neck and head around 
the contact by rotating, side-
bending and extending the head. 
Gently compress the neck into 
contact point and hold for 10-60 
seconds, until a release of tension is 
felt at the contact point or the 
patient reports a 50% or better 
reduction in discomfort at the point. 
Return head to neutral position and 
recheck indicators.

Once these examination procedures have been 
completed the findings must be correlated to 
determine the major type and area of subluxation and 
neurological facilitation before treatment protocols are 
to be applied. 
Specificity especially when dealing with infants is of the 
utmost importance if removal of the neurological 
facilitation is to be accomplished. 
There are specific protocols to help deal more 
efficiently and safely with both the meningeal and 
structural aspects of the subluxation complex.

Until Next Time
Enough for now.  This is a good place for us to stop.  
Plenty of material presented here to get one started with 
pediatric cranial adjusting.
For many of you these are new concepts to add to and shape 
your consciousness and adjusting protocols. 
These cranial procedures are very powerful in making deep-
seated changes to the nervous system of the little ones whose 
care we have been entrusted with.
Please email me any questions or desire for clarification of any of 
the material presented.  I am happy to respond.

CHAPTER 4 Clinical Examination of the Shoulder Complex Michael	
  J.	
  Kissenberth,	
  James	
  F.	
  Silliman,	
  and	
  Richard	
  J.	
  Hawkins	
  Successful	
  management	
  of	
  any	
  clinical	
  problem	
  begins	
  with	
  an	
  accurate	
  history	
  and	
  physical	
  examination.	
  This	
  chapter	
  will	
  describe	
  physical	
  examination	
  of	
  the	
  athlete’s	
  shoulder.	
  Overhead	
  athletes	
  who	
  swim,	
  throw,	
  and	
  serve	
  present	
  with	
  special	
  problems.	
  The	
  extreme	
  forces	
  that	
  act	
  on	
  the	
  shoulder	
  girdle	
  during	
  these	
  activities	
  cannot	
  be	
  re-­‐created	
  in	
  a	
  typical	
  examination.	
  With	
  new	
  technology	
  for	
  assessment,	
  such	
  as	
  motion	
  analysis,	
  we	
  now	
  know	
  that	
  these	
  forces	
  often	
  exceed	
  the	
  physiologic	
  limits	
  of	
  the	
  capsuloligamentous	
  restraints	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  cuff.1	
  If	
  the	
  rate	
  of	
  injury	
  (over-­‐use)	
  exceeds	
  that	
  of	
  repair,	
  impairment	
  and	
  dysfunction	
  result.2	
  As	
  we	
  have	
  advanced	
  in	
  our	
  understanding	
  of	
  the	
  throwing	
  shoulder,	
  we	
  also	
  see	
  loss	
  of	
  internal	
  rotation	
  and	
  pos-­‐terior	
  capsular	
  tightness	
  as	
  an	
  early	
  manifesting	
  symptom.	
  Pain	
  is	
  often	
  the	
  most	
  common	
  manifesting	
  symptom.3	
  The	
  emphasis	
  on	
  the	
  cause	
  of	
  this	
  pain	
  has	
  evolved	
  from	
  biceps3,4	
  and	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  impin-­‐gement	
  tendinitis5-­‐9	
  to	
  anterior	
  instability	
  and	
  posterior	
  capsular	
  tightness,	
  with	
  obvious	
  overlap	
  among	
  these	
  causes	
  in	
  many	
  athletes.	
  Prior	
  to	
  beginning	
  the	
  clinical	
  examination,	
  it	
  is	
  imperative	
  to	
  obtain	
  a	
  chief	
  complaint,	
  an	
  accurate	
  history,	
  and	
  a	
  full	
  understanding	
  of	
  the	
  athlete’s	
  sport,	
  level	
  of	
  participation,	
  position	
  played,	
  motivation,	
  and	
  expectations.	
  For	
  example,	
  a	
  baseball	
  pitcher	
  who	
  has	
  thrown	
  many	
  pitches	
  may	
  have	
  tendinosis,	
  labral	
  tears,	
  or	
  subtle	
  anterior	
  instability.	
  A	
  football	
  player	
  who	
  falls	
  and	
  has	
  a	
  traumatic	
  injury	
  may	
  have	
  dislocated	
  the	
  shoulder	
  or	
  fractured	
  the	
  clavicle.	
  A	
  thor-­‐ough	
  understanding	
  of	
  the	
  initial	
  event	
  or	
  injury	
  is	
  helpful	
  in	
  the	
  initial	
  development	
  of	
  a	
  differential	
  diagnosis.	
  Com-­‐munication	
  with	
  the	
  family	
  and	
  athletic	
  trainer	
  is	
  also	
  helpful	
  in	
  obtaining	
  additional	
  objective	
  information	
  and	
  feed-­‐back	
  regarding	
  the	
  athlete	
  and	
  the	
  injury.	
  It	
  is	
  essential	
  to	
  ask	
  the	
  patient	
  if	
  he	
  or	
  she	
  has	
  had	
  any	
  prior	
  treatment	
  to	
  include	
  periods	
  of	
  rest,	
  injection,	
  physical	
  therapy,	
  and	
  medication.	
  The	
  location	
  and	
  response	
  to	
  the	
  injection	
  can	
  pro-­‐vide	
  valuable	
  information	
  before	
  beginning	
  the	
  examination.	
  Often,	
  the	
  athlete	
  arrives	
  with	
  a	
  magnetic	
  imaging	
  reso-­‐nance	
  (MRI)	
  scan	
  and	
  a	
  presumptive	
  diagnosis	
  based	
  on	
  the	
  MRI	
  reading.	
  Although	
  this	
  is	
  often	
  helpful	
  information,	
  the	
  MRI	
  scan	
  can	
  often	
  lead	
  the	
  physician	
  down	
  the	
  wrong	
  path	
  and	
  should	
  not	
  influence	
  the	
  initial	
  examination.	
  We	
  recommend	
  waiting	
  to	
  review	
  the	
  MRI	
  scan	
  until	
  after	
  the	
  history	
  and	
  examination	
  have	
  been	
  completed.	
  An	
  accurate	
  and	
  thorough	
  examination	
  can	
  only	
  be	
  performed	
  in	
  a	
  relaxed	
  environment.	
  The	
  patient	
  should	
  be	
  clothed	
  so	
  that	
  he	
  or	
  she	
  is	
  relaxed,	
  but	
  the	
  examiner	
  should	
  have	
  adequate	
  visibility	
  of	
  both	
  shoulder	
  girdles	
  and	
  the	
  upper	
  trunk.	
  The	
  examination	
  is	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  patient	
  standing,	
  sitting,	
  supine,	
  or	
  prone,	
  as	
  necessary.	
  The	
  history	
  often	
  influences	
  the	
  clinician	
  to	
  focus	
  on	
  a	
  specific	
  aspect	
  of	
  the	
  examination,	
  but	
  an	
  organized	
  screening	
  examination	
  should	
  be	
  performed	
  on	
  every	
  patient.	
  Because	
  of	
  the	
  interaction	
  of	
  the	
  many	
  factors	
  contributing	
  to	
  the	
  symptom	
  complex	
  in	
  these	
  athletes,	
  it	
  is	
  essential	
  to	
  have	
  a	
  thorough	
  understanding	
  of	
  the	
  entire	
  shoulder	
  girdle,	
  especially	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  and	
  scapulothoracic	
  interplay.	
  The	
  athlete’s	
  shoulder	
  creates	
  many	
  diagnostic	
  dilemmas	
  because	
  of	
  the	
  fine	
  balance	
  between	
  extreme	
  mobility	
  and	
  instability.	
  We	
  suggest	
  an	
  organized,	
  thorough,	
  and	
  consistent	
  format	
  when	
  examining	
  an	
  athlete’s	
  shoulder.	
  Re-­‐creation	
  of	
  the	
  patient’s	
  symptoms	
  with	
  certain	
  maneuvers	
  may	
  help	
  the	
  examiner	
  arrive	
  at	
  an	
  accurate	
  diagnosis.	
  Great	
  variability	
  exists	
  from	
  patient	
  to	
  patient	
  in	
  regard	
  to	
  range	
  of	
  motion,	
  joint	
  laxity,	
  and	
  strength.	
  Often,	
  certain	
  sports	
  require	
  emphasis	
  on	
  different	
  aspects	
  of	
  these	
  facets.	
  For	
  example,	
  gymnastics	
  demands	
  hypermobile	
  or	
  hyperlax	
  joints,	
  and	
  weightlifting	
  demands	
  excess	
  strength.	
  Often,	
  the	
  final	
  question	
  before	
  beginning	
  the	
  examination	
  is	
  to	
  ask	
  the	
  patient	
  to	
  point	
  with	
  one	
  finger	
  and	
  touch	
  the	
  area	
  where	
  the	
  problem	
  is	
  located.	
  The	
  examination	
  proceeds	
  in	
  the	
  following	
  sequence,	
  remembering	
  that	
  presentation	
  can	
  be	
  in	
  the	
  acute	
  setting	
  immediately	
  after	
  an	
  injury	
  or,	
  more	
  often,	
  in	
  a	
  chronic	
  situation	
  presenting	
  to	
  the	
  clinic	
  or	
  office.	
  INITIAL EVALUATION 
Cursory Impression On	
  first	
  visualizing	
  the	
  athlete,	
  an	
  initial	
  cursory	
  impression	
  encompassing	
  many	
  factors	
  is	
  formed.	
  For	
  example,	
  a	
  large	
  muscular	
  individual	
  with	
  a	
  mesomorph	
  frame	
  obviously	
  suggests	
  someone	
  in	
  a	
  strength-­‐type	
  of	
  sport,	
  such	
  as	
  weightlift-­‐ing	
  or	
  football.	
  A	
  petite	
  young	
  woman	
  might	
  well	
  suggest	
  involvement	
  in	
  gymnastics.	
  In	
  analyzing	
  these	
  patients,	
  we	
  may	
  see	
  those	
  who	
  have	
  an	
  acute	
  injury	
  presenting	
  with	
  significant	
  pain,	
  which	
  influences	
  our	
  approach	
  to	
  the	
  situation.	
  The	
  older	
  athlete	
  presenting	
  to	
  the	
  office	
  in	
  a	
  business	
  suit	
  presents	
  a	
  different	
  impression	
  than	
  the	
  6-­‐foot	
  10-­‐inch	
  basketball	
  player	
  who	
  walks	
  into	
  the	
  athletic	
  clinic	
  directly	
  from	
  practice.	
  Inspection Inspection	
  should	
  be	
  performed	
  from	
  different	
  perspectives—that	
  is,	
  from	
  the	
  front,	
  side,	
  back,	
  and	
  top—noting	
  attitude	
  (symme-­‐try),	
  muscles	
  (wasting	
  or	
  hypertrophy),	
  deformities	
  (e.g.,	
  scars,	
  lumps,	
  bumps),	
  any	
  evidence	
  of	
  discoloration	
  such	
  as	
  bruising	
  and	
  swelling.	
  The	
  way	
  the	
  athlete	
  carries	
  the	
  upper	
  trunk	
  and	
  shoulders	
  provides	
  clues	
  as	
  to	
  the	
  diagnosis.	
  For	
  example,	
  an	
  athlete	
  with	
  a	
  painful	
  shoulder	
  may	
  show	
  asymmetry	
  between	
  the	
  trapezius	
  contours	
  when	
  looking	
  from	
  the	
  front	
  and	
  back.	
  Domi-­‐nance	
  may	
  lead	
  to	
  asymmetry	
  between	
  the	
  sizes	
  and	
  contours	
  of	
  the	
  different	
  shoulder	
  girdle	
  muscles.	
  The	
  symmetry	
  of	
  the	
  borders	
  of	
  the	
  clavicle,	
  acromioclavicular	
  joint,	
  and	
  sternoclavicular	
  joints	
  should	
  also	
  be	
  noted.	
  Deformities	
  in	
  these	
  areas	
  are	
  often	
  revealing.	
  Scars	
  should	
  be	
  inspected,	
  not	
  only	
  as	
  evidence	
  of	
  previous	
  surgical	
  procedures,	
  but	
  also	
  for	
  widening	
  or	
  spreading	
  of	
  the	
  scars,	
  which	
  may	
  denote	
  a	
  collagen	
  abnormality,	
  as	
  seen	
  in	
  patients	
  with	
  multidirectional	
  instability.10	
  Evidence	
  of	
  wasting	
  of	
  different	
  muscles	
  or	
  muscle	
  groups	
  may	
  suggest	
  certain	
  diagnoses.	
  Deltoid	
  wasting	
  may	
  appear	
  as	
  prominence	
  and	
  squaring	
  of	
  the	
  acromial	
  borders.	
  Supraspinatus	
  and	
  infraspinatus	
  wasting	
  can	
  be	
  related	
  to	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  tear11	
  or,	
  rarely,	
  to	
  suprascapular	
  nerve	
  injury	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐1).12	
  In	
  particular,	
  infraspinatus	
  atrophy	
  is	
  often	
  a	
  sign	
  of	
  a	
  large	
  ro-­‐tator	
  cuff	
  tear	
  in	
  an	
  older	
  patient;	
  however,	
  in	
  a	
  throwing	
  athlete,	
  a	
  cyst	
  in	
  the	
  spinoglenoid	
  notch	
  causing	
  compression	
  on	
  the	
  suprascapular	
  nerve	
  must	
  be	
  considered.13	
  Occasionally,	
  hypertrophy	
  of	
  a	
  muscle	
  such	
  as	
  the	
  trapezius	
  may	
  be	
  caused	
  by	
  muscle	
  spasm.	
  A	
  patient	
  with	
  a	
  recent	
  injury	
  may	
  have	
  bruising,	
  with	
  associated	
  discoloration.	
  Swelling	
  and	
  discolora-­‐tion	
  are	
  uncommon	
  in	
  chronic	
  complaints	
  but	
  often	
  manifest	
  with	
  acute	
  trauma.	
  Observation Before	
  focusing	
  on	
  range	
  of	
  motion	
  about	
  the	
  shoulder,	
  it	
  is	
  helpful	
  to	
  appreciate	
  glenohumeral	
  and	
  scapulothoracic	
  syn-­‐chrony.	
  Beginning	
  at	
  30	
  degrees	
  of	
  abduction,	
  every	
  30	
  degrees	
  of	
  glenohumeral	
  abduction	
  relate	
  to	
  12	
  deg-­‐rees	
  of	
  scapu-­‐lar	
  rotation.14-­‐16	
  Dyskinesia	
  or	
  asynchrony	
  of	
  this	
  coupled	
  mechanism	
  can	
  be	
  related	
  to	
  loss	
  of	
  range	
  of	
  motion	
  or	
  guarding.	
  Weakness	
  of	
  the	
  scapular	
  stabilizers	
  with	
  resultant	
  scapular	
  winging	
  can	
  be	
  part	
  of	
  the	
  symptom	
  complex	
  of	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  pain,	
  especially	
  in	
  the	
  throwing	
  athlete.	
  It	
  is	
  common	
  for	
  the	
  throwing	
  athlete	
  or	
  patients	
  with	
  subtle	
  forms	
  of	
  multidirectional	
  and	
  posterior	
  instability	
  to	
  have	
  scapular	
  winging.	
  This	
  is	
  usually	
  not	
  related	
  to	
  a	
  neurologic	
  deficit	
  but	
  rather	
  to	
  dyskinesia	
  of	
  the	
  scapulothoracic	
  articulation.	
  From	
  behind	
  the	
  standing	
  patient,	
  the	
  scapulothoracic	
  joint	
  with	
  forward	
  flexion	
  and	
  abduction	
  is	
  observed.	
  Scapular	
  wing-­‐ing	
  can	
  be	
  demonstrated	
  by	
  asking	
  the	
  patient	
  to	
  elevate	
  the	
  arms	
  forward	
  at	
  about	
  half	
  speed,	
  with	
  maximum	
  winging	
  usu-­‐ally	
  demonstrated	
  by	
  applying	
  resistance	
  at	
  about	
  30	
  degrees	
  of	
  forward	
  elevation.	
  The	
  patient	
  can	
  also	
  be	
  asked	
  to	
  perform	
  a	
  wall	
  push-­‐up	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐2).	
  Ligamentous	
  laxity	
  can	
  be	
  observed	
  with	
  extension	
  of	
  the	
  elbow	
  or	
  a	
  thumb-­‐to-­‐forearm	
  examina-­‐tion	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐3).	
  Palpation As	
  noted,	
  it	
  is	
  helpful	
  to	
  ask	
  the	
  patient	
  to	
  point	
  with	
  one	
  finger	
  and	
  touch	
  the	
  area	
  of	
  maximum	
  tenderness.	
  Thorough	
  palpa-­‐tion	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  girdle	
  is	
  now	
  performed,	
  noting	
  warmth,	
  tenderness,	
  deformity,	
  and	
  crepitus.	
  It	
  is	
  often	
  helpful,	
  as	
  confi-­‐dence	
  of	
  the	
  patient	
  is	
  gained,	
  to	
  wait	
  and	
  palpate	
  the	
  area	
  of	
  maximum	
  tenderness	
  at	
  the	
  end	
  of	
  this	
  part	
  of	
  the	
  examination.	
  
Starting	
  from	
  the	
  back,	
  palpation	
  of	
  the	
  cervical	
  spinous	
  processes,	
  scapular	
  spine,	
  medial	
  border	
  of	
  the	
  scapula,	
  and	
  scapular	
  angle	
  may	
  reveal	
  tender	
  areas.	
  Scapulothoracic	
  bursitis	
  at	
  the	
  inferior	
  medial	
  angle	
  of	
  the	
  scapula	
  may	
  manifest	
  in	
  baseball	
  pitchers.17,18	
  Superior	
  angle	
  tenderness	
  and	
  snapping	
  in	
  the	
  tennis	
  serve	
  are	
  common	
  manifesting	
  complaints.	
  The	
  posterior	
  cuff	
  and	
  joint	
  capsule	
  should	
  be	
  palpated	
  deep	
  to	
  the	
  infraspinatus	
  muscle	
  belly.	
  The	
  posterior	
  cuff	
  is	
  often	
  tender,	
  not	
  only	
  with	
  posterior	
  instability	
  but	
  also	
  with	
  internal	
  impingement.13	
  Posterior	
  capsular	
  ossification	
  can	
  lead	
  to	
  significant	
  pain	
  and	
  dysfunction	
  during	
  the	
  throwing	
  motion.19	
  Palpation	
  of	
  the	
  rhomboids,	
  latissimus,	
  supraspinatus,	
  and	
  infraspinatus	
  can	
  pro-­‐vide	
  an	
  assessment	
  of	
  their	
  tone.	
  Palpation	
  of	
  the	
  quadrilateral	
  space	
  below	
  the	
  posterior	
  joint	
  is	
  an	
  important	
  area	
  to	
  localize	
  and	
  palpate,	
  especially	
  in	
  overhead	
  athletes,	
  because	
  of	
  possible	
  compression	
  of	
  the	
  neurovascular	
  structures	
  when	
  the	
  arm	
  is	
  in	
  maximum	
  abduction	
  and	
  external	
  rotation,	
  the	
  cocking	
  position.20	
  The	
  quadrilateral	
  space	
  is	
  bordered	
  by	
  the	
  teres	
  minor	
  superiorly,	
  the	
  teres	
  major	
  inferiorly,	
  the	
  humerus	
  laterally,	
  and	
  the	
  long	
  head	
  of	
  the	
  triceps	
  medially.	
  Clinical	
  findings	
  include	
  vague	
  pain	
  and	
  paresthesias	
  around	
  the	
  shoulder	
  and	
  pinpoint	
  tenderness	
  at	
  the	
  quadrilateral	
  space.	
  From	
  the	
  back,	
  the	
  location	
  of	
  the	
  bicipital	
  tendons	
  can	
  be	
  palpated	
  simultaneously	
  to	
  ascertain	
  tenderness	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐4).	
  The	
  clinician	
  can	
  locate	
  the	
  bicipital	
  groove	
  by	
  directing	
  his	
  or	
  her	
  fingers	
  anteriorly	
  and	
  distally	
  to	
  the	
  acromioclavicular	
  joint,	
  with	
  the	
  patient’s	
  arm	
  in	
  approximately	
  10	
  degrees	
  of	
  internal	
  rotation.	
  Moving	
  to	
  the	
  front	
  of	
  the	
  standing	
  or	
  seated	
  patient	
  and	
  palpating	
  the	
  sternoclavicular	
  joint	
  sta-­‐tically,	
  and	
  with	
  arm	
  rotation,	
  may	
  reveal	
  tenderness,	
  cre-­‐pitus,	
  or	
  even	
  instabil-­‐ity.	
  The	
  clavicle	
  and	
  acromioclavicular	
  joint	
  are	
  also	
  palpated	
  in	
  this	
  way.	
  It	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  palpate	
  the	
  acromion	
  and	
  not	
  to	
  forget	
  about	
  the	
  symptomatic	
  os	
  acromiale.	
  A	
  common	
  injury	
  in	
  the	
  collision	
  athlete,	
  especially	
  in	
  football,	
  is	
  to	
  the	
  acromio-­‐clavicular	
  joint.21	
  Acutely,	
  athletes	
  can	
  present	
  with	
  a	
  wide	
  range	
  of	
  severity	
  of	
  injury	
  and	
  deformity	
  to	
  this	
  joint,	
  with	
  varying	
  degrees	
  of	
  prominence	
  of	
  the	
  outer	
  clavicle.	
  The	
  classification	
  scheme	
  of	
  Rockwood	
  and	
  Green22	
  is	
  useful	
  for	
  appropriate	
  management.	
  Chronic	
  injury	
  to	
  the	
  acromioclavicular	
  joint	
  can	
  lead	
  to	
  hypertrophy,	
  pain,	
  instability,	
  and	
  degenerative	
  joint	
  disease.	
  A	
  symptomatic	
  acromioclavicular	
  (AC)	
  joint	
  is	
  often	
  tender	
  to	
  palpation	
  and	
  the	
  cross-­‐arm	
  adduction	
  test	
  is	
  used	
  as	
  a	
  provocative	
  maneuver	
  to	
  elicit	
  pain	
  at	
  this	
  joint.23	
  The	
  arm	
  is	
  forcibly	
  adducted	
  across	
  the	
  chest	
  wall,	
  producing	
  pain	
  on	
  top	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐5).	
  This	
  test	
  can	
  be	
  positive	
  with	
  labral	
  tears	
  and	
  with	
  cuff	
  pathology,	
  so	
  it	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  have	
  the	
  pa-­‐tient	
  indicate	
  where	
  this	
  test	
  causes	
  pain.	
  Pain	
  felt	
  deep	
  in	
  the	
  shoulder	
  may	
  occur	
  because	
  of	
  a	
  superior	
  labral	
  anterior-­‐posterior	
  (SLAP)	
  tear	
  (see	
  later).	
  The	
  Paxinos	
  test	
  can	
  also	
  help	
  diagnose	
  AC	
  joint	
  pathology.	
  This	
  is	
  accomplished	
  by	
  com-­‐pressing	
  the	
  AC	
  joint	
  with	
  the	
  index	
  finger	
  anterior	
  to	
  the	
  clavicle	
  and	
  the	
  thumb	
  on	
  the	
  posterior	
  edge	
  of	
  the	
  acromion.24	
  In-­‐jection	
  of	
  5	
  mL	
  of	
  1%	
  	
  lidocaine	
  directly	
  into	
  the	
  joint,	
  with	
  relief	
  of	
  the	
  symptomatology	
  in	
  the	
  cross-­‐arm	
  test,	
  can	
  assist	
  in	
  the	
  diagnosis	
  of	
  primary	
  acromioclavicular	
  pathology.	
  The	
  subacromial	
  arch	
  is	
  assessed	
  initially	
  with	
  palpation	
  of	
  the	
  greater	
  tuberosity	
  and	
  supraspinatus	
  insertion	
  (Codman’s	
  point).	
  With	
  circumduction	
  of	
  the	
  arm,	
  an	
  appreciation	
  of	
  the	
  crepitus	
  is	
  important,	
  especially	
  in	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  disease	
  and	
  degenerative	
  joint	
  disease	
  of	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint.	
  A	
  positive	
  clunk	
  test	
  or	
  labral	
  grinding	
  can	
  suggest	
  labral	
  pathology.25	
  Palpable	
  crepitus	
  or	
  grinding,	
  with	
  the	
  arm	
  abducted	
  to	
  90	
  degrees	
  and	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  translated	
  to	
  the	
  anterior	
  rim	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid	
  with	
  a	
  posterior	
  force	
  (prone	
  or	
  seated),	
  and	
  rotation	
  of	
  the	
  arm,	
  is	
  considered	
  positive	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐6).	
  Attention	
  to	
  the	
  contralateral	
  shoulder	
  is	
  also	
  important	
  and	
  useful	
  in	
  palpating	
  painful	
  areas	
  to	
  use	
  as	
  a	
  comparison	
  and	
  to	
  validate	
  clinical	
  findings.	
  There	
  will	
  likely	
  be	
  physiologic	
  adaptations	
  to	
  the	
  throwing	
  shoulder	
  in	
  regards	
  to	
  muscle	
  girth	
  and	
  range	
  of	
  motion	
  (excessive	
  external	
  rotation)	
  that	
  must	
  be	
  taken	
  into	
  account	
  during	
  the	
  examination.	
  Range-of-Motion Assessment The	
  rhythm	
  and	
  synchrony	
  of	
  scapulothoracic	
  and	
  glenohumeral	
  motion	
  have	
  been	
  discussed.	
  Athletes	
  are	
  often	
  selec-­‐tively	
  or	
  generally	
  hypermobile	
  in	
  performing	
  their	
  different	
  movements.	
  For	
  example,	
  accomplished	
  baseball	
  pitchers	
  sometimes	
  show	
  extremes	
  of	
  external	
  rotation	
  at	
  the	
  expense	
  of	
  internal	
  rotation.18	
  However,	
  the	
  total	
  arc	
  of	
  rotation	
  (external	
  rotation	
  plus	
  internal	
  rotation)	
  usually	
  remains	
  similar	
  to	
  that	
  of	
  the	
  contralateral	
  shoulder	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐7).	
  Pathol-­‐ogy	
  and	
  glenohumeral	
  internal	
  rotation	
  deficit	
  (GIRD)	
  may	
  exist	
  if	
  the	
  total	
  arc	
  of	
  motion	
  is	
  25	
  degrees	
  less	
  than	
  that	
  of	
  the	
  contralateral	
  shoulder	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐8).13	
  A	
  pitcher	
  will	
  usually	
  have	
  excessive	
  external	
  rotation	
  and	
  a	
  concomitant	
  loss	
  of	
  
internal	
  rotation.	
  As	
  long	
  as	
  the	
  total	
  arc	
  of	
  motion	
  is	
  similar	
  to	
  that	
  of	
  the	
  contralateral	
  shoulder,	
  an	
  internal	
  rotation	
  deficit	
  does	
  not	
  exist.	
  The	
  quality	
  of	
  the	
  examination	
  is	
  often	
  improved	
  by	
  using	
  a	
  worksheet	
  to	
  record	
  range	
  of	
  motion.	
  Examination	
  for	
  different	
  ranges	
  in	
  different	
  circumstances	
  can	
  be	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  patient	
  standing,	
  sitting,	
  or	
  su-­‐pine,	
  depending	
  on	
  clinician	
  preference.	
  From	
  behind	
  the	
  standing	
  patient,	
  active	
  forward	
  elevation	
  is	
  observed.	
  The	
  patient	
  is	
  allowed	
  to	
  flex	
  his	
  or	
  her	
  arm	
  in	
  the	
  plane	
  that	
  is	
  most	
  comfortable,	
  usually	
  somewhere	
  between	
  the	
  sagittal	
  and	
  scapular	
  planes,	
  and	
  with	
  the	
  thumbs	
  pointing	
  upward	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐9).	
  Once	
  the	
  patient	
  has	
  achieved	
  maximum	
  active	
  range,	
  passive	
  range	
  is	
  assessed	
  by	
  stressing	
  the	
  arm	
  into	
  forward	
  elevation.	
  This	
  represents	
  the	
  classic	
  impingement	
  sign	
  (see	
  later).	
  The	
  passive	
  range	
  is	
  recorded	
  bilaterally	
  in	
  de-­‐grees.	
  External	
  rotation	
  is	
  eva-­‐l-­‐uated	
  with	
  the	
  arm	
  at	
  the	
  side	
  and	
  at	
  90	
  degrees	
  of	
  abduction	
  in	
  much	
  the	
  same	
  manner.	
  Internal	
  rotation	
  is	
  measured	
  by	
  determining	
  where	
  the	
  abducted	
  thumb	
  reaches	
  in	
  reference	
  to	
  spinal	
  vertebrae	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐10).	
  These	
  four	
  motions—forward	
  elevation,	
  external	
  rotation	
  at	
  neutral	
  and	
  90	
  degrees,	
  and	
  internal	
  rotation—should	
  be	
  the	
  motions	
  selected	
  for	
  documentation	
  in	
  the	
  athlete,	
  according	
  to	
  the	
  American	
  Shoulder	
  and	
  Elbow	
  Surgeons	
  (ASES).	
  Strength	
  assessment	
  is	
  described	
  in	
  the	
  next	
  section,	
  but	
  it	
  is	
  determined	
  as	
  range-­‐of-­‐motion	
  testing	
  is	
  performed.	
  Strength Assessment Strength	
  is	
  easy	
  to	
  assess	
  from	
  behind	
  the	
  standing	
  or	
  sitting	
  patient	
  and	
  can	
  be	
  performed	
  in	
  concert	
  with	
  range-­‐of-­‐motion	
  assessment.	
  Unfortunately,	
  the	
  presence	
  of	
  pain	
  may	
  preclude	
  a	
  reliable	
  assessment	
  of	
  strength.	
  The	
  routine	
  strengths	
  to	
  be	
  assessed	
  in	
  the	
  athlete’s	
  shoulder	
  consist	
  of	
  forward	
  elevation,	
  external	
  rotation,	
  internal	
  rotation,	
  and	
  abduction.	
  Strength	
  assessment	
  is	
  performed	
  while	
  testing	
  and	
  comparing	
  the	
  opposite	
  normal	
  side.	
  As	
  with	
  all	
  muscle	
  testing,	
  the	
  muscle	
  being	
  tested	
  should	
  be	
  given	
  the	
  mechanical	
  advantage.	
  All	
  muscle	
  testing	
  should	
  be	
  graded	
  using	
  the	
  0	
  to	
  5	
  rating	
  system	
  (Table	
  4-­‐1).	
  Forward	
  elevation	
  strength	
  (anterior	
  deltoid)	
  is	
  assessed	
  with	
  resistance	
  applied	
  to	
  the	
  forward-­‐flexed	
  arm	
  at	
  approximately	
  70	
  to	
  80	
  degrees.	
  External	
  rotation	
  strength	
  assesses	
  the	
  strength	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  cuff,	
  which	
  contributes	
  30	
  to	
  40	
  degrees	
  of	
  the	
  power	
  of	
  elevation	
  and	
  80%	
  to	
  90%	
  of	
  the	
  power	
  of	
  external	
  rotation.26	
  Abduction	
  strength	
  is	
  also	
  assessed	
  in	
  the	
  coronal	
  plane,	
  and	
  weakness	
  may	
  be	
  suggestive	
  of	
  deltoid	
  or	
  cuff	
  deficiency.	
  At	
  this	
  point	
  in	
  the	
  examination,	
  there	
  is	
  some	
  confluence	
  of	
  testing,	
  because	
  strength	
  tests	
  become	
  part	
  of	
  the	
  special	
  diagnostic	
  tests	
  used	
  to	
  determine	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  pathology,	
  instabil-­‐ity,	
  and	
  overuse	
  throwing	
  conditions.	
  Therefore,	
  specific	
  shoulder	
  muscle	
  tests	
  will	
  be	
  described	
  later	
  in	
  this	
  chapter.	
  IMPINGEMENT AND ROTATOR CUFF PATHOLOGY Impingement	
  syndrome	
  and	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  pathology	
  are	
  common	
  conditions	
  affecting	
  the	
  overhead	
  athlete	
  and	
  can	
  fre-­‐quently	
  result	
  in	
  pain,	
  weakness,	
  instability,	
  or	
  a	
  combination	
  of	
  symptoms.	
  Pain	
  in	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  pathology	
  often	
  involves	
  night	
  pain	
  and	
  difficulty	
  lying	
  on	
  the	
  affected	
  extremity.	
  After	
  completing	
  the	
  initial	
  part	
  of	
  the	
  examination,	
  specific	
  tests	
  can	
  be	
  used	
  to	
  evaluate	
  the	
  integrity	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  musculotendinous	
  structures.	
  The	
  three	
  impingement	
  signs	
  are	
  assessed	
  in	
  forced	
  elevation,	
  forced	
  internal	
  rotation,	
  and	
  the	
  classic	
  painful	
  arc.	
  From	
  the	
  front	
  of	
  the	
  seated	
  or	
  standing	
  patient,	
  passively	
  stressed	
  maximum	
  forward	
  elevation,	
  which	
  elicits	
  pain	
  as	
  the	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  opposes	
  the	
  anterior	
  acromial	
  arch,	
  is	
  the	
  classic	
  Neer’s	
  impingement	
  sign	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐11).6,8	
  The	
  Hawkins	
  sign	
  is	
  elicited	
  by	
  placing	
  the	
  arm	
  in	
  90	
  degrees	
  of	
  forward	
  flexion,	
  with	
  the	
  elbow	
  flexed	
  to	
  90	
  degrees.	
  Pain	
  with	
  forced	
  internal	
  rotation	
  of	
  the	
  arm	
  can	
  be	
  provoked	
  by	
  opposing	
  the	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  on	
  the	
  acromion	
  and	
  coracoacromial	
  ligament;	
  this	
  is	
  an-­‐other	
  impingement	
  sign	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐12).5,27	
  A	
  painful	
  arc	
  in	
  the	
  abducted	
  position	
  in	
  the	
  coronal	
  plane	
  is	
  also	
  an	
  impingement	
  sign.	
  This	
  pain	
  is	
  often	
  increased	
  with	
  resistance	
  and	
  by	
  placing	
  the	
  arm	
  posterior	
  to	
  the	
  plane	
  of	
  the	
  scapula	
  in	
  the	
  coronal	
  plane	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐13).	
  The	
  stressed	
  cross-­‐arm	
  adduction	
  test	
  can	
  be	
  performed	
  and	
  is	
  suggestive	
  of	
  acromioclavicular	
  pathology,	
  as	
  described	
  earlier.	
  Traumatic	
  osteolysis	
  of	
  the	
  distal	
  clavicle	
  seen	
  in	
  weightlifters	
  can	
  manifest	
  with	
  this	
  positive	
  sign,	
  and	
  frequently	
  with	
  signs	
  of	
  impingement.3	
  These	
  signs	
  are	
  88%	
  to	
  92%	
  sensitive,	
  but	
  are	
  all	
  somewhat	
  nonspecific.	
  The	
  yield	
  from	
  the	
  impingement	
  sign	
  is	
  improved	
  by	
  evaluation	
  of	
  an	
  injection	
  test.	
  The	
  subacromial	
  space	
  is	
  injected	
  with	
  
10	
  mL	
  of	
  1%	
  lidocaine,	
  and	
  the	
  impingement	
  tests	
  are	
  repeated.	
  Abatement	
  of	
  pain	
  postinjection	
  suggests	
  subacromial	
  pathology.28	
  It	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  document	
  the	
  percentage	
  of	
  improvement	
  after	
  any	
  injection	
  because	
  it	
  is	
  a	
  prognostic	
  indi-­‐cator	
  for	
  surgery	
  and	
  provides	
  helpful	
  information	
  at	
  follow-­‐up	
  visits.	
  The	
  following	
  tests	
  can	
  evaluate	
  the	
  strength	
  and	
  integrity	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  cuff.	
  They	
  involve	
  standard	
  strength	
  testing	
  of	
  the	
  specific	
  muscles	
  and	
  lag	
  tests	
  to	
  demonstrate	
  weak	
  musculotendinous	
  units.	
  The	
  supraspinatus	
  test,	
  as	
  described	
  by	
  Jobe	
  and	
  Jobe,17	
  isolates	
  and	
  assesses	
  the	
  strength	
  of	
  the	
  supraspinatus	
  tendon	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐14).	
  The	
  strength	
  of	
  elevation	
  is	
  assessed	
  at	
  90	
  degrees	
  of	
  forward	
  flexion	
  in	
  the	
  scapular	
  plane,	
  with	
  the	
  thumbs	
  pointed	
  to	
  the	
  floor.	
  Downward	
  pressure	
  is	
  resisted	
  by	
  the	
  patient.17,29	
  This	
  test	
  is	
  supposedly	
  specific	
  for	
  evaluation	
  of	
  the	
  supraspinatus	
  function	
  and	
  reasonably	
  accurate	
  for	
  assessment	
  of	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  strength	
  and	
  integrity.	
  Unfortunately,	
  many	
  patients	
  have	
  pain,	
  precluding	
  the	
  reliability	
  of	
  such	
  a	
  test.	
  Because	
  this	
  test	
  can	
  be	
  painful,	
  the	
  full	
  can	
  test	
  has	
  been	
  described	
  as	
  an	
  alternative.	
  The	
  thumbs	
  are	
  pointed	
  up	
  and	
  the	
  test	
  is	
  repeated	
  as	
  described	
  for	
  the	
  Jobe	
  test	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐15).	
  Resisted	
  external	
  rotation	
  is	
  then	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  elbows	
  flexed	
  at	
  the	
  sides	
  to	
  assess	
  the	
  strength	
  of	
  the	
  infraspinatus	
  ten-­‐don	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐16).	
  As	
  with	
  all	
  strength	
  tests,	
  the	
  normal	
  shoulder	
  is	
  used	
  as	
  a	
  comparison,	
  and	
  asymmetrical	
  strength	
  is	
  docu-­‐mented	
  and	
  considered	
  a	
  significant	
  finding.	
  An	
  external	
  rotation	
  lag	
  test	
  is	
  used	
  to	
  demonstrate	
  weakness	
  of	
  the	
  infraspinatus	
  and,	
  when	
  positive,	
  is	
  indicative	
  of	
  a	
  significant	
  tear	
  in	
  the	
  musculotendinous	
  unit.	
  This	
  test	
  is	
  accomplished	
  by	
  placing	
  the	
  pa-­‐tient’s	
  shoulder	
  at	
  the	
  side	
  in	
  neutral	
  abduction	
  and	
  externally	
  rotating	
  the	
  forearm;	
  the	
  patient	
  then	
  is	
  asked	
  to	
  hold	
  that	
  posi-­‐tion.30,31	
  With	
  a	
  full-­‐thickness	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  tear	
  or	
  dysfunction	
  involving	
  the	
  supraspinatus	
  and	
  infraspinatus,	
  the	
  forearm	
  will	
  spontaneously	
  rotate	
  back	
  to	
  neutral.	
  This	
  test	
  can	
  also	
  be	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  shoulder	
  in	
  90	
  degrees	
  of	
  elevation	
  in	
  the	
  scapu-­‐lar	
  plane,	
  with	
  the	
  elbow	
  flexed	
  to	
  90	
  degrees;	
  this	
  is	
  called	
  a	
  drop	
  sign.	
  The	
  patient	
  is	
  then	
  asked	
  to	
  maintain	
  this	
  position.	
  The	
  sign	
  is	
  positive	
  if	
  a	
  lag	
  or	
  drop	
  occurs.	
  Gerber	
  has	
  popularized	
  the	
  liftoff	
  test	
  to	
  evaluate	
  subscapularis	
  strength	
  and	
  integrity.	
  The	
  patient	
  is	
  asked	
  to	
  lift	
  the	
  back	
  of	
  his	
  or	
  her	
  hand	
  away	
  from	
  the	
  lumbar	
  spine;	
  this	
  may	
  suggest	
  an	
  intact	
  subscapularis	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐17).	
  If	
  performed	
  properly,	
  this	
  test	
  is	
  reliable	
  to	
  identify	
  a	
  subscapularis	
  rupture;	
  however,	
  the	
  patient	
  will	
  often	
  recruit	
  the	
  triceps,	
  which	
  can	
  lead	
  to	
  a	
  false-­‐negative	
  test	
  result.	
  Technique	
  is	
  critical;	
  it	
  is	
  necessary	
  for	
  the	
  patient	
  to	
  keep	
  the	
  upper	
  arm	
  relaxed	
  while	
  performing	
  the	
  test.	
  There	
  are	
  several	
  variations.	
  The	
  same	
  liftoff	
  test	
  can	
  be	
  performed	
  like	
  a	
  lag	
  test	
  (internal	
  rotation	
  lag	
  sign)	
  by	
  position-­‐ing	
  the	
  patient’s	
  hand	
  away	
  from	
  the	
  small	
  of	
  the	
  back	
  and	
  then	
  asking	
  the	
  patient	
  to	
  hold	
  that	
  position.	
  If	
  the	
  hand	
  spontane-­‐ously	
  returns	
  to	
  the	
  small	
  of	
  the	
  back,	
  it	
  is	
  highly	
  suggestive	
  of	
  subscapularis	
  dysfunction	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐18).	
  The	
  belly	
  press	
  test	
  has	
  been	
  described	
  as	
  an	
  alternative	
  to	
  the	
  liftoff	
  test,	
  especially	
  for	
  patients	
  with	
  internal	
  rotation	
  contractures.20	
  This	
  test	
  is	
  per-­‐formed	
  by	
  having	
  the	
  patient	
  place	
  both	
  hands	
  on	
  the	
  upper	
  abdomen	
  and	
  attempting	
  to	
  keep	
  the	
  arm	
  in	
  maximum	
  internal	
  rotation,	
  with	
  and	
  without	
  resistance.	
  With	
  a	
  normal	
  subscapularis,	
  the	
  elbow	
  stays	
  anterior	
  and	
  does	
  not	
  drop	
  backward	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐19).	
  Both	
  these	
  tests	
  have	
  been	
  validated	
  for	
  the	
  determination	
  of	
  subscapularis	
  integrity	
  and	
  should	
  be	
  parts	
  of	
  all	
  shoulder	
  examinations.	
  BICEPS AND SLAP CONDITIONS Much	
  attention	
  has	
  been	
  given	
  to	
  the	
  biceps	
  and	
  superior	
  labral	
  structures	
  in	
  the	
  throwing	
  athlete	
  recently.	
  There	
  is	
  often	
  a	
  mixed	
  picture,	
  with	
  positive	
  SLAP	
  and	
  biceps	
  findings	
  in	
  patients	
  with	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  problems	
  and	
  those	
  with	
  instability.	
  There-­‐fore,	
  we	
  will	
  describe	
  the	
  tests	
  for	
  extra-­‐articular	
  biceps	
  involvement	
  and	
  intra-­‐articular	
  SLAP	
  tears	
  separately—these	
  tests	
  are	
  performed	
  as	
  part	
  of	
  a	
  comprehensive	
  shoulder	
  examination.	
  Biceps	
  tendon	
  involvement	
  may	
  be	
  evaluated	
  with	
  the	
  tests	
  of	
  Speed	
  and	
  Yergason.29	
  Speed’s	
  test	
  is	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  shoulder	
  in	
  forward	
  flexion,	
  elbow	
  extended,	
  and	
  hand	
  supinated	
  with	
  applied	
  resistance	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐20).	
  Pain	
  in	
  this	
  position	
  from	
  the	
  area	
  of	
  the	
  bicipital	
  groove	
  is	
  a	
  positive	
  finding	
  suggestive	
  of	
  bicipital	
  tendinitis.32	
  Resisted	
  supination	
  with	
  the	
  elbow	
  flexed	
  to	
  90	
  degrees	
  is	
  Yergason’s	
  test.8	
  Once	
  again,	
  pain	
  in	
  the	
  bicipi-­‐tal	
  region	
  with	
  this	
  maneuver	
  is	
  considered	
  positive	
  for	
  biceps	
  tendon	
  involvement	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐21).	
  These	
  are	
  not	
  strength	
  tests	
  and,	
  if	
  positive,	
  are	
  suggestive	
  of	
  extra-­‐articular	
  biceps	
  involvement.	
  An	
  arthroscopic	
  analysis	
  of	
  the	
  Speed’s	
  test	
  has	
  shown	
  a	
  
specificity	
  of	
  14%	
  and	
  a	
  sensitivity	
  of	
  90%.33	
  SLAP	
  lesions	
  have	
  been	
  discussed	
  by	
  Snyder	
  and	
  associates34	
  and	
  several	
  tests	
  were	
  described	
  in	
  an	
  attempt	
  to	
  diagnose	
  tears	
  to	
  the	
  superior	
  labrum	
  on	
  physical	
  exami-­‐nation	
  accurately.	
  As	
  noted,	
  much	
  attention	
  has	
  been	
  given	
  to	
  SLAP	
  tears	
  in	
  baseball	
  pitchers	
  and	
  to	
  understanding	
  the	
  disabled	
  throwing	
  shoulder.	
  Burkhart	
  and	
  colleagues13	
  have	
  advanced	
  our	
  un-­‐derstanding	
  of	
  SLAP	
  tears;	
  they	
  hypothesized	
  that	
  posterior	
  capsular	
  contracture	
  initiates	
  the	
  cascade	
  of	
  events	
  that	
  even-­‐tually	
  lead	
  to	
  a	
  positive	
  peel	
  back	
  of	
  the	
  posterior	
  superior	
  labrum	
  in	
  the	
  late	
  cocking	
  phase	
  of	
  throwing.	
  It	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  evaluate	
  the	
  arc	
  of	
  rotation	
  and	
  loss	
  if	
  internal	
  rotation	
  closely	
  in	
  any	
  thrower,	
  especially	
  those	
  presenting	
  with	
  signs	
  and	
  symptoms	
  of	
  a	
  SLAP	
  tear.	
  The	
  SLAP	
  lesion	
  can	
  also	
  be	
  an	
  acute	
  injury	
  that	
  can	
  be	
  caused	
  by	
  a	
  traction	
  type	
  of	
  injury	
  or	
  a	
  compression-­‐shear	
  type	
  of	
  injury	
  from	
  the	
  humeral	
  head.	
  In	
  general,	
  the	
  examination	
  tests	
  described	
  to	
  identify	
  superior	
  labral	
  lesions	
  attempt	
  to	
  pull	
  on	
  the	
  torn	
  structures	
  with	
  tension	
  and	
  rotation	
  or	
  push	
  on	
  the	
  torn	
  structures	
  with	
  the	
  humeral	
  head.	
  Patients	
  with	
  SLAP	
  tears	
  often	
  complain	
  of	
  a	
  deep	
  pain	
  in	
  the	
  shoulder.	
  The	
  tests	
  are	
  positive	
  if	
  this	
  deep	
  pain	
  is	
  produced	
  during	
  the	
  provocative	
  maneuver.	
  As	
  with	
  all	
  tests,	
  diagnostic	
  injections	
  are	
  critical	
  to	
  confirm	
  the	
  presumed	
  diagnosis.	
  The	
  active	
  compression	
  test	
  described	
  by	
  O’Brien	
  is	
  one	
  of	
  the	
  more	
  commonly	
  performed	
  tests.	
  It	
  is	
  accomplished	
  by	
  standing	
  behind	
  the	
  patient.	
  The	
  patient	
  is	
  asked	
  to	
  forward-­‐flex	
  the	
  arm	
  to	
  90	
  degrees,	
  with	
  the	
  elbow	
  in	
  full	
  extension	
  against	
  resis-­‐tance	
  (Speed’s	
  test).	
  The	
  arm	
  is	
  then	
  adducted	
  10	
  to	
  15	
  degrees	
  medially	
  to	
  the	
  sagittal	
  plane	
  of	
  the	
  body,	
  with	
  the	
  arm	
  inter-­‐nally	
  rotated	
  (thumb	
  down),	
  and	
  resistance	
  is	
  again	
  applied.	
  With	
  the	
  arm	
  in	
  the	
  same	
  position,	
  the	
  test	
  is	
  repeated	
  with	
  the	
  palm	
  facing	
  upward.	
  The	
  test	
  is	
  considered	
  positive	
  if	
  pain	
  is	
  elicited	
  during	
  the	
  maneuver	
  with	
  the	
  thumb	
  pointing	
  down	
  and	
  relieved	
  with	
  the	
  palm	
  facing	
  up	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐22).35	
  This	
  test	
  will	
  often	
  be	
  positive	
  with	
  impingement	
  and	
  with	
  acromioclavicular	
  pathology,	
  so	
  it	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  ask	
  the	
  patient	
  to	
  localize	
  the	
  pain	
  during	
  the	
  test.	
  The	
  results	
  have	
  been	
  shown	
  to	
  be	
  positive	
  in	
  95%	
  of	
  patients	
  with	
  superior	
  labral	
  pathology.	
  Often,	
  we	
  have	
  also	
  found	
  the	
  test	
  positive	
  with	
  other	
  labral	
  pathology.	
  The	
  O’Driscoll	
  SLAP	
  test	
  is	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  patient	
  supine	
  or	
  upright.	
  The	
  shoulder	
  is	
  maximally	
  abducted	
  and	
  exter-­‐nally	
  rotated.	
  From	
  this	
  position,	
  a	
  moving	
  valgus	
  stress	
  is	
  applied	
  in	
  an	
  attempt	
  to	
  push	
  the	
  humerus	
  against	
  the	
  superior	
  labrum.20	
  Pain	
  is	
  considered	
  a	
  positive	
  response.	
  This	
  is	
  similar	
  to	
  the	
  compression-­‐rotation	
  test	
  as	
  described	
  by	
  Snyder	
  and	
  coworkers,34	
  except	
  that	
  the	
  arm	
  is	
  placed	
  in	
  maximum	
  abduction	
  and	
  external	
  rotation.	
  We	
  have	
  found	
  this	
  test	
  to	
  be	
  sensitive	
  but	
  not	
  specific.	
  The	
  crank	
  test,	
  as	
  described	
  earlier,	
  may	
  also	
  be	
  found	
  positive	
  in	
  SLAP	
  tears.	
  There	
  are	
  many	
  alternative	
  SLAP	
  tests	
  and	
  most	
  produce	
  fairly	
  good	
  sensitivities	
  and	
  specificities,	
  but	
  it	
  must	
  be	
  stressed	
  that	
  none	
  of	
  the	
  tests	
  is	
  absolutely	
  diagnostic	
  of	
  a	
  SLAP	
  tear.	
  Any	
  of	
  the	
  positive	
  tests	
  can	
  be	
  repeated	
  after	
  the	
  injection	
  of	
  10	
  mL	
  of	
  1%	
  lidocaine	
  into	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint.	
  Abatement	
  of	
  pain	
  after	
  the	
  injection	
  is	
  further	
  confirmation	
  of	
  intra-­‐articular	
  involvement.	
  The	
  results	
  of	
  these	
  tests,	
  with	
  an	
  accurate	
  history	
  and	
  comprehensive	
  examination,	
  can	
  be	
  helpful	
  in	
  arriving	
  at	
  an	
  accurate	
  diagnosis.	
  GLENOHUMERAL STABILITY ASSESSMENT Glenohumeral	
  instability	
  is	
  assessed	
  by	
  provocative	
  maneuvers,	
  such	
  as	
  an	
  apprehension	
  sign.	
  It	
  is	
  also	
  assessed	
  by	
  trans-­‐lation,	
  anteriorly	
  and	
  posteriorly,	
  of	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  in	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa,	
  as	
  well	
  as	
  inferior	
  translation	
  with	
  a	
  sulcus	
  sign.	
  During	
  these	
  maneuvers,	
  it	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  ask	
  the	
  patient	
  whether	
  there	
  is	
  any	
  reproduction	
  of	
  the	
  symptom	
  complex.	
  It	
  is	
  not	
  uncommon	
  for	
  the	
  throwing	
  athlete	
  to	
  present	
  with	
  shoulder	
  pain	
  and	
  have	
  an	
  underlying	
  degree	
  of	
  subtle	
  ante-­‐rior	
  instability.	
  Similarly,	
  it	
  is	
  not	
  uncommon	
  for	
  the	
  hyperlax	
  and	
  hypermobile	
  patient	
  to	
  have	
  an	
  element	
  of	
  multidirec-­‐tional	
  instability.	
  Many	
  patients	
  also	
  present	
  with	
  arm	
  weakness	
  or	
  heaviness,	
  the	
  so-­‐called	
  dead	
  arm	
  	
  syndrome.36-­‐38	
  Therefore,	
  it	
  is	
  im-­‐perative	
  to	
  consider	
  the	
  patient’s	
  pain	
  symptoms	
  during	
  the	
  examination	
  as	
  an	
  important	
  aspect	
  of	
  any	
  provocative	
  test-­‐ing.	
  Initially,	
  the	
  patient	
  should	
  be	
  as	
  relaxed	
  as	
  possible.	
  It	
  is	
  often	
  prudent	
  to	
  begin	
  the	
  stability	
  assessment	
  with	
  the	
  contra-­‐
lateral	
  or	
  uninvolved	
  shoulder	
  to	
  gain	
  the	
  patient’s	
  confidence	
  during	
  the	
  examination.	
  The	
  stability	
  assessment	
  begins	
  with	
  the	
  load	
  and	
  shift	
  examination.	
  When	
  assessing	
  the	
  amount	
  of	
  translation,	
  it	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  ensure	
  that	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  is	
  initially	
  reduced	
  concentrically	
  into	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa	
  (i.e.,	
  loaded).	
  In	
  patients	
  with	
  significant	
  laxity,	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  may	
  have	
  a	
  resting	
  position	
  that	
  is	
  nonconcentric.	
  Hence,	
  at	
  the	
  commencement	
  of	
  any	
  stress	
  testing,	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  must	
  be	
  grasped	
  and	
  pushed	
  into	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa	
  to	
  ensure	
  its	
  reduction	
  in	
  neutral	
  position.39	
  Once	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  is	
  loaded,	
  directional	
  stresses	
  may	
  be	
  applied.	
  To	
  perform	
  this	
  maneuver,	
  the	
  examination	
  initially	
  involves	
  assess-­‐ment	
  of	
  the	
  patient	
  sitting	
  and	
  the	
  examiner	
  located	
  beside	
  and	
  behind	
  the	
  side	
  to	
  be	
  examined.	
  The	
  examiner	
  places	
  his	
  or	
  her	
  hand	
  over	
  the	
  shoulder	
  and	
  scapula	
  to	
  steady	
  the	
  limb	
  girdle	
  and	
  then,	
  with	
  the	
  opposite	
  hand,	
  grasps	
  the	
  humeral	
  head.	
  As	
  the	
  head	
  is	
  loaded,	
  anterior	
  and	
  posterior	
  stresses	
  are	
  applied	
  and	
  the	
  amount	
  of	
  translation	
  is	
  noted	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐23).	
  Next,	
  the	
  elbow	
  is	
  grasped	
  and	
  inferior	
  traction	
  is	
  applied.	
  The	
  area	
  adjacent	
  to	
  the	
  acromion	
  is	
  observed	
  and	
  dimpling	
  of	
  the	
  skin	
  may	
  indicate	
  a	
  sulcus	
  sign	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐24).	
  A	
  positive	
  sulcus	
  sign	
  may	
  be	
  seen	
  in	
  patients	
  with	
  multidirectional	
  instabil-­‐ity	
  (MDI),	
  but	
  also	
  can	
  be	
  positive	
  in	
  patients	
  with	
  combined	
  labral	
  and	
  rotator	
  interval	
  lesions.	
  It	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  differen-­‐tiate	
  between	
  generalized	
  laxity	
  and	
  instability.	
  A	
  positive	
  test	
  should	
  reproduce	
  the	
  patient’s	
  symptoms.	
  An	
  increased	
  sulcus	
  sign	
  as	
  compared	
  with	
  the	
  asymptomatic	
  shoulder	
  is	
  helpful	
  and	
  should	
  be	
  documented	
  by	
  recording	
  how	
  much	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  is	
  translated	
  inferiorly	
  from	
  the	
  acromion	
  (in	
  millimeters).	
  If	
  a	
  positive	
  sulcus	
  sign	
  is	
  identified,	
  the	
  test	
  should	
  then	
  be	
  repeated	
  with	
  the	
  arm	
  externally	
  rotated	
  20	
  to	
  30	
  degrees;	
  if	
  still	
  positive,	
  it	
  can	
  be	
  suggestive	
  of	
  a	
  rotator	
  interval	
  deficiency.	
  Glenohumeral	
  translation	
  is	
  also	
  assessed	
  with	
  the	
  patient	
  supine.	
  The	
  arm	
  is	
  grasped	
  in	
  the	
  position	
  of	
  approximately	
  20	
  degrees	
  of	
  abduction	
  and	
  forward	
  flexion	
  in	
  neutral	
  rotation.	
  The	
  humeral	
  head	
  is	
  loaded	
  and	
  posterior	
  and	
  anterior	
  stresses	
  are	
  applied.	
  Inferior	
  stress	
  is	
  applied	
  again,	
  noting	
  the	
  sulcus	
  sign	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐25).	
  The	
  accuracy	
  of	
  this	
  test	
  will	
  depend	
  not	
  only	
  on	
  the	
  examiner’s	
  skill	
  but	
  on	
  the	
  ability	
  of	
  the	
  patient	
  to	
  relax.	
  In	
  some	
  patients	
  with	
  associated	
  tendinitis,	
  it	
  is	
  too	
  painful	
  to	
  grasp	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  between	
  the	
  thumb	
  and	
  fingers.	
  In	
  this	
  situation,	
  grasping	
  the	
  upper	
  arm	
  distally	
  to	
  the	
  shoulder	
  may	
  be	
  the	
  only	
  method	
  of	
  assessing	
  translation	
  but	
  is	
  less	
  reliable.	
  It	
  is	
  helpful	
  to	
  have	
  a	
  grading	
  system	
  of	
  translations	
  so	
  that	
  the	
  translation	
  can	
  be	
  understood	
  in	
  relation	
  to	
  any	
  instability	
  pattern	
  that	
  may	
  or	
  may	
  not	
  be	
  present.	
  It	
  is	
  impractical	
  to	
  use	
  distances	
  or	
  percentages.	
  Two	
  important	
  situations	
  may	
  occur	
  during	
  this	
  examination.	
  First,	
  the	
  examiner	
  may	
  feel	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  ride	
  up	
  to	
  the	
  face	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid	
  but	
  not	
  over	
  the	
  rim	
  (grade	
  I).	
  Second,	
  the	
  head	
  may	
  be	
  felt	
  riding	
  over	
  the	
  rim	
  but	
  reduces	
  when	
  the	
  stress	
  is	
  released	
  (grade	
  II).	
  In	
  some	
  cases,	
  at	
  least	
  under	
  anesthesia,	
  once	
  the	
  stress	
  is	
  released,	
  the	
  head	
  sometimes	
  remains	
  dislocated.	
  For	
  purposes	
  of	
  simplicity,	
  this	
  should	
  probably	
  not	
  receive	
  a	
  separate	
  grade.	
  It	
  is	
  important	
  during	
  these	
  maneuvers	
  to	
  ask	
  the	
  patient	
  if	
  this	
  in	
  any	
  way	
  re-­‐produces	
  the	
  symptom	
  complex.	
  If	
  affirmative,	
  this	
  might	
  be	
  a	
  significant	
  clue	
  toward	
  diagnosis	
  and	
  direction	
  of	
  instability,	
  especially	
  for	
  posterior	
  instability.	
  Anterior	
  and	
  posterior	
  drawer	
  tests	
  have	
  also	
  been	
  described.40	
  These	
  are	
  variations	
  of	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  translation	
  test	
  analogous	
  to	
  the	
  Lachman	
  test	
  of	
  the	
  knee.	
  They	
  are	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  patient	
  in	
  the	
  supine	
  position	
  to	
  make	
  measurements	
  more	
  reliable.	
  The	
  affected	
  shoulder	
  is	
  held	
  in	
  80	
  to	
  120	
  degrees	
  of	
  abduction,	
  0	
  to	
  20	
  degrees	
  of	
  for-­‐ward	
  flexion,	
  and	
  0	
  to	
  30	
  degrees	
  of	
  lateral	
  rotation.	
  While	
  pressing	
  the	
  scapular	
  spine	
  forward	
  with	
  counterpressure	
  on	
  the	
  coracoid	
  process,	
  the	
  relative	
  movement	
  between	
  the	
  fixed	
  scapula	
  and	
  the	
  moveable	
  humerus	
  can	
  be	
  appreci-­‐ated.	
  Occasionally,	
  a	
  positive	
  grind	
  test	
  can	
  be	
  felt	
  during	
  this	
  maneuver,	
  noting	
  labral	
  path-­‐ology.	
  The	
  posterior	
  drawer	
  test	
  is	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  elbow	
  at	
  120	
  degrees	
  of	
  flexion	
  and	
  the	
  shoulder	
  in	
  80	
  to	
  120	
  degrees	
  of	
  abduction	
  and	
  20	
  to	
  30	
  degrees	
  of	
  forward	
  flexion.	
  Again,	
  the	
  scapula	
  is	
  stabilized,	
  and	
  a	
  posterior	
  directed	
  force	
  is	
  placed	
  on	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  with	
  the	
  thumb.	
  Significant	
  expansion	
  of	
  information	
  about	
  the	
  athlete’s	
  shoulder	
  has	
  come	
  from	
  advances	
  in	
  arthroscopy.41	
  During	
  arthro-­‐scopy,	
  particularly	
  under	
  general	
  anesthesia,	
  an	
  appreciation	
  of	
  glenohumeral	
  translation	
  can	
  be	
  obtained.	
  This	
  is	
  some-­‐times	
  important	
  when	
  completing	
  the	
  examination	
  of	
  the	
  athlete	
  who	
  has	
  a	
  confusing	
  diagnosis	
  and	
  has	
  arrived	
  at	
  the	
  stage	
  of	
  surgical	
  reconstruction.42	
  
The	
  next	
  phase	
  of	
  stability	
  assessment	
  is	
  to	
  attempt	
  re-­‐production	
  of	
  the	
  symptom	
  complex	
  by	
  eliciting	
  appre-­‐hension	
  with	
  certain	
  provocative	
  positions	
  of	
  impending	
  subluxation	
  or	
  dislocation.	
  This	
  is	
  especially	
  applicable	
  for	
  anterior	
  insta-­‐bility.	
  The	
  apprehension	
  test	
  is	
  an	
  evaluation	
  of	
  the	
  patient’s	
  sense	
  of	
  pending	
  anterior	
  subluxation	
  or	
  dislocation	
  with	
  the	
  arm	
  in	
  stressed	
  external	
  rotation	
  abduction.38,43	
  The	
  role	
  of	
  pain	
  needs	
  to	
  be	
  interpreted,	
  because	
  frequently	
  a	
  patient	
  may	
  not	
  be	
  apprehensive	
  in	
  this	
  position	
  but	
  may	
  only	
  experience	
  pain.	
  The	
  usual	
  position	
  of	
  the	
  arm	
  when	
  subluxation	
  or	
  dis-­‐location	
  occurs	
  is	
  abduction	
  in	
  external	
  rotation.	
  The	
  apprehension	
  test	
  for	
  anterior	
  instability	
  can	
  be	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  patient	
  in	
  the	
  supine	
  or	
  seated	
  position,	
  although	
  maximum	
  muscle	
  relaxation	
  is	
  best	
  achieved	
  with	
  the	
  patient	
  supine.	
  With	
  the	
  patient	
  sitting,	
  the	
  examiner	
  stands	
  behind	
  the	
  shoulder	
  to	
  be	
  examined.	
  To	
  assess	
  the	
  patient’s	
  left	
  shoulder,	
  the	
  examiner	
  raises	
  the	
  patient’s	
  arm	
  to	
  90	
  degrees	
  of	
  abduction	
  and	
  begins	
  to	
  rotate	
  the	
  humerus	
  externally.	
  The	
  right	
  hand	
  of	
  the	
  examiner	
  is	
  placed	
  over	
  the	
  humeral	
  head,	
  with	
  the	
  thumb	
  pushing	
  from	
  posterior	
  for	
  extra	
  leverage	
  and	
  with	
  the	
  fingers	
  anterior	
  to	
  control	
  for	
  any	
  sudden	
  instability	
  episode	
  that	
  may	
  occur	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐26).	
  With	
  increasing	
  external	
  rotation	
  and	
  controlled	
  general	
  forward	
  pressure	
  exerted	
  against	
  the	
  humeral	
  head,	
  an	
  impending	
  feeling	
  of	
  anterior	
  instability	
  may	
  be	
  produced—an	
  apprehension	
  sign.	
  An	
  apprehensive	
  look	
  may	
  appear	
  on	
  the	
  patient’s	
  face	
  as	
  he	
  or	
  she	
  contracts	
  his	
  or	
  her	
  muscles	
  to	
  prevent	
  dislocation	
  or,	
  if	
  the	
  stress	
  is	
  continued,	
  he	
  or	
  she	
  may	
  volunteer	
  that	
  the	
  shoulder	
  feels	
  like	
  it	
  will	
  come	
  out.	
  Pain	
  alone	
  is	
  not	
  a	
  positive	
  apprehension	
  sign,	
  although	
  it	
  is	
  often	
  present.	
  The	
  apprehension	
  test	
  can	
  be	
  repeated	
  with	
  the	
  patient	
  supine	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐27).	
  The	
  shoulder	
  to	
  be	
  examined	
  is	
  positioned	
  so	
  that	
  the	
  scapula	
  is	
  supported	
  by	
  the	
  edge	
  of	
  the	
  exam-­‐ining	
  table	
  and	
  the	
  proximal	
  humerus	
  is	
  then	
  stressed	
  in	
  varying	
  degrees	
  of	
  abduction	
  and	
  external	
  rotation,	
  again	
  attempting	
  to	
  reproduce	
  impending	
  instability.	
  In	
  the	
  supine	
  position,	
  the	
  body	
  acts	
  as	
  a	
  counterweight.	
  The	
  edge	
  of	
  the	
  table	
  serves	
  as	
  the	
  fulcrum	
  and	
  the	
  arm	
  as	
  the	
  lever.	
  When	
  the	
  appre-­‐hensive	
  position	
  is	
  located,	
  note	
  is	
  taken	
  of	
  the	
  amount	
  of	
  external	
  rotation.	
  With	
  the	
  arm	
  in	
  this	
  position,	
  a	
  posterior	
  stress	
  may	
  be	
  exerted	
  on	
  the	
  proximal	
  humerus	
  and	
  the	
  apprehension	
  may	
  disappear,	
  allowing	
  external	
  rotation	
  before	
  emergence	
  of	
  the	
  apprehension	
  sign.	
  The	
  relocation	
  test	
  can	
  be	
  done	
  and	
  has	
  two	
  possible	
  results—at	
  the	
  apprehension	
  point,	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  is	
  subluxated	
  slightly	
  and	
  pushing	
  it	
  posteriorly	
  causes	
  reduction,	
  or	
  the	
  posteriorly	
  directed	
  pressures	
  act	
  as	
  a	
  supportive	
  buttress	
  ante-­‐riorly	
  to	
  give	
  the	
  patient	
  more	
  confidence,	
  preventing	
  apprehension	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐28).	
  The	
  relocation	
  test	
  was	
  originally	
  described	
  in	
  the	
  presence	
  of	
  pain	
  only	
  and	
  not	
  with	
  apprehension.	
  A	
  positive	
  relocation	
  test	
  for	
  pain	
  located	
  in	
  the	
  posterior	
  aspect	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  is	
  suggestive	
  of	
  internal	
  impingement	
  between	
  the	
  posterosuperior	
  labrum	
  and	
  infraspinatus	
  tendon.	
  This	
  is	
  an	
  important	
  differentiation	
  because	
  the	
  problem	
  is	
  likely	
  the	
  result	
  of	
  posterior	
  capsular	
  tightness	
  and	
  not	
  anterior	
  insta-­‐bility.	
  The	
  positive	
  relocation	
  test	
  allows	
  greater	
  external	
  rotation	
  in	
  the	
  abducted	
  position,	
  with	
  less	
  pain.	
  If	
  the	
  arm	
  is	
  suddenly	
  released	
  when	
  stressed	
  with	
  external	
  rotation	
  and	
  abduction,	
  the	
  patient	
  has	
  a	
  substantial	
  increase	
  in	
  pain,	
  which	
  may	
  be	
  referred	
  to	
  as	
  a	
  release	
  test.	
  This	
  may	
  be	
  caused	
  by	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  jumping	
  forward	
  on	
  release	
  of	
  the	
  posteriorly	
  applied	
  stress.	
  The	
  pain	
  can	
  also	
  be	
  augmented	
  with	
  external	
  rotation	
  and	
  abduction	
  by	
  pulling	
  forward	
  on	
  the	
  back	
  of	
  the	
  arm	
  (augmentation	
  test).	
  These	
  findings	
  may	
  be	
  present	
  but	
  are	
  not	
  necessarily	
  related	
  to	
  nor	
  represent	
  the	
  classic	
  apprehension	
  sign.	
  Their	
  value,	
  however,	
  is	
  in	
  the	
  differentiation	
  of	
  impingement	
  or	
  anterior	
  subluxation	
  as	
  the	
  source	
  of	
  pain.	
  Posterior	
  instability	
  may	
  present	
  with	
  subluxation	
  rather	
  than	
  dislocation.	
  Pain	
  may	
  also	
  be	
  a	
  contributing	
  factor.	
  Most	
  patients	
  can	
  demonstrate	
  the	
  position	
  that	
  reproduces	
  their	
  symptoms.	
  Having	
  ascertained	
  the	
  compromising	
  maneuver,	
  the	
  examiner	
  may	
  attempt	
  to	
  reproduce	
  the	
  instability	
  by	
  manually	
  duplicating	
  the	
  stresses.	
  Because	
  this	
  is	
  usually	
  a	
  pain-­‐less	
  subluxation	
  that	
  easily	
  reduces,	
  posterior	
  apprehension	
  is	
  not	
  commonly	
  present	
  and,	
  therefore,	
  is	
  not	
  a	
  reliable	
  sign.	
  With	
  posterior	
  stresses,	
  patients	
  who	
  are	
  painful	
  may	
  resist,	
  which	
  is	
  sometimes	
  erroneously	
  interpreted	
  as	
  apprehension.	
  The	
  Jahnke	
  or	
  jerk	
  test,	
  when	
  positive,	
  is	
  excellent	
  for	
  diagnosing	
  posterior	
  instability	
  patterns.	
  The	
  examiner	
  adducts	
  and	
  internally	
  rotates	
  the	
  shoulder	
  and	
  then	
  applies	
  a	
  posterior	
  stress.	
  If	
  unstable,	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  will	
  subluxate	
  posteriorly.	
  Next,	
  the	
  shoulder	
  is	
  brought	
  back	
  from	
  horizontal	
  adduction	
  while	
  maintaining	
  a	
  posterior	
  force	
  on	
  the	
  humerus	
  from	
  the	
  elbow.	
  As	
  the	
  shoulder	
  returns	
  to	
  neutral,	
  a	
  clunk	
  or	
  visible	
  reduction	
  may	
  be	
  felt	
  and	
  heard	
  as	
  the	
  
shoulder	
  reduces	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐29).20	
  In	
  posterior	
  instability,	
  the	
  patient	
  who	
  cannot	
  demonstrate	
  the	
  instability	
  may	
  present	
  a	
  diagnostic	
  challenge.	
  It	
  is	
  not	
  uncommon	
  for	
  the	
  patient	
  only	
  to	
  demonstrate	
  pain	
  on	
  posterior	
  stress	
  testing	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder,	
  without	
  any	
  obvious	
  translational	
  abnormalities.	
  This	
  subset	
  of	
  patients	
  may	
  have	
  only	
  a	
  labral	
  tear,	
  without	
  significant	
  capsular	
  redundancy.	
  At	
  times,	
  a	
  click	
  may	
  be	
  felt	
  on	
  posterior	
  stress	
  testing	
  suggesting	
  a	
  posterior	
  labral	
  tear.	
  Therefore,	
  pain	
  reproducing	
  the	
  patient’s	
  symptoms	
  may	
  provide	
  the	
  only	
  diagnostic	
  clue.	
  Patients	
  with	
  inferior	
  instability	
  may	
  state	
  that	
  the	
  distal	
  traction	
  on	
  the	
  arm	
  reproduces	
  their	
  symptom	
  complex,	
  suggesting	
  underlying	
  mu-­‐ltidirectional	
  instability.44,45	
  Comparison	
  with	
  the	
  contralateral	
  extremity	
  is	
  always	
  performed	
  following	
  the	
  examina-­‐tion.	
  	
  NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION Any	
  athlete	
  who	
  presents	
  with	
  shoulder	
  pain	
  and/or	
  weakness	
  should	
  have	
  a	
  thorough	
  neurologic	
  examination.	
  It	
  is	
  how-­‐ever,	
  common	
  for	
  many	
  athletes	
  who	
  throw,	
  swim,	
  and	
  serve	
  to	
  present	
  with	
  dysesthesias	
  in	
  their	
  extremities.	
  For	
  exam-­‐ple,	
  this	
  is	
  a	
  common	
  presentation	
  with	
  instability	
  patterns.	
  The	
  timing	
  of	
  performing	
  a	
  neurologic	
  examination	
  may	
  vary.	
  It	
  is	
  frequently	
  helpful	
  to	
  carry	
  out	
  the	
  examination	
  during	
  range-­‐of-­‐motion	
  as-­‐sessment	
  because	
  strength	
  testing	
  is	
  done	
  almost	
  concurrently,	
  and	
  it	
  seems	
  appropriate	
  to	
  complete	
  the	
  sensory	
  and	
  reflex	
  examinations	
  at	
  that	
  time.	
  Normally,	
  a	
  dermatomal	
  sensory	
  examination	
  is	
  performed	
  in	
  the	
  usual	
  manner.	
  Deep	
  tendon	
  reflexes	
  at	
  the	
  elbow	
  and	
  wrist	
  are	
  noted.	
  Evaluation	
  of	
  muscle	
  mass	
  and	
  tone,	
  and	
  strength,	
  is	
  performed	
  during	
  the	
  palpation	
  part	
  of	
  the	
  examina-­‐tion.	
  The	
  addition	
  of	
  evaluation	
  of	
  wrist	
  extension,	
  finger	
  abduction	
  and	
  adduction,	
  thumb	
  abduction,	
  and	
  elbow	
  extension	
  can	
  provide	
  a	
  quick	
  assessment	
  of	
  the	
  health	
  of	
  the	
  cervical	
  roots.	
  Cervical	
  spine	
  radiculopathy	
  can	
  mimic	
  that	
  of	
  intrinsic	
  shoulder	
  disease	
  (e.g.,	
  C5	
  radiculopathy	
  can	
  mimic	
  a	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  tear).46-­‐48	
  Spurling’s	
  test	
  is	
  helpful	
  to	
  determine	
  cervical	
  disease	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐30).	
  The	
  neck	
  is	
  flexed	
  and	
  rotated	
  to	
  one	
  side,	
  with	
  corresponding	
  compression	
  to	
  elicit	
  pain.49	
  In	
  the	
  absence	
  of	
  tenderness	
  of	
  the	
  posterior	
  cervical	
  spinous	
  processes	
  to	
  pal-­‐pation,	
  and	
  in	
  the	
  presence	
  of	
  a	
  negative	
  Spurling’s	
  test,	
  cervical	
  spine	
  pathology	
  and	
  radiculopathy	
  can	
  usually	
  be	
  ex-­‐cluded.	
  VASCULAR EXAMINATION The	
  vascular	
  examination	
  consists	
  of	
  palpation	
  of	
  the	
  pulses	
  at	
  the	
  wrist	
  and	
  elbow,	
  along	
  with	
  an	
  assessment	
  of	
  vascular	
  changes	
  from	
  dystrophy,	
  such	
  as	
  swelling,	
  discoloration,	
  and	
  lack	
  of	
  sweating.	
  There	
  are	
  also	
  tests	
  to	
  determine	
  thoracic	
  out-­‐let	
  syndrome.	
  Adson’s	
  maneuver	
  is	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  shoulders	
  extended,	
  breath	
  held,	
  neck	
  extended,	
  and	
  chin	
  turned	
  to	
  the	
  same	
  side.	
  The	
  arm	
  is	
  in	
  a	
  slightly	
  abducted	
  and	
  extended	
  position.	
  Diminution	
  of	
  a	
  palpable	
  pulse	
  at	
  the	
  wrist	
  is	
  consid-­‐ered	
  positive	
  for	
  thoracic	
  outlet	
  syndrome	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐31).	
  Other	
  thoracic	
  outlet	
  tests	
  are	
  less	
  reliable;	
  perhaps	
  the	
  most	
  helpful	
  is	
  provocative	
  testing.	
  The	
  Roos	
  test	
  is	
  performed	
  with	
  the	
  patient	
  standing	
  or	
  sitting,	
  with	
  both	
  shoulders	
  in	
  abduction	
  and	
  external	
  rotation.	
  With	
  the	
  arms	
  above	
  the	
  head,	
  the	
  patient	
  is	
  asked	
  to	
  open	
  and	
  close	
  each	
  fist	
  repetitively	
  to	
  reproduce	
  the	
  symptoms	
  distal	
  to	
  the	
  forearm	
  (Fig.	
  4-­‐32).50	
  This	
  often	
  causes	
  an	
  aching	
  fatigue,	
  suggestive	
  of	
  thoracic	
  outlet	
  syndrome.	
  SUMMARY Athletes	
  with	
  shoulder	
  injuries	
  often	
  present	
  a	
  diagnostic	
  dilemma.	
  If	
  the	
  examiner	
  systematically	
  approaches	
  the	
  history	
  to	
  classify	
  the	
  patient	
  as	
  having	
  specific	
  symptom	
  patterns	
  and	
  performs	
  a	
  thorough	
  physical	
  examination,	
  paying	
  particular	
  attention	
  to	
  how	
  the	
  assessment	
  relates	
  to	
  the	
  patient’s	
  symptomatology,	
  an	
  accurate	
  diagnosis	
  can	
  usually	
  be	
  made.	
  Spe-­‐cifically,	
  the	
  initial	
  event	
  or	
  injury	
  is	
  a	
  critical	
  aspect	
  of	
  the	
  history	
  and	
  a	
  thorough	
  understanding	
  is	
  helpful	
  before	
  beginning	
  the	
  examination.	
  Management	
  techniques	
  are	
  obviously	
  predicated	
  on	
  an	
  accurate	
  diagnosis.	
  Often,	
  patients	
  can	
  relate	
  the	
  exact	
  mechanism	
  of	
  injury	
  and	
  actually	
  have	
  a	
  clear	
  understanding	
  of	
  their	
  symptom	
  pattern.	
  However,	
  with	
  increasing	
  de-­‐mands	
  from	
  an	
  athletic	
  population,	
  many	
  patients	
  present	
  with	
  unclear	
  histories	
  of	
  their	
  symptoms.	
  The	
  importance	
  of	
  us-­‐
ing	
  injections	
  and	
  comparing	
  with	
  the	
  asymptomatic	
  shoulder	
  to	
  confirm	
  examination	
  findings	
  cannot	
  be	
  overstated.	
  If	
  care	
  is	
  taken	
  during	
  the	
  examination	
  to	
  be	
  thorough	
  and	
  organized,	
  the	
  correct	
  diagnosis	
  can	
  be	
  reached.

Sports Medicine Update

Current Concepts In 
Concussion






Objectives
To give most recent deﬁnition of concussion

Epidemiology/Pathophysiology of Concussion

To discuss history clues in the ofﬁce treatment of the concussed athlete

To  discuss the physical examination clues in the ofﬁce treatment of the concussed athlete

To discuss new treatment modalities and return to play criteria
Introduction
Most common head injury in athletics.

1.4 million ER visits/yr; over $60 billion

More than 90% of mTBI do not result in loss of consciousness.

In the US, 1.7 million suffer mTBI annually

Estimated 250,000 to 2.25 million more cases unidentiﬁed each year.
Injury Rate per 1000 athletes exposed
 Football (2.34)  

 Men’ s Ice Hockey (1.47)  

 Women’ s Soccer (1.42) 

 Wrestling (1.27)

 Men’ s Soccer (1.08) 

 Women’ s Lacrosse (0.70)

 Field Hockey (0.57) 

 Women’ s Basketball (0.50)

 Men’ s Basketball (0.32) 

 Softball (0.25)  

 Baseball (0.19) 

 Volleyball (0.15) 

History
First descriptions over 3000 yrs ago

Hippocrates:

“falls down immediately, loses speech, cannot see or hear.”

Constellation of symptoms a mystery

Derived from the latin verb “concutere” meaning “to shake violently”  1400 AD


Deﬁnition
Previous deﬁnitions of concussion limited in ability to truly deﬁne the symptoms of concussion.

!
Previous deﬁnitions and grading systems were unable to include minor impact injuries that result in persistent physical and/or cognitive symptoms.

Deﬁnition !!
“Concussion: a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by traumatic biomechanical forces.  Several common features that incorporate clinical, pathological, and biomechanical injury constructs that may be used to deﬁne concussive head injury include the following:”

 Caused either by a direct blow to the head, face, neck, or elsewhere on the body with an “impulsive” force transmitted to the head.

  Typically results in the rapid onset of short-lived impairment of neurological function that resolves spontaneously.    
Deﬁnition 
  May result in neuropathological changes, but the acute clinical symptoms largely reﬂect a functional disturbance rather than structural injury.

  Results in a graded set of clinical symptoms  that may or may not involve loss of consciousness.  

  Typically associated with grossly normal structural neuroimaging studies.  

  Resolution of the clinical and cognitive symptoms typically follows a sequential course that may last from several minutes, to days, weeks, months, or even longer in some cases.     -CDC Physicians Toolkit Collins, et al. 2006

Biomechanics 
 due to an abrupt linear and/or rotational  acceleration or deceleration of the brain within the skull causing axonal injury

Linear Acceleration
Caused by sudden change in velocity occurring in a straight line 

Results from a direct hit straight in head’ s line of center

causes focused area of damage 

Coup/Contra-coup 


Rotational/Angular Accleration
Blow that is off-set from midline, causing rotational vector force neck/brain

Often greater surface area of brain affected

Results from hits often not seen

More deleterious due to laxity of cervical muscles “pendulum effect”

If head could spin freely, head would spin up to 916 revolutions/sec every sec at the force needed to sustain concussion

Biomechanics
Broglio, et al. study 2010

Studied 57,000 impacts HS football players

range of linear acceleration causing concussion ranged from 74.0g to 146.0g (g=force of gravity), and the angular accelerations ranged from 5,582.6 radians/s2 to 9,515.6 rad/s2

it was determined that an angular acceleration of >5,582 rad/s2 and a linear acceleration of >96.1g yielded the highest predictive value of concussion.

Hockey players can hit 17% harder than football players while having 20% less mass

Biomechanics
Originally thought cervical muscle strength was a preventative mechanism against concussion

Now newer thought may be that neck/muscle stiffness is better protective mechanism due to decrease angular acceleration of brain

May be reason why “tackler” rarely gets injured vs. player struck 
Biomechanics
Henlon (2011), Shewchenko (2005)

intentional heading scenarios in soccer demonstrate cranial accelerations well below the concussion threshold ranges found in the football studies discussed above. 

For example, a study of girls youth soccer (under age 14) showed a mean linear acceleration of 20.4 g (range 4.5g to 62.9g) and a mean rotational acceleration of 1,940 rad/s2 during intentional headers. A separate study concluded that intentional heading scenarios in soccer have low impact accelerations, not exceeding 19.8g.






Pathophysiology Concussion Anyway?
Due to a reversible neurologic cellular metabolic deﬁcit rather than cell death

Caused by a VERY complex neurological and biochemical cascade caused by trauma to brain

Pathophysiology of Concussion

characteristic ionic ﬂuxes, acute metabolic changes, and cerebral blood ﬂow alterations occur immediately after cerebral trauma

Extracellular potassium concentration can increase massively in the brain after concussion, followed by hypermetabolism lasting up to ten days or more. 

This makes the brain more vulnerable and susceptible to death after a second trauma insult of even less intensity. 

Fisher and Vaca (2001):  study concluded when the patient sustains a “second impact,” the brain loses its ability to auto regulate intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures. 

Second Impact Syndrome
Emergent intervention needed

Death can occur within minutes in severe cases

Management includes emergent craniotomy

Permanent neurologic deﬁcits can result

Challenges to Management
No imaging techniques or biomarkers available to diagnose injury

Variability  in management recommendations

Lack of targeted clinical and treatment pathways

“Rest” does not cure all concussions

Lack of well controlled, prospective studies on long-term outcomes

Media hysteria driving public perception

“Self-reports” predicting management directive
Challenges
Each concussion is as unique as the individual

Factors affecting concussion:

Age/sex

Increased in females/young age

Children up to 40x more sensitive to glutamate

Young brain not fully myelinated until 23 yo

Hit/Trauma different in each case

Skeletal Maturity/Skull Size thickness

!!
The adolescent brain recovers slower than the adult brain

!
If an athlete has had a concussion, they are 4-6 times more likely to have a second
Key Historical Points
Subsequent hits, although lesser in nature, may produce worse symptoms

!
Thus, a complete history of past concussions, with emphasis on LOC and type of amnesia is critical

!
Athletes with co-morbid migraine headache history or associated ADHD/learning disabilities may need special consideration
Key Historical Questions
How many head injuries has the patient had in the past?

How did they occur?

What type of symptoms did they have?

How long did the symptoms last?

Were they associated with LOC or amnesia, and what type?
Key Historical Questions
Do they have a pressure HA and does it get worse with school, reading, note taking, exertion?

Where is the HA? Similar to previous migraines?

Do they get dizzy with movement/car rides/crowded places (malls, supermarkets)?

Do they get fatigued at a certain point in the day?

Are they more sensitive to light/noise?

Are they more distracted?

Are they have trouble falling/staying asleep?

Are they more moody/irritable?
Key Historical Questions
Do they feel “foggy”?

How many practices/competitions did they miss?

Did the symptoms affect classes and their grades?

How long did it take them to “feel themselves”?

Did they have any “dings” or hits to chest, neck, or face that radiated to head that were unreported as concussion?

Education
Imperative that coaches, players and parents understand the medical issues involved in concussion.
Athletes must know of consequences of premature return of play.
Athletes must also know that not every concussion results in automatic removal from sports.

Good sites for athletes to check for understanding of concussion.
Imaging
Zurich International Concussion Conference (2012)  recognized that conventional neuroimaging is usually normal and unwarranted.

Encouraged to utilize in cases where there is suspicion of cerebral bleed, prolonged disturbance of conscious state, focal neurological deﬁcit, seizure activity or persistent clinical or cognitive symptoms.

CT is gold standard (R/O bleed, etc)

Imaging
Additional Neuroimaging Considerations

MRI

Use of gradient echo, perfusion and diffusion weighted images better choice to distinguish structural brain abnormalities

PET Scan/Functional MRI

Used often in concussion research but not yet standard of care

Diffusion tensor imaging

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy

Functional connectivity
Imaging
fMRI
Administration of MRI while patient undergoes cognitive challenge
Measures brain activity by changes in blood ﬂow
See signaling in dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex corresponding to memory centers of brain
These areas often correspond with areas with altered brain metabolism seen with concussion research studies

Summary
Concussion is an incredibly complex injury that encompasses cognitive, visual, and vestibular aspects of the brain as well alter mood and sleeping patterns.

It is indeed a traumatic injury to the brain causing an energy/metabolic crisis.

It involves more than “rest”: multi-faceted approach is the key to effective treatment.

Newer advances are emerging in treatment.

DEMO BILLING DOS AND DON’TS 
 
 
 
• DO separate “demo” claims from spinal CMT claims 
  
 When billing for the Medicare Demonstration Projec t (MDP), you must file MDP-covered services on a 
 separate claim form from spinal manipulation servic es (98940-98942).  As for non-covered services, it is 
 recommended that they be put on the spinal CMT form.  If you bill demo services on the same form as 
 non-demo services, YOU WILL NOT BE PAID . 
  
• DO put “Demo 45” in Box 19 for demo claims 
 If you do NOT have the words Demo 45  in Box 19 on demo claims [REF02 (REF01=P4) in the 2300 loop 
 for electronic claims), YOU WILL NOT BE PAID . 
  
• DO NOT put “Demo 45” in Box 19 for spinal CMT (98940-98942) claims 
  If you DO have the words Demo 45  in Box 19 on spinal CMT claims, YOU WILL NOT BE PAID . 
 
 
• DO use the AT modifier on ALL services that are NOT Maintenance Care 
 
 If you do not append the AT modifier to non-maintenance services under the MDP, YOU WILL NOT BE 
 PAID . 
  
• DO use the GP modifier when billing therapy services 
 
 If you bill therapy services without the GP modifier, YOU WILL NOT BE PAID . 
 
 
• DO use the GY modifier on therapies, if performed by a CA 
  If a CA is providing therapy, the service(s) must  be billed on the “regular” Medicare claim (with the 
 spinal CMT services) and have a GY modifier appended (e.g., 97035 GPGY).  If a physician or PT 
 provides the therapy, the service is reimburs able; however, if a CA provides the therapy, YOU WILL NOT 
 BE PAID . 
 
 
• DO use G0283 instead of 97014 when billing for unattended/supervised estim 
 
 If you use 97014 to indicate unattended/ supervised electrical stimulation, YOU WILL NOT BE PAID . 
  
• DO complete Box 32 unless services are provided at patient’s home 
   If you use any Place of Service code OTHER than 12 (patient’s home) in Box 24B, then you must 
 complete Box 32.  In other words, if you provi de your services somewhere other than the patient’s 
 home, and do not complete Box 32, YOU WILL NOT BE PAID . 
 
 
• DO complete Boxes 17 and 17a when billing for diagnostic x-ray or laboratory  services 
 
 If you bill diagnostic radiology or laboratory servic es, and do not put your name and UPIN in Boxes 17 and 
 17a, YOU WILL NOT BE PAID .   
 
• DO NOT use Modifier 51 on extraspinal manipulation (98943) 
 
 If you bill extraspinal manipulation (98943) with a 51 modifier, YOU WILL NOT BE PAID . 
  
• DO use modifier 59 on 97140, 97124, and 97112 when combined with CMT and provided to 
separate body regions 
 
 If you bill manual therapy techniques (97140), massage (97124), or neuromuscular reeducation (97112) on 
 the same date of service as CMT (98940-98943), and do not append the 59 modifier, YOU WILL NOT BE 
 PAID .  (However, PLEASE NOTE , to bill them separately; they must be applied to separate body regions.  
 Then, to indicate this, you must append the 59 modifier and use appropriate diagnosis pointers in Box  24E.) 
 
 
• DO NOT use quotes (“), hyphens (-), number signs (#), or dots (.) on claims 
 
 If you use quotes, hyphens, dots, etc.  inappropriately on the claim form,  YOU WILL NOT BE PAID . 
 
 
• DO NOT expect Medicare reimbursement for hot/cold packs  
 
 97010 (hot/cold packs) is a non-covered service under M edicare—it is considered a “bundled” service.  If 
 you bill hot/cold packs to Medicare, YOU WILL NOT BE PAID .   
  
• DO make sure that you use approved ICD-9 codes 
 
 If you use ICD-9 codes on your demo claim form  that are NOT on the approved list (Table 6), YOU 
 WILL NOT BE PAID .   
  
• DO NOT use more than one diagnosis pointer in Box 24E 
 
 If you use more than one diagnosis pointer in Box 24E, YOU WILL NOT BE PAID .  
 
 
• DO use the 25 modifier when billing E/M services the same day as CMT 
  If you bill E/M services on the same day as CM T, and do not use the 25 modifier on the E/M code, 
 YOU WILL NOT BE PAID .   
  
• DO be familiar with all pertinent Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) 
 
 You should be familiar with your carrier’s local policie s on CMT, therapy, x-ray, and/or lab services.  This is 
 especially important for therapy services, as they may specify diagnoses to be used for each procedure.  
 These LCDs can be found on your carrier’s website.  If you do not follow the instructions and guidelines 
 outlined in the LCDs, YOU WILL NOT BE PAID .

Documenting Medical Necessity for Medicare  
Integrating PART to Ensure Compliance  
 
Under the policies developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), coverage of 
chiropractic services is specifically limited to manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation .  
Unless this subluxation is properly documented, medical necessity has not been established and claims may 
be rejected by Medicare.   
 
In this piece , we will review the documentation guidelines CMS has established.  We will help identify what  
the carriers are looking for, when  they want it, and where  the documentation must appear.   
 
Utilization guidelines for chiropractic services require the followi ng three components  in order to establish 
medical necessity:  
 
1 Presence of a subluxation that causes a significant neuromusculoskeletal 
condition.  
Medicare will not pay for treatment unless it is by manual manipulation of the spine to correct a 
subluxation.   The subluxation must be consistent with the complaint/condition.  
 
2 Documentation of the Subluxation  
A subluxation may be demonstrated by one of two methods:  x-ray or physical examination .  If 
documented by physical examination, the PART system (as descri bed below) must be used.  
 
3 Documentation of the Initial and Subsequent Visits  
Specific documentation requirements apply whether the subluxation is demonstrated by x -ray or by 
physical examination.  
 
PRESENCE OF A SUBLUXATION  
 
The subluxation is defined as a motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity, and/or physiological 
function of the spine are altered although contact between joint surfaces remains intact.  Medicare will not pay 
for treatment unless it  is “manual manipulation of the spine to co rrect a subluxation.”  Therefore, you 
must document in your patient’s physical examination, their initial chart notes, and subsequent chart notes 
that you are indeed treating a subluxation .  Most Medicare carriers require that the primary diagnosis 
reporte d on the CMS -1500 form is subluxation .  Some carriers require the use of 839 level ICD -9 diagnosis 
codes and others require the use of 739 series ICD -9 diagnosis codes to describe the subluxation.  Check 
your carrier’s Local Medicare Review Policy (LMRP) t o be sure which diagnosis is required.   
 
DOCUMENTATION OF THE SUBLUXATION:  The PART System  
 
One of the hottest topics for chiropractors over recent months has been the PART documentation system for 
Medicare.  Recall that the subluxation may be documented  by one of two methods: x -ray or physical 
examination, and that if the latter is used it must be documented according to the PART system.  The four 
components of PART are described below.  HCFA requires that at least two of the four components must be 
docu mented, and at least one of A or R. 
 4 
 
 
 
  
 PAIN AND TENDERNESS  
 Identify using one or more of the following:  
§ Observation : You can document, by personal observation, the pain that the patient exhibits during 
the course of the examination.  Note the loca tion, quality, and severity of the pain  
§ Percussion, Palpation, or Provocation : When examining the patient, ask them if pain is 
reproduced, such as, “Let me know if any of this causes discomfort.”  
§ Visual Analog Type Scale:  The patient is asked to grade the pain on a visual analog type scale 
from 0 -10. 
§ Audio Confirmation:  Like the visual analog scale, the patient is asked to verbally grade their pain 
from 0 -10. 
§ Pain questionnaires:  Patient questionnaires, such as the McGill pain questionnaire or an in -office 
patient history form, can be used for the patient to describe their pain.  
 
 ASYMMETRY/MISALIGNMENT  
 Identify on a sectional or segmental level by using one or more of the following:    
§ Observation : You can observe patient posture or analyze gait.  
§ Static and Dynamic Palpation : Describe the spinal misaligned vertebrae and symmetry.  
§ Diagnostic Imaging : You can use x -ray, CAT scan and MRI to identify misalignments.  
 
 RANGE OF MOTION ABNORMALITY  
 Identify an increase or decrease in segmental mobility using o ne or more of the following:   
§ Observation : You can observe an increase or decrease in the patient’s range of motion.  
§ Motion Palpation : You can record your palpation findings, including listing(s).  Be sure to record 
the various areas that are involved and  related to the regions manipulated.  
§ Stress Diagnostic Imaging : You can x -ray the patient using bending views.  
§ Range of Motion Measuring Devices : Devices such as goniometers or inclinometers can be used 
to record specific measurements.  
 
 TISSUE, TONE CH ANGES  
 Identify using one or more of the following  
§ Observation : Visible changes such as signs of spasm, inflammation, swelling, rigidity, etc.  
§ Palpation : Palpated changes in the tissue, such as hypertonicity, hypotonicity, spasm, 
inflammation, tautness, ri gidity, flaccidity, etc. can be found on palpation.  
§ Use of instrumentation : Document the instrument used and findings.  
§ Tests for Length and Strength : Document leg length, scoliosis contracture, and strength of 
muscles that relate.   
 
The above descriptions  must be included in your patient’s record.  No specific national policy exists on when 
you should send your records to your carrier.  Individual carriers may specify what they want, and when, but 
as a matter of rule only the CMS -1500 form is submitted.  B ecause of this, it is vital that all appropriate boxes 
on the CMS -1500 are filled in completely and accurately for each billing submitted since the CMS –1500 
claims form is considered a necessary part of the documentation requirements.  The carrier may requ est 
patient records at times, so it is just as important to keep standardized patient chart notes.

DOCUMENTATION OF THE  INITIAL AND SUBSEQU ENT VISITS  
 
As you already know, CMS has established specific requirements for documentation of both initial and 
subsequent office visits.  Before we integrate PART, let’s review these requirements:  
 
Initial Visit Requirements  
§ Relevant History of Patient’s Condition with Detailed Description of the Present Condition  
§ Evaluation of Musculoskeletal/Nervous System Throu gh Physical Examination  
§ Diagnosis  
§ Treatment Plan  
§ Recommended level of care (duration and frequency of visits)  
§ Specific treatment goals  
§ Objective measures to evaluate treatment effectiveness  
§ Date of Initial Treatment  
 
Subsequent Visit Requirements  
§ History  
§ Review of chief complaint  
§ Improvement or regression since last visit  
§ System review, if relevant.  
§ Physical Examination  CMS states that the following requirements  should be included in y our patient chart notes to describe 
the presenting complaint.  After completing your case history with the patient, you should be able to ask 
yourself the questions below and answer them with your documentation:  
 
Requirement  Ask Yourself  
Symptoms causing the patient to seek 
treatment  Why is patient seeking care?  
Mechanism of onset   How did the condition/injury happen?  
Gradual/sudden?  
Quality and character of symptoms/problem  
Onset, duration, intensity, frequency, 
location, and radiation of symptoms  Do my notes paint a picture of the patient’s symptoms, 
including specific descr iptive remarks that would allow 
a third -party reader to fully understand this complaint?  
Aggravating or relieving factors  What causes the condition to improve or worsen?  
Prior i nterventions, treatments, medications, 
secondary complaint  What has been tried in the past and are there any 
complicating factors?  
Family history, if relevant  Are there any factors in the family history that relate to 
this condition?  
Past health history (general health, prior 
illness, injuries, hospitalizations, medication, 
surgical history)  What aspects of the patient’s health history factor into 
this current condition?  
 
NOTE:  These symptoms must bear a direct relationship to the level of subluxation. The symptoms 
should refer to the spine, muscle, bone, rib, and joint and be reported as pain, inflammation, or as signs 
such as swelling, spasticity, etc. Vertebral pinching of spinal nerves may cause headaches, arm, 
shoulder and hand problems as well as l eg and foot pains and numbness. Rib and rib/chest pains are 
also recognized symptoms, but in general other symptoms must relate to the spine as such.  
 6§ Exam of the spine involved in diagnosis  
§ Assessment of change in patient condition since last visit  
§ Evaluation of treatment effectiveness  
§ Documentation of Treatment Given on Day of Visit  
§ Any Changes to the Treatment Plan  
 
IN CONCLUSION…  
 
As you can see, Medicare’s documentation requirements are very specific, and it is possible to meet the 
requirement for documenting a subluxation within your daily chart notes.  You must use the common sense 
approach to documentation.  What may be appropriate documentation for one visit may not be adequate in 
another when other factors are taken into consideration such as frequency, duration of condition, sever ity of 
condition, past history, other documentation, etc.  
 
Our Medicare sources have indicated that in a records -review process, these are some 
of the questions they will be asking about your records, giving consideration to the 
combined documentation of t he initial and subsequent visit(s):  
  
• Does the record show a significant neuromusculoskeletal condition?  
• Is there a precise subluxation(s) documented by physical exam or x -ray? 
• Does the exam substantiate the condition and the subluxation?  
• Is the complaint consistent with the subluxation level(s)?  
• Is there a primary diagnosis of subluxation and a secondary ICD diagnosis that bears a direct 
relationship to the primary level of subluxation?  
• Is there a treatment plan?  
• Is the adjustment clearly recorded in the r ecord as being done each visit with the specific vertebral 
segment(s) identified?  
• In order to substantiate the need and frequency of ongoing care, does your documentation note a 
response to treatment, i.e., increased range of motion, increased function, de creased pain, etc?  
• Do the subjective complaints and objective findings reflect qualitative and quantitative factors when 
describing onset, duration, intensity, frequency, and location?  
• Is the adjustment therapeutic or maintenance (maintenance is non -covere d by Medicare)?

evaluator are reviewed and compared to others, however, often a common "trend" or "theme" can be found permeating each of the reports
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
• Trends such as this may lead those using 
or reviewing the evaluator to question their credibility (or bias)
• The following are examples of some of 
the "SMOKE AND MIRRORS" reports that we have reviewed since the release of the 5th edition
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
EXAMPLE #l: THE "THRESHOLD“
• The "Threshold" report is a specialized 
report that is most often requested by and prepared for the plaintiff's attorney
• The main objective of any good 
"Threshold" report is to certify that the examinee has been found to meet a certain "threshold" of impairment
– let’s say an additional 2% 
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
THE "THRESHOLD“ – cont’d
• This may be needed for any number of 
reasons - to
– increase the monetary amount of an award in an 
insurance or Workers' Compensation claim
– reopen a claim for additional disability benefits 
and/or treatment
– reach a specified percent whole person impairment 
which qualifies the examinee for a higher category of illness
• Permanent Total Disability vs. Permanent Partial 
Disability. 
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
THE "THRESHOLD“ – cont’d
• Meeting the goals and objectives of the 
particular threshold is not always easy if one performs an accurate examination and also faithfully adheres to the AMA Guides criteria
• It is usually necessary to take a few liberties 
with both the letter and the spirit of the AMA Guides to accomplish one's objective in a "Threshold" report, since the examinee usually has already had one or more evaluations by one or more evaluators
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
THE "THRESHOLD“ – cont’d
• Often, those reports have already 
recommended the maximum impairment percent to which the individual is legitimately entitled
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
THE "THRESHOLD“ – cont’d
• A "Threshold" report is usually fairly 
easy to identify
• These reports are notoriously vague• There are often no hard figures from 
which to compare the claimant's status to his former status or to the status reported in an earlier impairment rating evaluation evaluation 
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
THE "THRESHOLD“ – cont’d
• "Threshold" reports are often lacking in a 
detailed history, review of medical records or reports of imaging studies
• Work sheets and raw data are almost 
never included in the report
• Often, when measurements are included 
in the report they are similar to those found in the "Dry Lab" report 
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
THE "THRESHOLD“ – cont’d
• Rarely does the report contain clear, 
unambiguous statements like 
– "three consecutive measurements were recorded in 
accordance with the General Measurement Principles found in the AMA Guides" or 
– "the motions were not curtailed due to a report of 
pain, fear of injury, or neuromuscular inhibition" or 
– "the individual was examined in accordance with the 
technique found on page "xx" of the AMA Guides" 
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
THE "THRESHOLD“ – cont’d
• More often, the report contains statements such 
as
– "In my opinion, Mr. Tones is entitled to 35% whole 
person impairment" and 
– "In preparing this report, I used or followed the 
AMA Guides" or 
– "according to the AMA Guides, Mr. Jones is entitled 
to 55% whole person impairment“
• without ever citing a Figure, Table or page 
number where the statement can be verified 
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #2: The "Dry Lab" Report
• Not infrequently, a random sample of a 
particular rater's reports will be targeted for review based on a letter of complaint from one or more examinees
• These letters often report discrepancies in 
the report and the examination received 
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #2: The "Dry Lab" – cont’d
• One section of the AMA Guides (Fifth Edition) 
where raters may be tempted to report data that was not actually measured (otherwise known as "dry labbing" the results) is on the spinal range of motion worksheets
– Figure 15-18 Page 422 Cervical Range of Motion 
(ROM)
– Figure 15-14 Page 416 Thoracic Range of Motion 
(ROM)
– Figure 15-10 Page 410 Lumbar Range of Motion 
(ROM)
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #2: The "Dry Lab" – cont’d
• One of the requirements in the AMA Guides 
5th edition for using the Range of Motion Method in examination of the spine is that "...the examiner should obtain at least three consecutive measurements and calculate the mean (average) of the three" (p. 399) 
• A set of identical measurements in one or two 
planes of motion of a region of the spine is not uncommon
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #2: The "Dry Lab" – cont’d
• When a report contains three consecutive 
identical ROM measurements in every plane of motion in every region of the spine tested, a red flag is often raised in the reviewer’s mind
• Either the examinee was not putting forth a full 
effort, or the rater was taking one set of measurements and "cloning" the values to make it appear that three or more sets of measurements were taken
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #2: The "Dry Lab" – cont’d
• If six impairment rating reports are 
reviewed from the same rater wherein the spinal ROM Method was used, and if only one measurement was actually taken, trends may become apparent
• Such trends lead one to question the 
credibility of that report and other reports by the same rater 
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #3: The "Cookie Cutter“
• The "Cookie Cutter" reports are defined as 
being virtually identical in the examiner's findings depending on the part of the body injured
• Except for demographic information, there is 
very little variability among reports
– For instance, if the rating was for 
psychiatric/psychological impairment, every person examined "feels hopeless, helpless and worthless"  
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #3: The "Cookie Cutter“ – cont’d
• Everyone's symptoms started on the day of the 
injury or within one week of the injury
• Most have "contemplated suicide", but none 
have formulated a plan
• Also, no matter what the individual's past 
psychiatric/psychological history, or no matter what other "non-injury" related stressors are revealed in the history, the rater relates all or most of the person's symptoms to the injury
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #3: The "Cookie Cutter“ – cont’d
• If the impairment rating was for 
musculoskeletal impairment, every injured person has a marked impairment of that body part compared to the contralateral part
• Often, much of the report, including the 
examination findings of the unaffected body part, seem “boiler plate" - from word processor template
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #3: The "Cookie Cutter“ – cont’d
• We saw one specific example of this when an examiner 
placed "slightly abnormal" findings in the template of his reports
• A review of six (6) of his reports chosen at random 
revealed that 100% of the individuals he examined had 
– "mild peripheral cyanosis and skin coldness noted”
– "-peripheral pulses within low normal limits“– "Rombergs and Tandem walk were equivocal.“
• Every examinee showed "Vibration: normal to timing 
fork #256, no liberalization on forehead, elbows, wrists, knees, ankles and first toe"
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #3: The "Cookie Cutter“ – cont’d
• Not surprisingly, "Cookie Cutter" reports, 
like the "Threshold" reports are often lacking in history, review of medical records and imaging reports, work sheets and raw data
• Active measurements are rarely 
mentioned
– perhaps because they were not done
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #3: The "Cookie Cutter“– cont’d
• Again, individually, these reports 
may seem credible, but if patterns are noticed by reviewers, this strains the credibility of the rater and his reports
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #4: The "Kitchen Sink" or 
"Pile On" Report
• In the "Kitchen Sink" or "Pile On" report, 
the evaluator makes a concerted effort to include absolutely anything and everything that could be remotely related to the primary injury/illness (and in more extreme cases, things that could not be) in determining the final whole person impairment
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #4: The "Kitchen Sink" – cont’d
• These reports are particularly insidious because they are 
usually written by raters with  extremely high degrees of 
understanding of the AMA Guides
• The calculations, therefore, are virtually flawless• The reasoning and extrapolations used in the reports is 
quite logical and will usually withstand the "reasonable man" standard
• The report is quite extensiv e and detailed with respect 
to the history and physical examination and extremely well documented
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #4: The "Kitchen Sink" – cont’d
• The thoroughness, the length of the report and 
the attention to detail are actually part of the smoke and mirrors found in the "Kitchen Sink" report
• A reviewer's initial impression may be one of 
"he/she can't possibly have that much impairment" 
• The "Kitchen Sink" report is usually the most 
credible of all of the "SMOKE AND MIRRORS“ reports
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #4: The "Kitchen Sink" – cont’d
• While the reviewer is distracted by looking for 
technical errors, which may account for the high impairment percentage, he/she overlooks some of the more subtle elements in the report
• In these reports, the Devil is not in the details, 
but in the overall approach of including every ratable body part/system in the impairment percentage 
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #4: The "Kitchen Sink" – cont’d
• There are several tricks that may be used 
by the "Kitchen Sink" or "Pile On" rater
• Quite often the examinee is found to have 
a total sacral (hip) motion (flexion plus extension) exceeding 55 degrees if the examinee is a male or 65 degrees if the examinee is female
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #4: The "Kitchen Sink" – cont’d
• This not only avoids the necessity of having to 
use the validity test in authenticating lumbar flexion and extension measurements, but also minimizes the true lumbar flexion/extension measurement
• All of this can be easily accomplished with a 
little twist of the wrist while holding the inclinometer placed on the sacrum
• An assistant can even be  present to record the 
findings
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #4: The "Kitchen Sink" – cont’d
•Another trick is to include in the physical 
examination everything that the examinee complains about or believes is related to the primary injury/illness even if it is not likely related
•An example of this would be finding a 
statement from the examinee in the History of Injury like 
–"when I fell, I also injured my (name your body 
part)"
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #4: The "Kitchen Sink" – cont’d
•The examiner then includes an evaluation of 
that extra body part (usually with ROM measurements) in the physical examination and in the impairment calculations
•When one carefully looks at all of 
documentation in the medical records, one is likely to find that the extra body part was never accepted as a compensable condition in the claim
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #4: The "Kitchen Sink" – cont’d
• Further, there are often no treating 
physician's records where the examinee ever mentioned this condition previously
• Yet another piece of "soft" evidence 
would be a statement by the examinee during the evaluation that 
– "when I wore the cervical collar for my neck 
injury, my back stiffened up"
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #4: The "Kitchen Sink" – cont’d
• When one includes internal organ 
dysfunction
– undocumented erectile dysfunction in a back 
injury examinee) and/or
– psychological sequellae from an injury or 
illness to the paradigm suggested
• then it is easy to understand that "the sky 
is the limit" in a "Pile On" impairment rating report
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #5: The "Missing Worksheet/Missing 
Raw Data” Report
• A copy of the examiners worksheets or other 
forms of raw data (tables, graphs, etc) are extremely important parts of any comprehensive impairment rating report
• It lends credibility to reports by documenting 
that the work was done according to proper protocol, and it allows others to verify the results of the evaluation
• Often, however, impairment rating reports are 
submitted without this important information
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #5: The "Missing 
Worksheet/Raw Data” Report – cont’d
• There are a variety of reasons why an 
examiner may not include worksheets photocopied from the AMA Guides or other raw data
– pulmonary function test (PFT) recordings
– nerve conduction studies (NCS) data– electromyogram (EMG) tracings 
Smoke and Mirrors – cont’d
Example #5: The "Missing 
Worksheet/Raw Data” Report – cont’d
• Whatever the reason may be for not 
including worksheets and other raw data as part of the final impairment rating report, one thing is true
• Failure to include this important material 
will lessen the credibility of the impairment rating report

•Normal bowel allows absorption  of 2% of 
ingested intact food protein
•First line of defense‐
•Mucosal barrier & secretory  IgA‐gut 
surveillance
•Normally gut immunocytes  produce and 
secrete IgA
•IgA “blocking  antibody” ‐lines the intestinal  
tract

•Kupffer cells‐macrophages  in the liver
11
Normal Flora
•“Mixture of organisms  found at an 
anatomical  site”
•Humans ‐consists of a few eucaryotic  fungi 
and protists ‐bacteria are most numerous  ‐
more than 200 to 400 species
•Mix of flora influenced  by genetics, age, sex, 
stress, nutrition,  diet, culture, and antibiotic  
use
12
12/8/2011
5•Dysbiotic ‐bad flora
•Symbiotic  ‐good flora
•Good flora ‐can compete with pathogenic  
species and displace them ‐produces anti‐
microbal substances  which inhibit the growth 
of pathogenic  bacteria
•You can re‐establish good flora after a few  
weeks
13
14
•Fetus is sterile in utero
•Colonization  of humans first occurs at birth 
with passage through the birth canal after the 
water breaks
•Handling and feeding of the infant after birth 
leads to establishment  of a stable normal flora 
on the skin, oral cavity and intestinal  tract in 
about 48 hours
15
12/8/2011
6•Three developmental  changes in humans 
that can affect the normal flora include ‐
•Weaning ‐flora in the intestinal tract
•The eruption of teeth –i n the oral cavity
•The onset and cessation  of ovarian 
functions  –i n the vagina
16
Unfriendly  Bacteria
•Most prevalent  bacteria –
•Bacteroides Gram‐negative, anaerobic,  
non‐spore forming bacteria
•They increase risk of colitis and colon 
cancer 
•Many of the normal flora are pathogens  or 
opportunistic  pathogens
17
Friendly Bacteria
•Bifidobacteria  ‐Gram‐positive, non‐spore 
forming, lactic acid bacteria
•Bifidobacterium  bifidum is the predominant  
bacterial species in the intestine of breast‐fed 
infants
•Appears to prevent colonization  by potential 
pathogens
•Used in yogurt and in probiotics
18
12/8/2011
7Where are they found?
•The greatest number of human adult 
bacteria are found in the lower intestinal 
tract (colon)
•Skin ‐1012bacteria
•Mouth ‐1010
•Gastrointestinal  tract ‐1014
19
•In the upper GI tract – esophagus
•Contains only bacteria swallowed  with saliva 
and food
•Stomach ‐Very few bacteria (mainly acid‐
tolerant lactobacilli)  
•At least 50% of US population  has the 
pathogenic  bacterium,  Helicobacter  pylori
20
•Proximal small intestine ‐sparse Gram‐
positive flora –m a i n l y lactobacilli  and 
Enterococcus  faecalis
•Distal small intestine ‐greater numbers of 
bacteria and additional  species ‐coliforms  (E. 
coli) and Bacteroides, in addition to 
lactobacilli  and enterococci
21
12/8/2011
8•Large intestine (colon) –
•Predominant  species are anaerobic  Bacteroides
and anaerobic  lactic acid bacteria in the genus 
Bifidobacterium (Bifidobacterium  bifidum )
•These organisms  may outnumber  E. coliby 
1,000:1 to 10,000:1 
•Coliforms  become more prominent
•Enterococci,  clostridia and lactobacilli  are found
22
MUTUAL BENEFIT ?
•Not much known about the associations  
between humans and their normal flora
•Dynamic interactions  rather than associations
•Both host and bacteria are thought to derive 
benefit from each other
•Most normal flora benefit their host ‐some of 
the normal flora are parasitic and some are 
pathogenic
23
•Normal flora gets –
•A steady supply of nutrients
•A stable environment
•Protection  and transport
•Host gets –
•Nutritional  and digestive benefits
•Stimulation  of the development  and activity of 
immune system
•Protection  against colonization  and infection by 
pathogenic  microbes
24
12/8/2011
9Benefits of Normal flora
•Synthesize  and excrete vitamins in excess of their 
own needs ‐which can be absorbed  as nutrients 
by their host
•In humans ‐enteric bacteria secrete
•Vitamin K
•Vitamin B12
•Lactic acid bacteria produce certain B‐vitamins
•Germ‐free animals may be deficient in Vitamin K 
to the extent that it is necessary  to supplement  
their diets
25
•Prevent colonization  by pathogens  by competing  
for attachment  sites or for essential nutrients
•Studies ‐germ‐free animals can be infected by 10 
Salmonella bacteria, while the infectious  dose for 
conventional  animals is near 106cells
•Inhibit or kill non‐indigenous  bacteria by  
producing  substances  such as ‐nonspecific  fatty 
acids and peroxides  to highly specific 
bacteriocins,  which inhibit or kill bacteria
26
•Stimulate  the development  of certain lymphatic  
tissues in the GI tract (such as the caecum and 
Peyer's patches ‐lymphoid  follicles in the 
intestine)
•The caecum (intestinal  cavity) of germ‐free 
animals is enlarged,  thin‐walled, and fluid‐filled, 
compared  to that organ in conventional  animals
•Intestinal  lymphatic  tissues of germ‐free animals 
are poorly developed  based on the ability to 
undergo immunological  stimulation  compared  to 
conventional  animals
27
12/8/2011
10•Stimulate   production  of natural antibodies
•Normal flora behave as antigens ‐they induce an 
immunological  response ‐an antibody‐mediated  
immune (AMI) response
•Low levels of antibodies  produced  against the 
normal flora cross react with related pathogens  –
and thus prevent infection or invasion
•Antibodies  produced  against antigenic 
components  of normal flora are called "natural" 
antibodies  –w h i c h are lacking in germ‐free 
animals
28
Harmful effects of normal flora
•Bacterial synergism  – between  normal flora and a 
potential pathogen  ‐One organism helps another 
to grow or survive
•Example ‐normal flora supplies a vitamin that a 
pathogen  needs to grow ‐called cross feeding 
between microbes
•Produce metabolites  that are carcinogenic ‐Some 
colon Bacteroides  produce carcinogenic  
metabolites  that may increase colon cancer risk
29
•Competition  for nutrients ‐bacteria in the GI tract 
must absorb some of the host's nutrients for their 
own needs
•Germ‐free animals are known to grow more 
rapidly and efficiently  than conventional  animals
•This is why antibiotics  are used in the food of 
swine, cows and poultry ‐the animal grows faster 
and can be marketed  earlier
•Unfortunately,  this leads to bacterial antibiotic  
resistance  in animals and humans
30
12/8/2011
11•Low grade toxemia ‐low amounts of bacterial 
toxins may enter circulation  – good or bad as 
these small amounts act as a bacterial antigen 
and stimulate  formation  of natural antibodies
•May cause endogenous  disease ‐Normal flora 
may cause disease if they reach a site or tissue 
where they cannot be restricted  or tolerated 
by host defenses ‐many of the normal flora 
are potential pathogens
31
•Transfer to susceptible  hosts ‐Some 
pathogens  that are part of the normal flora 
may rely on their host for transfer to other 
individuals  where they can produce disease 
•Examples  ‐upper respiratory  tract 
(Haemophilus  influenzae  and Staphylococcus  
aureus) –i n the gastrointestinal  tract (E. coli, 
Salmonella  or Clostridium)
32
Causes of decreased  intestinal flora
•Prolonged  use of antibiotics
•Prolonged  use of steroids and corticosteroids
•Prolonged  use of hormones  ‐BCPs
•Chemotherapy
•Stress
•Sulfa drugs
•Antacids
•Old age
33
12/8/2011
12Candidiasis
(dysbiotic/leaky  gut)
•Leaky Gut –F r o m possible increased  intestinal  
permeability
•Candidiasis  ‐Overgrowth of  candida albicans 
in mucous membranes  or hypersensitivity to  
the organism
•Fatigue
•Bloating, gas, pain, diarrhea
•Decreased  libido
•Increased  or chronic UTI and vaginal infections
34
35
Predisposing  Factors
•Previous causes of decreased  intestinal flora
•Decreased  digestive enzymes
•Drugs
•Nutrient deficiencies ‐almost all are needed for 
optimal immune functioning
•Chronic diseases‐immune suppression
•High sugar, high yeast foods  ‐(cheese, alcohol), milk
•Decreased  liver function‐toxins of candida are filtered 
by the liver
36
12/8/2011
13Treatment  strategy
To eliminate or  reduce the 
predisposing  factors and  causes of 
candida overgrowth  and the 
destruction  of normal good microflora  
in the intestines
37
4 step strategy
•Kill bad flora/yeast
•Heal the intestine
•Replace with  good flora
•Prevent recurrences
•Prior to the 4 step strategy you need to 
eliminate  the predisposing  factors that  may 
have caused the overgrowth
38
KILL IT
•Citriseed extract 
•Grape seed
•Pumpkin seed
•Garlic
•All will require approximately  3‐6 capsules/day
39
12/8/2011
14HEAL IT and REPLACE IT
•Glutamine 1 ‐2 capsules/day  usually 500mg 
per capsule

1Food Allergy – Food Intolerance
•True food allergy ‐
•Immune system involved ‐Ige antibody 
activity and chemical mediators  released
•Food intolerance ‐no Ige response ‐
immune system is not responsible  for the 
symptoms  –e x p . milk allergy is different 
from not being able to digest it due to 
lactose intolerance
1
Statistics
•1 in 3 people either say that they have a food 
allergy or that they modify their diet due to 
discomfort
•True Food allergies ‐5% of children and 4% 
teens and adults in the U.S.
•Evidence of familial tendency
•Food Intolerance  ‐60% in U.S. have food 
reaction symptoms
2
Food Allergens
•Proteins within the food that are not broken 
down by the heat of cooking or by stomach 
acids or enzymes
•The proteins stay completely  or partially intact
•Cross the gastrointestinal  lining and enter the 
bloodstream
•Go to target organs ‐causing allergic reactions 
throughout  the body
3
12/8/2011
2Common Allergy Foods
•Adults
•Peanuts ‐tree nuts such as walnuts ‐shellfish ‐
milk ‐eggs
•Children
•Eggs – milk – peanuts
•Can sometimes  outgrow them (more likely to 
outgrow milk, eggs, or soy allergies compared  
to peanuts, fish, or shrimp)
4
Food Intolerance  due to ‐
•Contamination of  foods with microorganisms  
(bacteria,  and their products,  such as toxins)

5
Tests
•Skin tests
•Blood tests (RAST and ELISA)
•Double‐blind food challenge  ‐gold standard of 
allergy testing – foods are put in individual  
capsules –p a t i e n t takes a capsule and then see if 
a reaction occurs (Dr also blinded) ‐expensive  ‐
multiple food allergies are difficult to evaluate –
done infrequently
•Oral Food Challenge  ‐5 day pure water fast
•Oral Food Challenge  ‐Elimination  diet

10
11
Constipation
•Affects 2% of the US population
•Women and elderly more affected
•Going longer than three days without a bowel 
movement  is too long ‐After three days, the 
stool or feces become harder and more 
difficult to pass
•Need at least 3 bowel movements  per week to 
prevent toxins from accumulating

7Diarrhea
•Loose and watery stools
•Very common ‐Usually not serious
•Typically lasts two to three days

•Medications  ‐Diseases of the intestines  (IBD)‐
Malabsorption  ‐Hyperthyroidism  ‐Some cancers 
‐Laxative abuse ‐Alcohol abuse
19
Classifications
•Osmotic diarrhea ‐something  in the bowel is 
drawing water from the body into the bowel –
(exp ‐sugar substitute  –s o r b i t o l  ‐not absorbed  ‐
but draws water from the body into the bowel)
•Secretory  diarrhea ‐body releases water into the 
bowel when it's not supposed  to –i n f e c t i o n s  and 
drugs can do this
•Exudative  diarrhea ‐presence of blood and pus in 
the stool ‐inflammatory  bowel diseases and 
several infections
20
Diarrhea Therapy

after eating or during the night
•Medical Therapy – Antacids  and Antibiotics  to 
eradicate  H. Pylori
•Diet therapy ‐should be aimed at increasing  
integrity of stomach lining and not at the acid
23
Causes
•Excessive  stomach acid secretion
•Helicobacter  pylori bacterial infection ‐primary 
cause of peptic ulcers ‐present in > 90% of 
duodenal  ulcers and 80% of stomach ulcers
•Excessive  OTC painkillers  (aspirin, ibuprofen,  
naproxen  and NSAIDS)
•High temperature  foods
•Heavy alcohol use
•Smoking exacerbates  and may promote ulcers
24
12/8/2011
9•Probably not stress‐patients with low stress 
levels have just as many ulcers as those with 
high stress levels
•Probably not fast food
•Elderly people have more stomach ulcers
•People with Type A blood are more likely to 
develop cancerous  stomach ulcers
•Duodenal  ulcers tend to appear in people with 
type O blood
25
26
Diet therapy
•High fiber diets‐promote mucin secretion
•Avoid sugar‐may increase gastric acidity
•Avoid milk‐has transient neutralizing  effect on 
acidity followed by a rise in acid secretion
•Eat early dinners and avoid late night snacks ‐
reduces acidity compared  to late dinners
•Avoid caffeine‐may exacerbate  not cause
existing ulcers and increase symptoms
27
12/8/2011
10Natural Antacids

•More often in people who have type I Diabetes and 
Down syndrome
33
12/8/2011
12Etiology
•Villi in small intestine normally create a large 
surface to absorb vitamins, sugars, etc
•With the disease ‐the villi flatten out and the 
intestinal lining becomes inflamed
•Result ‐decreased  area to absorb nutrients
•Can lead to malabsorption – and  result in IDA, 
rickets, folic acid deficiency,  osteoporosis,  etc
•After the villi return to normal ‐months to years ‐
body can absorb nutrients properly ‐maintaining  
a gluten‐free diet even without symptoms  is very 
important
34
Symptoms
•Many have mild or no symptoms
•Symptoms  may come and go
•Gas, abdominal  swelling, bloating, stomach pain
•Abnormal  stools (diarrhea)  – constipation  more 
in children
•Weight loss despite normal appetite 
•Fatigue and weakness
•Vomiting after eating gluten (Children)
35
Treatment
•Gluten free diet
•No wheat, rye, barley, oats, buckwheat?
•Oats may gradually be re‐introduced
•No milk products
•In 2 weeks ‐most people improve ‐Symptoms  
should completely  disappear  within 3 months
•Read Labels ‐"modified  food starch" or 
"hydrolyzed  vegetable  protein" may contain 
gluten
36
12/8/2011
13•Corn, rice, millet and grits are allowed
•Flours and starches made from rice, corn, 
buckwheat,  potatoes,  and soybeans  are also 
okay
•Avoid beer ‐both with and without alcohol ‐
including lagers, ales, and stouts
•Papain‐500‐1,000mg/meals  ‐digests wheat 
gluten
37
Risks of the Disease
•Adults ‐slightly higher‐than‐average risk of 
lymphoma ‐usually develops in the intestine ‐
following a gluten‐free diet lowers the risk
•Slight increased  risk of esophageal  cancer
•Osteoporosis
•Anemia –I D A and Folic Acid def
•Infertility/miscarriages
•Frequent respiratory  infections
•Problems  with memory and concentration
38
Children

cereal in the diet ‐usually after 6 months of age
•Early introduction  of cows milk and cereal (wheat  may 
be introduced  after 1 year)
•Even if no symptoms  after eating gluten ‐child must 
stay on lifelong gluten‐free diet to avoid intestinal  
damage
•Children may not reach their full height or weight 
•Delayed onset of puberty
•Irritability
39
12/8/2011
1Diverticulosis  
Diverticulitis
•Diverticulosis ‐small mucosal sacs that protrude 
through the intestinal wall
•Low fiber diet may lead to diverticulosis
•Without fiber (bulk) – colon works harder to push 
the stool ‐pressure from this may cause pouches to 
form in weak spots
•Diverticulitis ‐sacs become inflamed ‐when feces get 
trapped in the pouches ‐allows bacteria to grow and 
leads to inflammation  or infection
1
2
Symptoms
•Can last from a few hours to a week or more
•Stomach pain –m o s t common ‐usually lower 
left side –a t times worse with movements
•Fever and chills 
•Bloating and gas 
•Diarrhea or constipation  
•Nausea and sometimes  vomiting 
•Not feeling like eating
3
12/8/2011
2Treatment
•During pain or an attack ‐Clear liquid or bland 
diet that is low in fiber until  pain goes away
•After recovery from an attack – Gradually  
increase the amount of fiber in the diet through 
fruits, vegetables  –h a v e a high fiber diet
•High fluid intake
•Avoid seeds, nuts, berries, popcorn ‐certain 
grains ‐may get trapped in the sacs and make it 
worse ???
•Multivitamin  and mineral
•Acidophilus  ‐destroys putrefactive  bacteria
4
Inflammatory  Bowel Disease
•Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative  Colitis
•Unknown  etiology 
•No cure
•Together affect 500,000 to 2,000,000  in US
•Men and women equally affected
•Commonly  begins during adolescence  and 
early adulthood  ‐but can begin at any time
5
•Crohns ‐Regional enteritis‐inflammatory  disease 
affecting mostly terminal ileum (any part of tract)
•Named after a physician  in 1932 
•Ulcerative  Colitis‐more common than crohns
•Inflammation  and sores of the lining of the large 
intestine (colon  and rectum)
•Loss of fluid and electrolytes  ‐water and minerals 
are expelled instead of being absorbed
•People who have ulcerative  colitis for 8 years or 
longer have a greater chance of getting cancer
6
12/8/2011
3Overall Symptoms
•Usually intermittent  (although  5%‐10% of people 
have constant symptoms)  
•Stomach pain or cramps
•Constipation  or Diarrhea (some have 10‐20x/day)
•Loss of appetite and loss of weight
•Bleeding from the rectum
•Loss of Weight
•Some have fever
•Other problems  may occur ‐joint pain, eye 
problems,  or liver disease
7
Therapy 
•Compared  to controls –t h o s e who develop 
crohns‐eat more refined sugar, less fruit, less 
vegetables  and less fiber
•Multivitamin  and mineral
•Need adequate  caloric intake
•Eat frequent and small meals
•Eliminate  refined CHOs and sugar ‐allows 
intestinal spasms to occur –a g g r a v a t i n g  the 
condition
•Increase fruits ‐vegetables  ‐fiber
8
•Elimination  diet is the number one therapy of 
choice
•Avoid the following ‐Milk ‐wheat –d a i r y ‐soy –
nuts –r a w fruit tomatoes  ‐corn – shellfish  –
pickles ‐carbonated  drinks

•Slippery Elm
•Both help to soothe the gut lining
•Fish oil‐enteric coated
•1.8 grams of EPA and .9 grams DHA
9
12/8/2011
4Lactose Intolerance
•Common in adults and runs in families
•Due to lactase enzyme deficiency
•Small intestine does not make enough lactase –
breaks down lactose–lactose  sugar remains intact
•70‐75% of Mediterranean  countries,  African‐
Americans,  Native Americans  and 90% of 
Orientals
•Most children lose the lactase enzyme by 3‐7 
years of age
10
Symptoms
•Mild to severe
•Develop during teen or adult years
•Begin 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating/drinking
•Bloating
•Pain or cramps
•Gurgling or rumbling sounds
•Gas
•Loose stools/diarrhea
•Vomiting
11
Treatment
•There is no cure for lactose intolerance
•Modified elimination  diet  ‐Lactose free diet
•No milk or milk products ‐(lactaid and soy 
milk ‐ok)
•Most can eat some dairy or milk especially  
yogurt
•Take lactase supplements
12
12/8/2011
5Gastric Esophageal  Reflux (GERD)
•The lower esophageal  sphincter  (LES) is involved
•LES ‐Ring of muscle between the esophagus  and 
stomach 
•Normal digestion ‐LES opens to allow food into 
the stomach and closes to prevent food and 
stomach acids from flowing back into the 
esophagus
•Reflux occurs when the LES is weak or relaxes ‐
allows stomach contents to flow up into the 
esophagus
13
Incidence  and Symptoms
•More than 60 million American  adults have 
heartburn  at least once a month
•25 million adults suffer daily from 
heartburn
•Heartburn  and Indigestion  –m o s t common 
– burning  behind the sternum
•Being overweight  worsens symptoms
14
Triggers
•Top Three Triggers
•Fatty foods –s t a y in the stomach longer –
more acid produced  –l a z y LES
•Large portions –m o s t common ‐Stomach 
stretches or distends ‐pressure on the LES
•Late‐night meals
15
12/8/2011
6Avoid the Following
(Cause LES to relax)
•Fatty meals
•Milk
•Alcohol, particularly  red wine
•Spicy foods and black pepper, garlic, raw onions
•Chocolate  and Sugar
•Citrus fruits/products  ‐oranges and orange juice
•Coffee and caffeinated  drinks ‐Tea and soda
•Peppermint  and Spearmint
•Tomatoes
16
Lifestyle Changes
•Eat early dinner ‐Don't eat before bedtime ‐
Allow 2 hours to digest your food before lying 
down
•Small bland feedings ‐Eat five or six small meals 
each day ‐instead of several large meals
•Raise the head of the bed or chair
•Exercise – Crunches  and leg lifts can aggravate
•Jogging, aerobics and yoga may aggravate
•Avoid Smoking – relaxes the LES
17
Gas (Flatulence)
•Most common digestive problem
•Most people produce about 1‐3 pints a day 
and pass gas about 14 times a day
•Most foods that contain carbohydrates  
can cause gas
•Fats and proteins cause little gas
•These common foods and their natural 
components  may create gas
18
12/8/2011
7Etiology and Therapy
•Why? From three sources ‐
•Eating to fast or when upset‐(swallowed  air)

12•IBS is correlated  with –
•Family history –g r e a t e r risk if parent or sibling 
has the condition
•Abnormal  serotonin  levels ‐plays a role in 
normal digestive system function
•Reduced beneficial  intestinal  flora

Assessment Criteria
Minor Criteria
Minor Criteria
1. Did the report include a chronological
summary of the medical records reviewed?
– A good impairment rating (and IME) report 
should include a summary in chronological order of all the reports in the examinee's medical record
– Those reading the report can then judge for 
themselves if the IME provider was missing and/or ignored important information
Minor Criteria – cont’d
2. Did the report indicate that imaging had been 
reviewed and, if so, by whom?
– One example where this would be of importance is 
with evaluation of motion segment integrity
– Have reviewed impairment rating reports that state
"There is no evidence of loss of motion segment 
integrity" (hearsay?)
• The impairment rater failed to mention if that was his 
opinion or the opinion of the radiologist or if the examiner had personally reviewed and measured the changes on the x-ray or if the conclusion was based on negative information
– the radiologist made no mention "loss of motion segment 
integrity" in the report
Minor Criteria – cont’d
3. Did the IME address any major inconsistencies 
(between the records reviewed, history, physical 
exam, lab and other studies)?
– All too often, have reviewed reports wherein the 
impairment rater has accepted and reported information and allegations obtained from the examinee during the history of the injury/illness, but failed to point out in the impairment rating report that a review of the office notes from the treating physician (covering almost two years of medical treatment) failed to support the examinee's current allegations
– Identifying and addressing such inconsistencies lends 
credibility to the report
Minor Criteria – cont’d
4. Did the report include photocopies of all work 
sheets, summary sheets and raw data (such as EMG findings)?
– This information not only makes an 
impairment report more credible, but also makes it easier for the reviewer to assess the accuracy of the report
– Part of the instructions in the AMA Guides 
(Fifth Edition) state that the examiner may photocopy and use certain non-copyrighted pages for their report
• Fig 16-1a & b pgs 436-437
Minor Criteria – cont’d
5. Were reports/forms signed and dated (original 
signature) with evaluator's name, address and telephone number included? 
– This final set of criteria puts the finishing touch on a 
professional impairment rating report
– On occasion, we have reviewed reports that did not 
have original signatures (dictated but not read)
– This procedure may give the erroneous impression 
that the writer of the report is trying to avoid legal responsibility for the content
Common Errors 
Common Errors
Error # 1 - Reading Only A Footnote Or A 
Word And Not The Entire Text
– This is probably one the most common category of 
Errors that we have found
– Example: THE VALIDITY TEST FOR LUMBAR FLEXION/EXTENSION 
pg 405-406
• The sum of the sacral flexion (40 degrees) and the sacral 
extension (4 degrees) was 44 degrees
• The tightest straight-leg-raising (SLR) was 35 degrees• The evaluator considered the results of the lumbar range of 
motion (ROM) invalid due to the fact that the straight-leg-raising on the tightest side was not within 15 degrees of the total hip motion
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 1 – cont’d
THE VALIDITY TEST FOR LUMBAR FLEXION/EXTENSION pg 
405-406
THE ERROR
– The evaluator cited section(d) from Figure 
15-8, page 405
– The full text states that the lumbar 
flexion/extension values are invalid only if the tightest SLR exceeds the sum of the 
sacral flexion and extension by more than 15 degrees pg 406 number 6
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 1 – cont’d
THE VALIDITY TEST FOR LUMBAR FLEXION/EXTENSION pg 
405-406
Correct Answer
–The lumbar flexion and extension measurements 
were VALID and should have been included in 
the total whole person impairment calculations
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 1 – cont’d
THE VALIDITY TEST FOR LUMBAR FLEXION/EXTENSION pg 
405-406
Comment
– There are many examples that the presenter has 
found where an evaluator has read only a part of an explanation and has failed to follow the complete instructions found elsewhere in the "Guides"
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 1 – cont’d
Example: Range of Motion (ROM) 
Method -Table 15-7 Page 404
– Find reports where the Range of Motion method is 
used for the spine and the evaluator considered the impairment in only one region of the spine
– Some reports even state that considering more than 
one region of the spine using Table 15-7 is not allowed by the AMA Guides Fifth Edition
– This is inaccurate
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 1 – cont’d
Range of Motion (ROM) Method -Table 15-7 Page 404
The Error
–On page 402-403 is found a set of instructions. Item 
number three (3) states "If there are two or more diagnoses within a spinal region, use that which is most significant
–This percent will be combined with those for the impaired 
range(s) of motion and the whole person neurologic deficit (steps 7-9 below)”
–Some evaluators read only part of this section and 
incorrectly infer that only the primarily involved region can be included the ROM Method
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 1 – cont’d
Range of Motion (ROM) Method -Table 15-7 Page 404
The Correct Answer
–Instructions for using Table 15-7 can be found on page 403
–Item number two (2) states "Identify the most significant 
(impairing) diagnosis of the primarily involved region (lumbar, thoracic, or cervical)
–Item number three (3) states “The diagnosed-based 
impairment percent should be combined with the range-of-motion impairment estimates and whole person impairment estimates involving sensation, weakness, and other conditions of the musculoskeletal, nervous, or other organ systems” 
–Item five (5) states “Repeat for other involved spinal 
regions and combined regional impairments if those exist”
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 2 -Reading Only a Single Chapter 
While Not Understanding the General 
Principles in the Fifth Edition of the AMA Guides
Example: Two Cases of Severe Cardiac Impairment
–We have seen two (2) cases, both involving major trauma to 
the heart, wherein the respective evaluators - both respected cardiologists - failed to calculate the proper whole person impairment due to the fact that they only used Chapters 3 and 4, The Cardiovascular System and failed to consider general underlying principles that relate to all chapters of the AMA Guides
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 2 - cont’d
Reading Only a Single Chapter While Not Understanding 
the General Principles in the Fifth Edition of the AMA Guides
Example – cont’d
–The first case involved a mechanic who had been 
in the process of removing a large truck tire from a split rim when it exploded, knocking the mechanic across the room
–The second case was that of a law enforcement 
official who suffered a myocardial infarction while chasing a criminal and was without oxygen to the brain for more than four minutes.
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 2 - cont’d
Reading Only a Single Chapter While Not Understanding the General 
Principles in the Fifth Edition of the AMA Guides
Example – cont’d
–Both evaluators correctly rated their respective 
claimants as qualifying for Class 4; 50% - 100% impairment of the whole person using Table 3-5 page Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Valvular Heart Disease (page 30)
–Neither claimant's status was "near death" when 
rated
–Each examiner then recommended 100% Whole 
Person Impairment for the respective claimants
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 2 - cont’d
Reading Only a Single Chapter While Not Understanding the 
General Principles in the Fifth Edition of the AMA Guides
The Error
–Page 5, 1.2 Impairment, Disability, and 
Handicap, clearly states, “A 90% to 100% WP (whole person) impairment indicates a very severe organ or body system impairment requiring the individual to be fully dependent on others for self-care, approaching death”
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 2 - cont’d
Reading Only a Single Chapter While Not Understanding the 
General Principles in the Fifth Edition of the AMA Guides
The Correct Answer
–75% Whole Person Impairment
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 2 - cont’d
• Reading Only a Single Chapter While Not U nderstanding the General Principles in the 
Fifth Edition of the AMA Guides
Comment
–When each of the cardiologists were contacted by telephone 
and were made aware of the statement from page 5, 1.2 Impairment, Disability, and Ha ndicap, each submitted an 
addendum to their respective reports
•In the first case the claimant also had other injuries of 
an orthopedic nature
•In the second case the claimant also had impairment to 
the brain secondary to anoxia
–The amended reports allowed for the other impairments to 
be combined with the primary impairment to the cardiovascular system
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #3 - Combining Before Converting
Example:  A Case of Bilateral Wrist Injury
– This case was relatively simple
– The claimant had a legitimate ten percent (10%) 
impairment of both wrists
• This (10%) was an upper extremity impairment not whole 
person impairment
– The examiner used the Combined Values Chart, 
pages 604-606 to combine (10%) with (10%) for a total of (19%) and then converted to whole person impairment using Table 16-3, page 439 Conversion of Impairment of the Upper Extremity to Impairment of the Whole Person

Common Errors 
Error # 6 – cont’d
Double Dipping
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #7 - Following Only Part of the 
Instructions
Example: Taking 3 range of motion measurements 
(confirm that an inclinometer was utilized) but not 3 consecutive measurements when using the ROM method of spinal impairment
–Not infrequently, we review impairment rating 
reports wherein the evaluator documents that he/she has taken 4 to 6 measurements using the ROM Method for evaluating spinal impairment, however, that evaluator has not used three (more than likely only one) consecutive measurements
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #7 – cont’d
Following Only Part of the Instructions
Example - Taking 3 range of motion measurements 
(confirm that an inclinometer was utilized) but not 3 consecutive measurements when using the ROM method of spinal impairment – cont’d
–The evaluator has, instead, used three 
non-consecutive measurements that "meet" the criteria that all three measurements are within 5 degrees or 10% of the average of those three measurements
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #7 – cont’d
Following Only Part of the Instructions
Comment
–It is helpful for evaluators to take care to 
read and understand all of the instructions in each section of the AMA Guides
–The report must include protocol 
measures and identification of the ROM instrument utilized
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #8 - Misreading The Figure /Table That 
Is Being Referenced
Example: Table 15-8 AMA Guides Fifth 
Edition
–We routinely review impairment rating reports 
where the evaluator ignores the first column of Table 15-8 Impairment Due to Abnormal Motion of the Lumbar Region: Flexion and Extension" found on page 407
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #8 – cont’d
Misreading The Figure /Table That Is Being 
Referenced
Example: Table 15-8 AMA Guides Fifth 
Edition – cont’d
–This column lists three (3) choices for Sacral 
(hip) flexion angle
–Depending upon the flexion angle of the 
sacral/hip, a "true lumbar spine flexion angle" of 40 degrees will yield a percent impairment of the whole person of either 5%, 4% or 2%
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #8 – cont’d
Misreading The Figure /Table That Is Being 
Referenced
Example: Table 15-8 AMA Guides Fifth 
Edition – cont’d
–It is important for the evaluator preparing the 
report to take notice of all of the information found in any table or figure before reporting the corresponding impairment
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #8 – cont’d
Misreading The Figure /Table That Is Being 
Referenced
Example: Figure 16-40 (pie figure) Page 476
–The evaluator correctly reported that the 
examinee demonstrated active range of motion of his right shoulder to 120 degrees in Flexion and to 20 degrees in Extension
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #8 – cont’d
Misreading The Figure /Table That Is Being 
Referenced
Example: Figure 16-40 (pie figure) Page 476 – cont’d
–He then reported that "According to Fig. 16-40 
on page 476 Mr. Brown qualifies for 4% Upper Extremity lmpairment for the limitation in Flexion to 120 degrees" 
–From the same table, he qualifies for 24% Upper 
Extremity Impairment for limitation in Extension to 20 degrees"
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #8 – cont’d
Misreading The Figure /Table That Is Being 
Referenced
Example: Figure 16-40 (pie figure) Page 476 – cont’d
–The evaluator then added 4% and 24% for a 
total of 28% Upper Extremity Impairment
–He then converted the 28% Upper Extremity 
Impairment to 17% Whole Person Impairment using Table 16-3 pg 439
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #8 – cont’d
Misreading The Figure /Table That Is Being 
Referenced
The Error
–The evaluator read the wrong line of the arc
–He correctly used the "V" arc (measured angles 
of motion) for both the Flexion and the Extension measurements
–He correctly used the next arc "IF%" 
(impairment due to loss of flexion) to retrieve the correct value of 4% Upper Extremity Impairment
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #8 – cont’d
Misreading The Figure /Table That Is Being 
Referenced
The Error – cont’d
–When he then followed the "V" arc back to 20 
degrees of Extension, however, he continued to use the "lF%" arc instead of the "IE%" arc
–This error caused him to record 24% Upper 
Extremity Impairment and convert to 7% Whole Person Impairment
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #8 – cont’d
Misreading The Figure /Table That Is Being 
Referenced
The Correct Answer
4% Whole Person Impairment. 
•4% (Flexion) + 2% (Extension) = 6%
–not 24% Upper Extremity Impairment
•6% converts to 4% Whole Person Impairment
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #8 – cont’d
Misreading The Figure /Table That Is Being Referenced
Comment
–It is easy to read from the wrong line of the arc of 
the figures calculating impairment of upper extremity due to loss of range of motion
–We routinely review reports where the evaluator 
inadvertently read the correct degree of motion of the body part only to read the wrong line of the arc (flexion instead of extension, abduction instead of adduction, etc.) and thereby report an incorrect impairment value
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #9 - Rating an Individual Before 
MMI Is Reached
– The evaluator documents "acute muscle 
spasm" and "the claimant states he slipped yesterday and re-injured his back“
– The evaluator should not have rated this 
individual, as the examinee is not at Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI)
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #9 – cont’d
Rating an Individual Before MMI Is Reached
– A general principle throughout the AMA Guides is 
that "An impairment is considered permanent when it has reached maximum medical improvement 
(MMI), meaning it is well stabilized and unlikely to 
change substantially in the next year with or without medical treatment” 5th edition page 2
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #9 – cont’d
Rating an Individual Before MMI Is Reached
– A general principle throughout the AMA Guides is 
that "An impairment is considered permanent when it has reached maximum medical improvement 
(MMI), meaning it is well stabilized and unlikely to 
change substantially in the next year with or without medical treatment” 5th edition page 2
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #9 – cont’d
Rating an Individual Before MMI Is Reached
– If one (Texas) is using the AMA Guides (Fourth 
Edition), one can rate using the Injury Model/Diagnosis-Related Estimates (DRE) Model before MMI is reached, but not if using the Range of Motion (ROM) Model
– If one is using the AMA Guides (Fifth Edition), one 
cannot rate before MMI is reached using either the Injury Method/DRE Method or the Range of Motion Method
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #9 – cont’d
Rating an Individual Before MMI Is Reached
– See 15.2a Summary of Specific Procedures 
and Directions page 380 #2 “..........., it is not considered a permanent (stable) impairment and should not be rated under the Guides
criteria”
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #10 - Failure to Personally Review Computer 
Aided Measurements And Computer Generated Reports
Example: A Case of Uniformly Ankylosed Fingers
– The injury involved trauma to the right hand and 
wrist
– The "History" section of the report stated that the 
injured man had decreased motion and strength in his wrist and limited flexion of the first three fingers with normal motion in only the little finger
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #10 – cont’d
Failure to Personally Review Computer Aided 
Measurements And Computer Generated Reports
Example: A Case of Uniformly Ankylosed Fingers – cont’d
– The range of motion values for the wrist and the 
thumb looked appropriate for the injury described
– All of the fingers (including the little finger) were 
reported to have normal full motion in extension of the MP joints, but uniform ankylosis at the MP joint of all four fingers at twenty (20) degrees of flexion
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #10 – cont’d
Failure to Personally Review Computer Aided 
Measurements And Computer Generated Reports
The Error
– It seemed most unusual to this reviewer that all of the 
MP joints on the left hand identical restrictions in flexion - especially given the information that the little finger had been spared from injury
– Upon contacting the evaluator, we learned that he used 
a computer to assist him in determining the "correct" range of motion measurements as part of his evaluations
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #10 – cont’d
Failure to Personally Review Computer Aided 
Measurements And Computer Generated Reports
The Error – cont’d
– With that information, it became clear that the evaluator had 
placed the computerized measuring device on the examinee's fingers up side down
– The computer read and recorded flexion for extension and 
extension for flexion
– It then automatically made the "appropriate" calculations of the 
percent impairment, converted to hand, then regional impairment and combined those values with the other measurements to arrive an incorrect whole person impairment
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #10 – cont’d
Failure to Personally Review Computer Aided 
Measurements And Computer Generated Reports
COMMENT
– When this was pointed out to the evaluator, he 
readily admitted that reversing the sensor was the most lively the cause of the erroneous measurements
– The examinee was called back to the evaluator's 
office, reexamined, and the correct measurements were obtained
– An addendum to the impairment rating report was 
submitted

Will Your Impairment Rating (5th
edition) Report Be Considered 
Credible?
Goals
Will Your Impairment Rating 
Report Be Considered Credible?
Goals
• To assist forensic examiners in 
producing credible and quality reports
• Identify some of the criteria used by 
formally trained forensic examiners
• Identify certain practices that lead 
forensic examiners to question the credibility of reports or “IME providers”
Will Your Impairment Rating 
Report Be Considered Credible?
Goals – cont’d
• Present experience (mix of anecdotal and 
case based approach) of review criteria and common errors with case examples
• Discuss certain patterns that tend to cause 
reviewers to call into question the credibility of the report or rater
• The criteria and examples presented are 
intended to serve as "markers" which can be one of the way forensic examiners can judge the quality of their own reports
Will Your Impairment Rating (5th
edition) Report Be Considered 
Credible?
Introduction
Introduction
• An impairment rating report is a legal document
• The forensic examiner performing the 
impairment rating is usually expected to give a reasoned chiropractic (medical) opinion as to causality, degree of impairment, the permanent nature of the condition, the likelihood of progression at some point in the future, and a variety of other issues
• A good impairment rating report is expected to 
be a true and accurate reflection of the examinee's condition at the time of examination
Introduction – cont’d
• However, impairment rating reports may 
be "tailored" (executive summary) to the client and the client's needs provided that it is done within certain reasonable and ethical boundaries
• An Administrative Law Judge once stated 
"all reports are biased depending on who paid for the report"
Introduction – cont’d
• We routinely review the impairment ratings 
reports (audits) of other providers for state Workers' Compensation Funds as well as doing consulting work for attorneys representing either the claimant or the employer
• This presentation hopefully will assist forensic 
examiners in producing credible, quality reports - by familiarizing them with what happens to an impairment rating (or IME) after it’s written and submitted for use
Introduction – cont’d
• Impairment rating reports may be scrutinized 
by a variety of professionals including doctors, lawyers, nurses, claims managers, QA committees, judges, etc
– articles have indicated that up to 20 will see these 
reports
• Those who use and review impairment rating 
reports will be referred to as "reviewers“
• Experienced impairment rating reviewers form 
opinions as to the quality of reports, and also, in some instances, they form opinions as to the honesty and accuracy of the rater 
Introduction – cont’d
• Reviewers frequently form these opinions 
based on the report's apparent credibility
– which report best followed the AMA Guides 
protocol and criteria
– which showed the best documentation in 
support of the conclusions drawn by the forensic examiner
– which best documented that the forensic 
examiner had reviewed and considered all of the evidence in the medical file, etc 
Introduction – cont’d
• Most cases are decided on the manifest 
weight of the evidence, and more weight is given to reports considered most credible
Assessment Criteria
Major Criteria
Assessment Criteria
MAJOR CRITERIA
1. Was the impairment rating report 
completed and submitted in a timely manner? 
– No matter how good the report, the client 
must have a document to use by a given deadline in order for the report to be of any benefit
Major Criteria – cont’d
2. Was a complete history of the 
presenting injury/illness recorded?
– WE have reviewed reports that stated
"Mr. Johnson was injured in a motor 
vehicle accident (collision) on the way to work on January 16, 2004" 
– Obviously this report needs to have 
considerably more detail about the mechanism of injury for the report to be considered credible
Major Criteria – cont’d
2. Was a complete history of the 
presenting injury/illness recorded? –cont’d
– At the other end of the spectrum
• We have reviewed a 2 1/4 page report on 
"History of Chief Complaint" 
– only to find that two-thirds of the information 
was not related to the condition for which the individual was being rated
Major Criteria – cont’d
3. Was the physical exam appropriate to the 
condition being examined/rated?
– Once reviewed an impairment rating report where 
the only injury to the person being evaluated was his right thumb
• The IME provider submitted a ten (10) page report 
including the fact that the man had no limp and had "hearing intact to normal conversation“
• When reviewing the examination of the right hand, the 
evaluating provider measured and reported flexion/extension and abduction/adduction of the right thumb, but omitted right thumb opposition
Major Criteria – cont’d
• 4. Were the AMA Guides 5thedition 
protocol and criteria followed?
–E x a m p l e s
• 2.2 Who Performs Impairment Evaluations? Pg 
18
• 2.4 When Are Impairment Ratings Performed? 
Pg 19
• 2.5 Rules for Evaluation pg 19•2.6 Preparing Reports pg 21
• 2.6c Discuss How the Impairment Rating Was 
Calculated pg 22
Major Criteria – cont’d
5. Were other regulations/requirements 
(unique to client) followed? 
– Most parties who request an IME for 
impairment evaluation have certain requirements unique to that client
– These may take the form of 
• state or federal statutes that must be adhered to
• special rules or regulations used by the 
requesting party
• special forms or diagrams• specific declarations from the forensic 
examiner, etc
Major Criteria – cont’d
5. Were other 
regulations/requirements (unique to client) followed? – cont’d 
– The impairment rating reports must be 
"tailored" to the needs (issues) of requesting party or else the report may be of limited value to that party
– As has been stated previously, this 
"tailoring" should be done within reasonable and ethical boundaries
Major Criteria – cont’d
6.  Are the impairment calculations correct?
– An impairment rating report is considered not 
credible if the forensic examiner consistently makes errors in calculation either through 
• no formal training• ignorance• carelessness or •D e s i g n
– such that the final figures are not a true and 
accurate reflection of the facts of the case according to the AMA Guides
Major Criteria – cont’d
7. Are the forensic examiner's conclusions supported by both the 
exam findings and by the AMA Guides or a reasonable 
extrapolation of the Guides?
Example
– This type of inconsistency is illustrated by the 
report of an provider who not only documented that the examinee complained of pain in the right shoulder "which began after starting physical therapy" but also reported "tenderness to palpation of the anterior portion of the right shoulder" as well as a decrease in flexion and abduction of this joint
Major Criteria – cont’d
7. Are the forensic examiner's conclusions 
supported by both the exam findings and by the AMA Guides or a reasonable extrapolation of the Guides? – cont’d
Example – cont’d
– The provider then concluded that the 
examinee had reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) and that the gentleman had only injured his neck and upper back in the fall
Major Criteria – cont’d
8. Did the report answer the specific 
questions asked by the client?
– Most parties who request an IME for 
impairment evaluation have certain questions unique to that client or case
– Without answers to specific questions, 
an impairment rating may not be useful to the client

Common Errors 
Error #3 – cont’d
Combining Before Converting
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #3 – cont’d
Combining Before Converting
The Error
– Page 512, 16.9 Summary of Steps for 
Evaluating Impairments of the Upper Extremity, clearly states under part IX "When both upper extremities are involved, derive the whole person impairment percent for each and then combine both values using the Combined Values Chart (pgs 604-606)"
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #3 – cont’d
Combining Before Converting
The Correct Answer
– When the instructions are followed, (10%) 
Upper Extremity Impairment converts to 6% whole person Impairment
– Then the Combined Values Chart, shows that 
6% combined with 6% equals 12% whole person impairment
• not the 11% that was originally recommended
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #4 - Adding Instead of Combining
Example: Decreased Range of Motion in the 
Hip and the Knee of the Left Lower Extremity
–The examinee was found to have 74 degrees of 
flexion in his left knee and 9 degrees of ankylosis in flexion of his left hip
–The evaluator reported that the 74 degrees of 
flexion in his left knee equated to 8% Whole Person Impairment according to Table 17-10 Knee Impairment (page 537) which shows "Moderate" restriction of motion (Less than 80 degrees)
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #4 – cont’d
Adding Instead of Combining
Example – cont’d
–He then reported that the ankylosis of the 
hip equated to 15% Whole Person Impairment according to Table 17-15 Impairment Due to Ankylosis in Hip Flexion, (page 538) 
–The evaluator then reported that the 
examinee had a "total of 23% WPI (knee + hip)"
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #4 – cont’d
Adding Instead of Combining
The Error
–Page 528, 17.2a Converting from Lower 
Extremity to Whole Person Impairment states "....Similarly, when using separate methods on the same region, combine the regional impairments before converting to a whole person impairment rating” and combine the whole person impairment using the Combined Values Chart (pgs 604-606)
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #4 – cont’d
Adding Instead of Combining
The Correct Answer
– Check Table 17-2 page 526 Guide to the 
Appropriate Combination of Evaluation Methods (cross-usage chart) first
– Ankylosis and ROM can be combined– According to the Combined Values Chart, p 
604, 15% combined with 8% equals 22%
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #4 – cont’d
Adding Instead of Combining
Comment
–In general the AMA Guides 5th edition 
recommends combining and not adding whenever there are different types of impairment in the same body part or when there is any impairment in different body parts (even when those body parts are in the same region)
–There are exceptions to this rule and the AMA 
Guides usually give special instructions to the evaluator when adding is recommended
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #5 - Combining Instead of 
Adding
Example: The Injured Thumb
–The injured worker in question got his 
right thumb caught in a press
–After three surgeries and an extensive 
recovery period, he was ready for an impairment rating
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #5 – cont’d
Combining Instead of Adding
Example: The Injured Thumb – cont’d
–The evaluator correctly measured the various motions of 
the thumb and found the correct values for "thumb impairment" as follows:
•IP Joint - Flexion of 10% is [6%] thumb impairment and 
Extension of 0% is [0%] thumb impairment for a total of [7%] thumb impairment for the IP joint
•MP Joint - Flexion of 20% is [7%] thumb impairment and 
Extension of 0% is [0%] thumb impairment for a total of [7% ] thumb impairment for the MP joint
•CMC Joint - Radial abduction of 20% is [7%] thumb 
impairment. Adduction of 4 cm is [20%] thumb impairment. Opposition of 2.5 cm is [40%] thumb impairment. This gives a total thumb impairment of [67%] for the CMC joint
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #5 – cont’d
Combining Instead of Adding
Example: The Injured Thumb – cont’d
–The evaluator then combined the thumb 
impairment values for the different joints of the thumb as follows:
67% c 7% = 69%
69% c 4% = 70% thumb impairment
70% converts to 28% hand impairment Table 16-1 
pg 438
28% converts to 25% upper extremity impairment 
Table 16-2 pg 439
25% converts to 15%
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #5 – cont’d
Combining Instead of Adding
The Error
–The evaluator combined instead of adding 
all of the joints of the thumb
–This changed the final WPI
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #5 – cont’d
Combining Instead of Adding
The Correct Answer
67 + 7 + 4 = 78% thumb impairment78% converts to 31% hand impairment 
Table Table 16-1 pg 438
31% converts to 28% upper extremity 
impairment 16-2 pg 439
28% converts to 17%  whole person 
impairment Table 16-3 pg 439
Common Errors – cont’d
Error #5 – cont’d
Combining Instead of Adding
COMMENT
–Photocopying and using Figure I6-1a and b 
Upper Extremity Impairment Evaluation Record - Part I and 2 pgs 436-437, as instructed on page 511, 16.9 Summary of Steps for Evaluating Impairments of the Upper Extremity is always useful to prevent this type of error, even when only one digit is involved
–While it is true that, in general, the AMA Guides 
5
thedition instructs the evaluator to combine 
impairment values from different joints, the thumb is a notable exception
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 6 - Double Dipping
Example: Flexion Contracture of the Hip
–The gentleman being examined had developed 
arthritis of the left hip secondary to an old fracture of the acetabulum
–The evaluator measured the flexion contracture 
at 30 degrees from the table
–The hip was able to move in flexion from the 30 
degrees position to 130 degrees
•The evaluator recorded the impairment as 8% Whole 
Person Impairment due to the flexion contracture as found in Table 17-9 Hip Motion Impairment on page 537
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 6 – cont’d
Double Dipping
Example: Flexion Contracture of the Hip – cont’d
–He then added an additional 2% WPI due to the 
fact that the total range of motion of the hip was less than 100 degrees which is listed as "Mild" impairment of the hip, and is assigned 2% (5%) in the same table as was found the flexion contracture values
–This was then reported as 10% WPI based on 
motion loss of the left hip
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 6 – cont’d
Double DippingThe Error
–The evaluator was actually "double dipping“
–The flexion of the hip was normal at 130 
degrees
–The impairment was accurately reflected in 
the 8% WPI for flexion contracture
–The evaluator was in error to have 
considered the hip flexion to be restricted
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 6 – cont’d
Double Dipping
The Correct Answer
–8% WPI for motion loss of the left hip
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 6 – cont’d
Double Dipping
Comment
–This is but one example of "double dipping“
–Other examples would include, but not be limited 
to the following
•using both gait disturbance and range of motion (since 
gait cannot be used with any other way of classifying impairment of the lower extremity)
•using both muscle weakness and range of motion (since 
both are a measure of function), and 
Common Errors – cont’d
Error # 6 – cont’d
Double Dipping
Comment – cont’d
•using a percentage for partial meniscectomy 
of the left knee from an earlier operation and then adding an additional percentage for a total meniscectomy (medial and lateral) of the left knee from a subsequent operation (since the percentage for the total meniscectomy would cover any impairment percent from the previous operation)

apportionment by cause is based on whether the available 
methods allow it to be done reasonably accurately and on whether the outcome is fair to the parties

AGGRAVATION AND SUSCEPTIBILITY• A special case of apportionment by cause is 
assessment of the relative contribution of an occupational cause in situations where there is a pre existing disorder
• In such cases, a disease or condition that does not 
cause total impairment is made worse by the occupational exposure to the extent that significant additional disability results

• The aggravation may be temporary or permanent• Although both may result in lost time from work 
and impairment, it is obvious that the latter is of most importance in the compensation setting
• In a least one important American case, this 
problem was further divided into two situations

•In the first situation, the pre existing condition 
was latent or, at least, not incapacitating
• The occupational exposure made the condition 
worse or in some way added to the effects of the condition so that the resulting disability was much greater than would have occurred with the natural 
history of the pre existing condition

AGGRAVATION AND SUSCEPTIBILITY – cont’dExample• A person with well-controlled asthma working in a workplace 
with solvent or isocyanate exposure may find that the irritant effects or the development of sensitization to isocyanate makes the asthma more difficult to manage, and therefore, the capacity to work at that occupation is lost
– In this situation, the apportionment theory holds that while 
the pre existing condition may have contributed to the final disability, it did so because of the effects of the occupational exposure

Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
The Epidemiologic Approach
•A rational approach to apportionment by cause 
might be to apportion by the contribution of each risk factor to disease outcome using epidemiologic studies
• This approach is actually highly complex because 
risk estimates are uncertain, describe the experience of a population (not the risk of an individual), and do not act in isolation
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
•Epidemiologic studies measure the risk in a 
population that is associated with exposure to a risk 
factor, itself either a presumed determinant of the disease outcome or a marker for some other determinant
• These risk estimates are invaluable as an indication 
of the direction and magnitude of an association between the risk factor and the outcome, but they are not necessarily valid when applied to individual members of the population
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
•In the absence of any information specific to the 
individual or a well defined subgroup, the population 
risk estimate only represents the single best estimate of what the risk would be for members of the group chosen at random
• Moreover, although risks derived from populations 
may provide estimates for an individual, any given individual may not approximate the "average" of a population under study
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
•Additionally, population estimates are dynamic
– risk levels in industry change as new technology 
and methods are introduced
– different populations may show strikingly different 
risk profiles
•E x a m p l e
– Ontario gold miners once showed marked elevations in 
their risk for lung cancer and silicosis, presumably due to silica exposure, but these findings have not been replicated since the late 1950s

• Furthermore, epidemiologic estimates of risk are 
not consistently accurate or robust
• In fact, risk estimates vary greatly and often have 
wide confidence intervals
• They are also unavailable for many chronic 
morbid outcomes such as chronic non malignant respiratory diseases that cannot be determined from mortality statistics

Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
• The best estimate of risk derived from an 
epidemiologic study applicable to a particular case is the risk associated with the age, sex, and duration of exposure (and level of exposure, if such information is available) that most closely approximates the claimant and his or her experience
• Unfortunately, most published studies cannot 
support analysis at this level of detail because the results are not reported in sufficient detail
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
• Furthermore, the estimates become very 
uncertain (because of small numbers) when 
broken down in this manner
• Given this limitation, it is common practice, but 
not strictly correct, for the risk estimate for the total population to be used indiscriminately, applying it to the individual without taking other characteristics into account
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d

The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
•The risk estimate applies to the population 
as a whole and represents only an estimate for any given member of that population

•A risk estimate derived from the mean for

The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
•It is known that the best estimate of the absolute 
risk for one person of developing a disorder is approximately the mean risk for the population as a whole for "rare" diseases, such as cancers, but not necessarily for common diseases
– Dupont WD. Plummer WD Tr. Understanding the relationship between 
relative and absolute risk.  Cancer 1996; 77:2193-2199

greater uncertainty surrounding the best estimate

The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
•The risk estimate is usually expressed in 
terms of relative risk, as a ratio of the risk of the population exposed to a risk factor under study compared with an unexposed population

number in apportioning risk by cause

The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
• What one would like to know is the relative 
contribution of each cause to the total excess risk 
of the outcome, or what might be called the proportionate attributable risk
• In epidemiologic terms, this is the fraction 
represented by the attributable risk of each risk factor over the total excess or attributable risk for the population, which is almost never known

Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
• Usually the best one can do is compare relative 
attributable risks (basically, the relative risk minus 
1) for each suspected cause or, more crudely, the relative magnitude of the relative risks for each suspected cause
• This is not very satisfactory because every 
significant risk factor is not always accounted for in any one study, and risk factors are likely to be confounded in any one study
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d

The Epidemiologic Approach – cont’d
•Often, one must use figures from more 
than one study, presuming that the estimates are reasonably accurate

Practical ProblemsIn addition to these theoretical problems, a number of 
practical problems are associated with using epidemiologic estimates of risk to apportion risk by cause:
•Risk estimates are uncertain because of statistical error
(and usually are expressed with confidence intervals)
– How does one take this uncertainty into account in 
apportioning risk by cause?

•“Risk factors” are often markers for another 
exposure that is more important as a cause (eg., 
alcohol is associated with lung cancer risk because people who drink are likely to smoke)
– How can this be taken into account, especially 
if there is uncertainty or the problem has not been studied?

• This approach can be done in two ways: 
1.  by attempting to isolate the best applicable

• The approach of adjusting the epidemiologic risk

• Statistical uncertainty usually results in wide

• At the very least, they are able to individualize

• Because of all these drawbacks,

• Its principal drawback is that no systematic

Abstract
This article reviews research on the use of diet, nutritional 
supplements, and hormones in the treatment of epilepsy. 
Potentially beneficial dietary interventions include identifying 
and treating blood glucose dysregulation, identifying and 
avoiding allergenic foods, and avoiding suspected triggering 
agents such as alcohol, aspartame, and monosodium 
glutamate. The ketogenic diet may be considered for severe, 
treatment-resistant cases. The Atkins diet (very low in 
carbohydrates) is a less restrictive type of ketogenic diet that 
may be effective in some cases. Nutrients that may reduce 
seizure frequency include vitamin B6, magnesium, vitamin E, 
manganese, taurine, dimethylglycine, and omega-3 fatty acids. 
Administration of thiamine may improve cognitive function in 
patients with epilepsy. Supplementation with folic acid, vitamin 
B6, biotin, vitamin D, and L-carnitine may be needed to prevent 
or treat deficiencies resulting from the use of anticonvulsant 
drugs. Vitamin K1 has been recommended near the end of 
pregnancy for women taking anticonvulsants. Melatonin may 
reduce seizure frequency in some cases, and progesterone 
may be useful for women with cyclic exacerbations of seizures. 
In most cases, nutritional therapy is not a substitute for 
anticonvulsant medications. However, in selected cases, 
depending on the effectiveness of the interventions, dosage 
reductions or discontinuation of medications may be possible.
(Altern Med Rev  2007;12(1):-24)Introduction
Epilepsy is a disorder of brain electrical activity 
that results in recurrent seizures. The type of seizure de -
pends on the portion of the brain affected. While there 
are many different causes of seizures, including brain 
tumor, head injury, stroke, and alcohol withdrawal, the 
discussion in this article is limited mainly to cases in 
which the cause is idiopathic (primary epilepsy).
Conventional treatment of epilepsy consists 
primarily of anticonvulsant medications. Although 
these drugs often control or reduce the frequency of sei -
zures, some patients show little or no improvement.
A number of dietary modifications, nutritional 
supplements, and hormones have been found to be ben -
eficial for some patients with epilepsy.
Potentially useful dietary interventions include 
measures to stabilize blood glucose levels, identifica -
tion and avoidance of allergenic foods, and avoidance 
of potential inciting agents (such as ethanol and aspar -
tame). The ketogenic diet has been successful for many 
patients, but because of its highly restrictive nature and 
potential to cause significant adverse effects, its use is 
restricted to severe cases that fail to respond to other 
treatments. A less restrictive version of the ketogenic 
diet, the Atkins diet, has shown promise and deserves 
further study.
Several different nutrients (and two hormones) 
may also be beneficial in selected patients with epilep -
sy. The fact that nutritional factors are involved in the 
regulation of electrical activity in the brain is indicated

Epilepsy
Page 10by the fact that severe deficiency of thiamine, mag -
nesium, or vitamin B6 can cause seizures. A subnor -
mal concentration of each of these nutrients has been 
found to be common in patients with epilepsy. While 
the severity of these deficiencies is probably not great 
enough in most cases to cause seizures in otherwise 
healthy people, marginal status with respect to any of 
these nutrients could conceivably exacerbate a seizure 
disorder due to another cause.
In addition, some patients with epilepsy 
might have a higher-than-normal requirement for 
one or more nutrients that play a role in brain elec -
trical activity. That phenomenon has been clearly 
demonstrated in the case of vitamin B6-dependent 
epilepsy, a condition in which intractable seizures can 
be completely controlled by administration of large 
doses of vitamin B6. The existence of this relatively 
rare syndrome raises the possibility that more subtle 
forms of nutrient dependency occur more commonly. 
While mildly or moderately increased requirements 
for vitamin B6 or other nutrients may not by them -
selves be sufficient to cause seizures, a failure to meet 
these increased requirements could aggravate an ex -
isting seizure disorder.
Some studies have found that supplemen -
tation with individual nutrients reduced seizure fre -
quency or improved other aspects of health in patients 
with epilepsy, but other studies have failed to confirm 
those findings. Administration of combinations of 
nutrients might be more effective than supplementing 
with a single nutrient, but that possibility has largely 
been unexplored. Nutrient supplementation may also 
be necessary to prevent or reverse the effects of cer -
tain deficiencies that frequently result from the use of 
anticonvulsant drugs. The potential benefits of nutri -
ent supplementation in patients with epilepsy must 
be weighed against reports that large doses of certain 
nutrients (such as vitamin B6 and folic acid) can in -
terfere with the effects of anticonvulsants.
Because there are many different types of ep -
ilepsy, a nutritional intervention that is helpful for one 
patient may not be beneficial for another. Some stud -
ies did not specify the types of epilepsy being treated, 
so it is difficult to generalize results. Nevertheless, 
natural approaches to the treatment of epilepsy show 
promise and should be considered as part of the over -
all treatment of epilepsy.Dietary Factors
Hypoglycemia/Hyperinsulinemia 
Seizures are a known manifestation of hypo -
glycemia.1,2 In patients with epilepsy, hypoglycemia 
might decrease the threshold for seizure development. 
In one study of 92 patients with epilepsy, 56.4 percent 
were found to have a subnormal fasting blood glucose 
concentration.3
In addition, transient EEG abnormalities have 
been observed in some patients during a glucose toler -
ance test. These abnormalities occurred, not when the 
blood glucose level was at its lowest point, but at a time 
that insulin levels would have been expected to be ele -
vated.4 These EEG changes were hypothesized to result 
from insulin-induced transport of water and electro -
lytes into the brain, leading to cerebral hyperosmolality. 
While the observed EEG changes were not necessarily 
of the type associated with seizures, these findings raise 
the possibility that hyperinsulinemia could trigger sei -
zures in patients with epilepsy.
Thus, hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia 
might each contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy 
in some cases. Patients with epilepsy who have evidence 
of these abnormalities might benefit from nutritional 
interventions, such as avoiding refined sugar, caffeine, 
and alcohol; eating frequently; consuming adequate 
amounts of protein; and supplementing with chromi -
um, other trace minerals, magnesium, and B vitamins.
Food Allergy 
In case reports, specific foods were implicated 
in epilepsy causation;5 the avoidance of symptom-evok -
ing foods resulted in a reduction in seizure frequency 
or elimination of seizures.6,7 In a study of 63 children 
with epilepsy, identification and avoidance of allergenic 
foods was frequently successful for patients who had 
other symptoms suggestive of allergy, but not for chil -
dren who had epilepsy alone.
For four weeks, 63 children with epilepsy un -
derwent an elimination diet consisting of lamb, chicken, 
potato, rice, banana, apple, cabbage, sprouts, cauliflower, 
broccoli, cucumber, celery, carrots, parsnips, water, salt, 
pepper, pure herbs, calcium, and vitamins. Of 18 chil -
dren who had epilepsy alone, none improved. The other 
45 children with epilepsy also had recurrent migraines, 
abdominal symptoms, or hyperkinetic behavior. Of

Page 11those children, 55.6 percent stopped having seizures 
and an additional 24.4 percent had fewer seizures dur -
ing diet therapy (a total of 80 percent with complete or 
partial resolution of seizures). Headaches, abdominal 
pains, and hyperkinetic behavior resolved in all patients 
whose seizures resolved, as well as in some patients who 
continued to have seizures. Symptoms were evoked by 
42 different foods, and seizures occurred after ingestion 
of 31 different foods. Most children reacted to several 
foods. Both generalized epilepsy (including myoclonic 
seizures and petit mal) and partial epilepsy improved on 
the diet. In double-blind, placebo-controlled food chal -
lenges, symptoms recurred in 15 of 16 children, includ -
ing seizures in eight cases, after ingestion of offending 
foods; whereas, no symptoms recurred when placebo 
was given.8
The prevalence of celiac disease has been found 
to be higher in patients with epilepsy than in controls 
(1/44 versus 1/244, respectively).9 Seizures have im -
proved in patients with celiac disease who consumed 
a gluten-free diet,10 but only when the diet was started 
soon after the onset of epilepsy.11 Most epileptic pa -
tients with celiac disease did not have gastrointestinal 
symptoms at the time of presentation, so testing for ce -
liac disease should be considered even in the absence of 
such symptoms. Some patients with epilepsy and celiac 
disease have also been found to have cerebral calcifica -
tions,12-14 the significance of which is not clear.
Dietary Inciting Factors 
In some cases, epileptic seizures have been trig -
gered by excessive alcohol intake.15
T wo case reports indicate ingestion of mono -
sodium glutamate appeared to trigger or exacerbate sei -
zures in children.16
Grand mal seizures have occurred after con -
sumption of aspartame by people who had no prior 
history of epilepsy.17,18 Ingestion of a drink containing 
aspartame (40 mg/kg body weight) also exacerbated 
EEG spike-wave discharges in children with a history 
of absence seizures.19
However, in trials funded by the NutraSweet 
Company (the manufacturer of aspartame), adminis -
tration of aspartame (34 mg/kg/day for two weeks or a 
single dose of 50 mg/kg) did not provoke seizures in pa -
tients with epilepsy or in people who reported a history of aspartame-induced seizures.20,21 A potential limita -
tion of these trials is that aspartame was administered in 
capsules, rather than in soft drinks or other aspartame-
containing foods or beverages. As aspartame in com -
mercial products is said to undergo chemical changes on 
exposure to high temperatures or after storage for more 
than two months, these degradation products may be 
partly responsible for the reported adverse effects of as -
partame.22 Therefore, symptoms that occur after inges -
tion of aspartame-containing commercial products or 
hot drinks to which aspartame has been added may not 
be reproducible by challenging with aspartame in cap -
sules. Based on the available evidence, aspartame should 
be considered a potential trigger for seizures and should 
be excluded during an elimination diet.
Ketogenic Diet 
The ketogenic diet has been used since 1921 
to control seizures in children who do not respond to 
anticonvulsant medications.23-31 The diet is calorie-re -
stricted and provides a ratio of fat to (carbohydrate + 
protein) ranging from 2:1 to 5:1. The proportion of to -
tal energy derived from fat ranges from 82-92 percent. 
Consuming a ketogenic diet produces a state of keto -
sis, which helps control seizures through an unknown 
mechanism. Fluid intake is restricted to maintain urine 
specific gravity at 1.020-1.025, since fluid intake dilutes 
blood ketones.
In different studies, 40-70 percent of patients 
following the diet experienced at least a 50-percent re -
duction in seizure frequency, and 10-33 percent became 
seizure-free. In many cases, medications could be dis -
continued or the dosages decreased. T wo children with 
acquired epileptic aphasia were also successfully treated 
with this diet.32 According to some research, myoclonic 
epilepsy responds best to the ketogenic diet.26 However, 
another study found that the response to the diet did 
not vary significantly according to seizure type.25 The 
diet is most effective in children ages 2-5 years, although 
patients of other ages have also benefited.26
T o be effective, the diet must be followed strict -
ly; if the patient discontinues it, seizures are likely to 
return within hours. T ypically, treatment is initiated in 
the hospital, starting with a 36-hour water fast to in -
duce ketosis; however, some investigators have found 
that it is not necessary to begin the diet with a fast.

Epilepsy
Page 12The ketogenic diet is usually followed for about 
two years, after which the proportion of fat is reduced 
gradually over 6-9 months to that of a regular diet. Af -
ter a patient has been on the diet for two years, seizures 
are less likely to recur on resumption of a normal diet. 
In some cases, the diet regimen is repeated if seizures 
recur.
There are some drawbacks to the ketogenic 
diet. Supplementation with multivitamins, calcium, and 
iron is necessary to prevent nutritional deficiencies. In 
addition, the ketogenic diet is unpalatable and is diffi -
cult for parents to administer. 
Ketogenic Diet for Adults
While most ketogenic diet studies have been 
conducted in children, one trial investigated its effect in 
11 adults (ages 19-45 years; median, 32.2 years) with 
refractory epilepsy. At eight months of follow-up, three 
patients had a 90-percent reduction in seizure frequen -
cy compared with baseline, three patients had a 50- to 
89-percent decrease, and one patient had a less-than-
50-percent decrease. All types of seizures responded to 
the diet. Common adverse effects included constipation, 
menstrual irregularities, and increases in triglyceride 
levels and cholesterol/HDL ratios.33
Ketogenic Diet with Medium-chain 
Triglycerides 
The triglycerides of octanoic and decanoic ac -
ids (medium-chain triglycerides; MCT s) are more ke -
togenic than long-chain triglycerides present in dietary 
fats. Diets containing large proportions of MCT s (usu -
ally provided by supplementing with MCT oil) are also 
easier to prepare, more palatable, better tolerated, and 
require less carbohydrate and protein restriction than 
standard ketogenic diets.
The MCT ketogenic diet, which provides 50-
70 percent of total energy in the form of MCT s, has 
been used as an alternative to the classic ketogenic 
diet.34-36 In one study, adherence to this diet resulted 
in improvement or complete control of seizures in 44 
percent of 50 children with drug-resistant epilepsy.37 
Children who have had a positive response to this diet 
may be able to taper off the diet after 3-4 years without 
experiencing a recurrence of seizures. While the MCT 
diet is frequently well tolerated, some patients abandon 
it because of gastrointestinal intolerance.Ketogenic Diet: Adverse Effects
The ketogenic diet has caused a number of ad -
verse effects, some serious. Initiation of the diet can re -
sult in vomiting, hypoglycemia, or dehydration. In one 
study, serious adverse events (severe hypoproteinemia, 
Fanconi’s renal tubular acidosis, or marked abnormali -
ties on liver function tests) occurred in five of 52 chil -
dren on a ketogenic diet.38 Other potential side effects 
include increased bruising or other minor bleeding (in 
association with a prolonged bleeding time), constipa -
tion, and diarrhea.39,40
Long-term problems include moderate growth 
retardation, renal stones (5-8% of cases), gallstones, 
acidosis or metabolic problems (particularly during ill -
ness), recurrent infections, hypercholesterolemia, hy -
peruricemia, vitamin deficiency, and feeding problems. 
Prolonged ketosis may raise the serum level of pheno -
barbitone, which can result in alopecia, renal stones, and 
growth retardation.36
The ketogenic diet and anticonvulsant drugs 
both have an adverse effect on bone density, which can 
be partially reversed with vitamin D supplementation. 
Carnitine deficiency may also occur with the ketogenic 
diet, particularly in patients taking valproic acid. L-car -
nitine supplementation is recommended for patients 
who have low serum carnitine levels.41
Patients on the ketogenic diet must be moni -
tored closely by a practitioner experienced in its use.
Atkins Diet 
The Atkins diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-
fat diet used by millions of people for weight reduction. 
Like the ketogenic diet, the Atkins diet can induce a 
state of ketosis, but it has fewer restrictions on calories 
and protein. In addition, the Atkins diet does not re -
quire fluid restriction and does not need to be started 
in the hospital. 
According to one study, the Atkins diet may 
be an effective alternative to the ketogenic diet in some 
children with intractable epilepsy. T wenty children 
(ages 3-18 years) with intractable epilepsy, with at least 
three seizures per week, who had been treated with at 
least two anticonvulsants, followed a modified Atkins 
diet (nature of the modification not specified) over a 
six-month period. Carbohydrates were limited to 10 
g/day for the first month and consumption of fats was

Page 13 encouraged. All children received vitamin and calcium 
supplements. At six months, 13 patients (65%) had 
more than 50-percent improvement and seven patients 
(35%) had more than 90-percent improvement (four 
were seizure-free). Small increases were seen in serum 
cholesterol and blood urea nitrogen levels during the 
study.42
In another study, two adults (ages 42 and 52) 
with epilepsy showed no improvement on the Atkins 
diet.43 T able 1 weighs the evidence for various dietary/
metabolic interventions.
Nutritional Supplements
Vitamin B6 
Experimentally-induced vitamin B6 deficiency 
resulted in seizures in rats44 and swine.45 In the early 
1950s, numerous infants in the United States devel -
oped convulsions traced to the use of a formula that was 
deficient in pyridoxine.46,47 Seizures also occurred in an 
infant fed exclusively on powdered goat’s milk, which 
had undetectable levels of the vitamin. The seizures re -
solved after supplementation with vitamin B6.48
Vitamin B6 deficiency has been found in a high 
proportion of patients with epilepsy. Of 62 drug-treat -
ed epileptic patients, 55 percent had a subnormal blood 
level of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP).49 In a study of 68 
institutionalized patients with severe epilepsy, 37 per -
cent had a reduced serum concentration of pyridoxal.50 
Low levels of vitamin B6 may be due in part to treat -
ment with phenytoin, which has been associated with 
laboratory evidence of reduced vitamin B6 status (i.e., increased xanthurenic acid excretion following a tryp -
tophan load).51 However, other factors may be involved 
as well, since there does not appear to be a strong rela -
tionship between low vitamin B6 levels and use of any 
specific anticonvulsant medication.
Vitamin B6 supplementation is clearly benefi -
cial in cases of vitamin B6-dependent seizures. Some 
studies have demonstrated improvements in patients 
with non-vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy as well, al -
though the research has produced conflicting results.
Vitamin B6-dependent Seizures 
Vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy is a rare inher -
ited disorder that usually presents with intractable sei -
zures in the first six months of life. The seizures can be 
completely controlled by administration of large doses 
of vitamin B6,52,53 but if the condition is not treated 
promptly irreversible neurological damage may occur.
The diagnosis of vitamin B6 dependency can 
be established by intravenous administration of pyri -
doxine, which results in cessation of seizures within 
minutes. Intravenous administration of vitamin B6 to 
infants after a long period of convulsions has been fol -
lowed in some cases by acute hypotonia; in one case as -
sisted ventilation was required.54 For that reason, resus -
citation equipment should be available during a trial of 
intravenous vitamin B6.
Most patients can subsequently be maintained 
on 25-50 mg/day oral pyridoxine, although one child 
required 200 mg/day.55 Long-term supplementation is 
necessary; discontinuation of pyridoxine after several Dietary or Metabolic Factors

Epilepsy
Page 14years of good seizure control has resulted in death from 
status epilepticus.
Some patients with vitamin B6-dependent sei -
zures present with an atypical picture, including later 
onset (up to 19 months of age),56,57 a seizure-free period 
before administration of pyridoxine, a long remission 
after withdrawal of pyridoxine, and an atypical seizure 
type. Because the spectrum of vitamin B6-dependent 
seizures is broader than initially thought, it has been 
recommended that a trial of vitamin B6 be considered 
in all infants and young children with intractable epi -
lepsy.58
It is also recommended that women who have 
a child with vitamin B6 dependency receive vitamin B6 
supplements during subsequent pregnancies.
Vitamin B6 for Non-vitamin B6-dependent 
Epilepsy 
Vitamin B6 supplementation has been report -
ed to be beneficial in some, but not all, studies of pa -
tients with non-vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy.
T wenty-six children with epilepsy received 160 
mg/day pyridoxine. Of the 19 patients with laboratory 
evidence of vitamin B6 deficiency (i.e., increased uri -
nary excretion of xanthurenic acid following a trypto -
phan load), nine had complete or partial amelioration of 
seizures, and some of these patients were able to discon -
tinue anticonvulsant medication. Of the seven patients 
with a normal tryptophan load test, none responded to 
pyridoxine.59
Of three children (ages 3-8 years) with epilepsy 
associated with impaired intellectual development, pro -
gressive emotional disturbances, and abnormal EEGs, 
all excreted elevated amounts of xanthurenic acid after 
a tryptophan load. After administration of 60-160 mg 
pyridoxine daily, tryptophan metabolism became nor -
mal and substantial clinical improvement occurred.60
Pyridoxine (20 mg, 3-6 times daily) was given 
for an unspecified length of time to 14 epileptic patients, 
ages 2-17 years. All patients had petit mal and one also 
had grand mal epilepsy. Seizures ceased in five patients 
and became less frequent in three others.61
Fifty-six epileptic children received 160-200 
mg pyridoxine daily for at least six weeks. Significant 
clinical improvement was seen in five cases.62A 23-year-old man with recurrent seizures 
presented with status epilepticus, which resolved imme -
diately following intravenous administration of 60 mg 
PLP . Prior to treatment, his serum pyridoxine concen -
tration was markedly decreased (80% below the lower 
limit of normal).63
Pyridoxine was given intravenously to infants 
and children with acute, recurrent seizures due primar -
ily to acute infections. A dose of 30 or 50 mg/kg/day 
was administered in 100-250 mL of 10-percent glucose 
over 2-4 hours and given for a few days. Anti-epileptic 
drugs were used as appropriate. The treatment was rated 
“very effective” (i.e., duration and frequency of seizures 
decreased by more than 75 percent after 24 hours) in 
62.5 percent of patients receiving pyridoxine compared 
with 26 percent of control patients (p<0.001); both 
doses of pyridoxine were equally effective. Aside from 
transient flushing, no adverse effects were seen.64
In other studies, pyridoxine in doses of 20-100 
mg/day orally65,66 or 300 mg/day parenterally67 pro -
duced no clinical improvement in patients with various 
types of epilepsy.
Pyridoxine versus Pyridoxal Phosphate
While most patients with vitamin B6-depen -
dent seizures can be effectively treated with pyridoxine, 
some patients have only responded to PLP , the biologi -
cally active form of vitamin B6.68,69 The average effective 
oral dose in six patients with PLP-responsive seizures 
was 30 mg/kg/day (range, 7-38 mg/kg/day), which 
was significantly higher than the average effective pyri -
doxine dose (18 mg/kg/day) in pyridoxine respond -
ers.70 Because of superior efficacy in certain cases, PLP 
should be considered for first-line treatment of patients 
in whom a clinical trial of vitamin B6 is indicated. PLP 
should also be considered for patients with suspected 
vitamin B6-responsive seizures that are unresponsive to 
pyridoxine.
Vitamin B6 in Clinical Practice 
Vitamin B6 should be tried in all infants and 
young children with intractable epilepsy. For children 
and adults whose seizures are well controlled on medi -
cation, moderate doses of vitamin B6 (such as 10-50 
mg/day) may be considered to prevent possible drug-
induced vitamin B6 deficiency. Although larger doses

Page 15might be appropriate in selected cases, high-dose vita -
min B6 appears to interfere with some anticonvulsant 
medications. In one study, supplementation with 80-
200 mg/day pyridoxine reduced serum phenytoin and 
phenobarbitone levels in epileptic children.71 In addi -
tion, long-term administration of 500 mg/day or more 
of pyridoxine has resulted in neurotoxicity in some 
adults,72 which could presumably occur at lower doses 
in children.
One practitioner found that supplementation 
with 600 mg/day vitamin B6 reversed phenytoin-in -
duced gingival hyperplasia in several patients; however, 
such high doses are probably excessive for most patients 
with epilepsy.73 Lower doses might be effective for phe -
nytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia, particularly when 
used in combination with a folic acid mouth rinse (see 
below).
Patients being treated with vitamin B6 should 
probably also receive a magnesium supplement, in view 
of evidence that these nutrients work together and an -
ecdotal reports that vitamin B6 supplementation in -
creases the requirement for magnesium.
Magnesium 
Severe magnesium depletion can cause sei -
zures74,75 or increase susceptibility to seizure-inducing 
stimuli.76 Intravenously infused magnesium exerted an 
anticonvulsant effect against experimentally-induced 
epileptic foci in cats and dogs.77 In humans, parenter -
ally administered magnesium is an effective treatment 
for the seizures of neonatal tetany78 and eclampsia and 
possibly for those associated with ethanol withdrawal 
and acute intermittent porphyria.79
Magnesium concentrations in serum and ce -
rebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly lower in 40 
patients with grand mal epilepsy than in controls.80,81 
Serum and CSF magnesium levels fell with increasing 
duration and frequency of seizures. Oral administra -
tion of magnesium has been associated in some cases 
with an improvement in EEG findings and a reduction 
in seizure frequency.82
Vitamin E
Erythrocyte or plasma vitamin E concentra -
tions were lower in children with epilepsy than in 
healthy controls. Vitamin E levels were lower in children 
receiving multi-drug therapy than in children receiving single-drug therapy.83,84 In some studies, vitamin E sup -
plementation reduced seizure frequency, although no 
improvement was seen in other studies.
T wenty-four children (ages 6-17 years) with 
treatment-resistant epilepsy were randomly assigned to 
receive, in double-blind fashion, 400 IU/day d-alpha-
tocopheryl acetate or placebo for three months. Of the 
12 patients given vitamin E, 10 had a greater-than-60-
percent reduction in seizure frequency (of that 10, six 
had a 90-100% reduction). None of the patients in the 
placebo group had a greater-than-60-percent reduction 
in seizure frequency (p<0.05 for the difference in re -
sponse rate between groups). Vitamin E treatment had 
no effect on plasma levels of anticonvulsant medica -
tions.85
Thirty-five epileptic children and adults were 
randomly assigned to receive, in double-blind fashion, 
250 IU/day vitamin E or placebo for three months. 
Anticonvulsants were continued as previously. Of the 
12 adults receiving vitamin E, eight had a decrease in 
seizure frequency, two had an increase, and two were 
unchanged. Of the six children receiving vitamin E, two 
had a reduction in seizure frequency and four had no 
change. No changes were seen in the children and adults 
receiving placebo.86
In a double-blind study published as an ab -
stract, supplementation with vitamin E reduced mean 
seizure frequency by 32 percent (p=0.03) in a group of 
severely mentally handicapped patients with treatment-
resistance epilepsy. However, information was omitted 
regarding the dosage regimen and the response in the 
placebo group.87
In a study of 10 severely handicapped epilep -
tic patients (ages 4-23 years) receiving anticonvulsants, 
supplementation with 100 IU/day dl-alpha-tocopheryl 
acetate for one month had no effect on seizure frequen -
cy.88
Forty-three teenagers and adults with uncon -
trolled epilepsy were randomly assigned to receive, in 
double-blind fashion, 600 IU/day vitamin E or pla -
cebo for three months. After a one-week washout pe -
riod, each patient received the alternate treatment for 
an additional three months. Anticonvulsant medica -
tions were continued as previously. The mean seizure 
frequency decreased by 25.7 percent during the placebo 
period and by 13.8 percent during the vitamin E period 
compared with baseline.89

Page 16Although the research on efficacy is conflicting, 
vitamin E is relatively safe and may be considered for 
adjunctive treatment in epileptic patients, particularly 
children.
Manganese
In rats, manganese deficiency increased sus -
ceptibility to electroshock-induced convulsions. In ad -
dition, hydralazine-induced seizures in rats were pre -
vented by prior administration of manganese.90
In humans with epilepsy, whole-blood man -
ganese levels were significantly lower by 20-41 percent 
than in controls.91-96 Manganese concentrations in epi -
leptic patients did not correlate with seizure frequency 
or the type, dose, or plasma levels of anticonvulsant 
medication. Concentrations of other minerals, such 
as zinc and copper, were generally normal, suggesting 
that the association between manganese deficiency and 
epilepsy was not due to general malnutrition. Patients 
whose epilepsy was a result of trauma had significantly 
higher blood manganese concentrations than patients 
with no history of trauma,92 which suggests that man -
ganese deficiency is a primary contributing factor, rather 
than a consequence, of epilepsy or its treatment.
One group of practitioners stated that unspeci -
fied doses of manganese were helpful in controlling epi -
leptic seizures.97 In a case report, a 12-year-old boy with 
poorly controlled epilepsy and a low blood manganese 
level experienced fewer seizures after treatment with 20 
mg manganese daily. A dose of 10 mg/day was tried ini -
tially for three weeks, but was not effective.91
T aurine
T aurine acts as a modulator of membrane ex -
citability in the central nervous system by inhibiting the 
release of other neurotransmitters and decreasing mito -
chondrial release of calcium.98 T aurine concentrations 
have been found to be elevated in serum, but decreased 
in the brain, of some patients with epilepsy. In contrast, 
serum concentrations of most other amino acids were 
lower in patients with epilepsy than in healthy controls. 
T aurine administration partially corrected these low se -
rum amino acid concentrations.99-102
T aurine has been administered orally or intra -
venously at a wide range of doses (200 mg/day to 21 g/
day) for varying periods of time to patients with severe, intractable epilepsy. In some studies, a significant reduc -
tion in seizure frequency was observed,103-107 whereas no 
benefit was seen in others.108 According to one report, 
taurine was effective against partial epilepsy but had lit -
tle effect on generalized epilepsy. The beneficial effects 
of taurine frequently diminished or disappeared after a 
few weeks of treatment. One possible explanation for 
the loss of efficacy is that high-dose taurine caused ami -
no acid imbalances, as suggested by the appearance of 
generalized aminoaciduria in a patient during treatment 
daily with 2.0-2.5 g taurine. It has been suggested that 
the optimal dose of taurine to treat epilepsy might be in 
the range of 100-500 mg/day, and in one report a loss of 
antiseizure activity was seen in some patients when the 
dose was increased above 1.5 g/day. While additional 
studies are needed to determine taurine’s optimal dos -
age range, no specific dosage regimen has been shown to 
produce long-lasting improvement of epilepsy.
Dimethylglycine
Dimethylglycine, a metabolite of betaine, dem -
onstrated anticonvulsant activity in mice in one study,109 
but not in another.110
In a case report, a 22-year-old mentally handi -
capped man with mixed complex, partial, and grand mal 
seizures had been having 16-18 generalized seizures per 
week, despite therapeutic levels of phenobarbital and 
carbamazepine. His mother began giving him 90 mg 
dimethylglycine twice daily because of a suggestion it 
might improve his stamina. Within one week his seizure 
frequency dropped to three per week. T wo attempts to 
withdraw dimethylglycine resulted in a dramatic in -
crease in seizures.111
In follow-up studies, administration of di -
methylglycine to 24 epileptic patients in doses of 300-
810 mg/day for up to 30 days did not produce any im -
provement.112,113 It was suggested that the one patient 
who benefited from dimethylglycine may have had an 
isolated metabolic defect that was overcome by treat -
ment with this compound.
Thiamine
Severe thiamine deficiency can cause seizures 
in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic patients; these sei -
zures are reversible with thiamine supplementation. Low

Review Article
Page 17thiamine status was found in 25 percent of 620 epilep -
tic patients attending an outpatient clinic in one study, 
and in 31 percent of 72 patients in another study.114,115 
In a placebo-controlled trial, supplementation of epilep -
tic patients with 50 mg thiamine daily for six months 
was associated with significant improvements in tests 
of both verbal and non-verbal IQ.113 Thus, suboptimal 
thiamine status may be a factor in the impaired cogni -
tive function seen in some patients with epilepsy.
Folic Acid
Seizures occur in some infants with cerebral 
folate deficiency, a syndrome that also includes slow 
head growth, psychomotor retardation, cerebellar atax -
ia, and other neurological abnormalities. This syndrome 
is caused by impaired transport of folate across the 
blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system. The 
transport defect can be overcome by administration of 
folinic acid (an active form of folic acid), which bypasses 
the blocked folate transport mechanism. There are sev -
eral case reports in which administration of folinic acid 
(2.5-20 mg twice daily in one study, 0.5-1.0 mg/kg body 
weight per day in another) resulted in improvement or 
complete control of seizures in infants.116,117
In patients with seizures not due to cerebral 
folate deficiency, folic acid supplementation is of little 
or no benefit with respect to seizure control, and may 
even exacerbate seizures in some instances (see below). 
However, folate deficiency is common in patients with 
epilepsy and may have negative effects on other as -
pects of health. Subnormal serum or erythrocyte folate 
concentrations have been observed in 19-88 percent 
of patients with epilepsy in different studies.49,50,118-122 
Low folate levels were found more frequently among 
inpatients than outpatients, and in those with coexist -
ing psychiatric illness than those without psychiatric 
illness. Folate deficiency is due primarily to the use of 
anticonvulsant medications (e.g., phenytoin, valproate, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and primidone), which 
interfere with folic acid absorption.123-125
While correction of folate deficiency is de -
sirable, administration of large doses of folic acid can 
decrease blood levels of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and 
carbamazepine,126-129 potentially interfering with seizure 
control. An increase in seizure frequency has been seen 
in some,130 but not all,131-133 studies in which high-dose folic acid (5 mg three times per day) was given to 
drug-treated epileptic patients. In addition to interfer -
ing with anticonvulsant medication, high-dose folic acid 
itself may be epileptogenic. Intravenous administration 
of 14.4 mg folic acid induced a tonic-clonic seizure in 
one epileptic patient, although other patients expe -
rienced no adverse effects from 75 mg folic acid given 
intravenously.134 One woman with epilepsy had an in -
crease in seizure frequency and severity after receiving 
0.8 mg folic acid per day, which was prescribed because 
she was planning to become pregnant.135 A cause-effect 
relationship in this case is uncertain.
Based on these observations, modest doses of 
folic acid should be used to treat folate deficiency in 
epileptic patients. A study of pregnant epileptic women 
taking anticonvulsant drugs found that a folic acid dose 
of 100-1,000 mcg/day was sufficient to prevent folate 
deficiency and did not impair seizure control.136
Folic acid has also been used to treat phenytoin 
-induced gingival hyperplasia. In a small double-blind 
study, use of a 0.1-percent folic acid mouth rinse for six 
months significantly reduced the severity of this condi -
tion, whereas a placebo was ineffective. Patients used 5 
mL of the mouth rinse twice daily, spitting it out after 
rinsing for two minutes (this solution should not be 
swallowed, as doing so would provide 10 mg/day of 
folic acid). Oral, rather than topical, administration of 
folic acid (3-4 mg/day) produced little or no improve -
ment in phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia.137,138
Biotin
Serum biotin levels were below normal in 74 
percent of 264 epileptic patients on long-term anticon -
vulsant therapy.139 Low biotin levels appear to result 
from an acceleration of biotin catabolism by phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, and phenobarbital.140,141 In addition, 
carbamazepine and primidone may inhibit intestinal 
absorption of biotin.142 Interestingly, dermatitis and 
ataxia, side effects of many anticonvulsants, are also ob -
served in patients with an inborn error of biotin-depen -
dent enzymes. 
There is no evidence that biotin supplementa -
tion interferes with the effect of anticonvulsants. T o the 
contrary, correction of biotin deficiency might reduce 
seizure frequency, as suggested by the fact that biotin-
responsive seizures have occurred in some patients with 
inborn errors of biotin metabolism.143

Epilepsy
Page 18Vitamin D
Patients taking anticonvulsants are at increased 
risk of developing vitamin D deficiency, apparently be -
cause these drugs induce liver enzymes that inactivate 
vitamin D.144,145 Rickets,146 osteomalacia,147 and low 
bone mineral content148 have been reported in drug-
treated epileptic patients. The frequency with which 
these disorders occurred has varied widely in different 
studies, in part because of differences in sun exposure.
In patients with osteomalacia resulting from 
the use of phenytoin and phenobarbital, the amount of 
vitamin D3 needed to achieve positive calcium balance 
was approximately 975 IU/day.149 In patients with low 
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels who were taking phenyt -
oin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbitone, either alone 
or in combination, the amount of vitamin D3 required 
to maintain a normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D con -
centration (15 ng/mL or greater) ranged from 400 to 
4,000 IU/day, with 72 percent of patients requiring 
2,400 IU/day or more.150
Essential Fatty Acids
Five severely mentally handicapped patients 
(ages 12-26 years) with more than 3-4 grand mal sei -
zures per month received a daily supplement provid -
ing 900 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 2.3 g doco -
sahexaenoic acid (DHA), and 50 mg alpha-linolenic 
acid. All five patients experienced a marked reduction 
in both frequency and severity of grand mal seizures.151 
In a double-blind study that included 57 adults (mean 
age, 39 years), supplementation with fish oil (providing 
1 g/day EPA and 0.7 g/day DHA) reduced seizure fre -
quency during the first six weeks of treatment, but the 
beneficial effect was not sustained thereafter.152
In contrast to the possible beneficial effect of 
omega-3 fatty acids, the omega-6 fatty acids in evening 
primrose oil may have deleterious effects in some pa -
tients with epilepsy. There are several case reports in 
which administration of evening primrose oil appeared 
to exacerbate or unmask temporal lobe epilepsy.153-155
Carnitine 
Treatment of children with valproic acid, 
particularly in combination with other anticonvulsant 
drugs, reduced total and free carnitine concentrations 
and increased plasma ammonia concentrations (a  manifestation of carnitine deficiency). Carnitine levels 
in patients taking anticonvulsants other than valproic 
acid were normal.156,157 A consensus statement by a 
panel of pediatric neurologists concluded that L-car -
nitine supplementation is indicated for patients with 
symptomatic valproic acid-associated hyperammone -
mia, multiple risk factors for valproic acid hepatotox -
icity, or renal-associated syndromes; infants and young 
children taking valproic acid; patients with epilepsy 
using the ketogenic diet who have low serum carnitine 
levels; patients receiving dialysis; and premature infants 
receiving total parenteral nutrition. The panel recom -
mended an oral L-carnitine dosage of 100 mg/kg/day, 
to a maximum of 2 g/day. Intravenous L-carnitine was 
recommended for valproic acid-induced hepatotoxicity, 
overdose, and other acute metabolic crises associated 
with carnitine deficiency.41
Vitamin K 
A hemorrhagic diathesis associated with 
low prothrombin levels occurs in about 27 percent of 
infants of mothers receiving anticonvulsant medica -
tion. Fourteen pregnant epileptic women received 20 
mg/day vitamin K1 for two weeks before delivery. No 
hemorrhages occurred in the babies and prothrombin 
times were all normal at birth. The authors of this study 
suggested that vitamin K1 should be given routinely 
to drug-treated epileptic women near the end of preg -
nancy.158
Hormones
Melatonin
In one study, 3 mg melatonin was given each 
night for three months to six children (ages 2-15 years) 
with severe, intractable seizures. The mean seizure fre -
quency decreased from 3.6 per day at baseline to 1.5 
per day during treatment (58% reduction; p<0.05).159 
Melatonin has also been used in doses of 2-10 mg be -
fore bedtime to treat sleep disturbances in children with 
epilepsy. Melatonin treatment was associated with an 
increase in seizure frequency in some patients and a de -
crease in others.160-162
Because melatonin appears to have unpredict -
able effects on seizure frequency, it should be used with 
caution in patients with epilepsy.

Page 1Progesterone 
According to one study, progesterone may be 
beneficial for women who have seizure exacerbations at 
specific times during the menstrual cycle. T wenty-five 
women with cyclic exacerbation of complex partial or 
secondary generalized motor seizures of temporal origin 
received progesterone lozenges (200 mg 3 times per day). 
W omen with perimenstrual exacerbations received treat -
ment on days 23 to 25 of each cycle; women who had 
exacerbations during the entire luteal phase were treat -
ed from days 15 to 25 of each menstrual cycle. In both 
groups of women, progesterone was tapered after day 25 
and discontinued by day 28. Progesterone was well toler -
ated by 23 of the 25 women. T wo women experienced 
asthenia and emotional depression, which resolved with -
in one day of discontinuing treatment. Eighteen women 
(72%) experienced a decline in seizure frequency during 
the three-month treatment period, compared with the 
three months prior to therapy (p<0.01). Among the 23 
women who continued treatment, the average frequen -
cy of complex partial seizures declined by 54 percent 
(p<0.01) and the frequency of secondary generalized 
motor seizures declined by 58 percent (p<0.02).163Conclusion
A number of different dietary modifications, 
nutritional supplements, and hormones may help pre -
vent seizures or improve other aspects of health in pa -
tients with epilepsy. T able 2 summarizes the strength 
of the evidence for potential nutrient and hormone 
interventions. Supplementation with specific nu -
trients should also be considered for the prevention 
and treatment of nutritional deficiencies resulting 
from anticonvulsant drugs. In most cases, nutritional 
therapy is not a substitute for anticonvulsant medica -
tions. However, in selected cases, depending on the 
effectiveness of the interventions, dosage reductions 
or discontinuation of medications may be possible.
Because much of the research on epilepsy 
management with diet, nutrients, and hormones is 
preliminary, there are few clear guidelines on when 
and how to use the various interventions described in 
this article. However, consideration of basic aspects of 
nutrition and metabolism should aid the clinician in 
evaluating this research and making rational clinical 
decisions.

Epilepsy
Page 20For example, hypoglycemia should be consid -
ered a potential triggering factor in patients who develop 
seizures in the late morning or late afternoon or when 
a meal is missed. Food allergy might be a contributing 
factor in epileptic patients who have other manifesta -
tions of possible allergy, such as migraines, asthma, or a 
history of recurrent ear infections in childhood. A trial 
of manganese supplementation would seem appropriate 
for patients with low whole-blood manganese concen -
trations. An empirical trial with vitamin E would seem 
reasonable for many patients with epilepsy, particularly 
children. Supplementation with magnesium (200-600 
mg per day) and modest doses of vitamin B6 (such as 
10 mg per day) for general nutritional support would 
also be reasonable for many patients, in light of evidence 
that a large proportion of the population has subopti -
mal intakes of these nutrients.164,165 Larger doses of vita -
min B6 could be considered for patients whose epilepsy 
is not adequately controlled by other treatments.

Friends, Healthy Productive Life's 
Just Too Short!  
Helplessly witness the slow decline of someone 
you truly love as they become old, frail and ill.  Or 
stand face to face with eternity  with a serious illness .    
Then you will know the naked truth:  Growing old 
can be a ghastly, brutal and frightening experience.  
Debilitating errors creep into our bodies and minds. 
Then poorer quality of life and illness .  We have less 
energy, and life just  isn’t that great anymore .  
Scientists call it entropy  -- a decrease  in order .  I just 
call it disintegration .  If your body is abused  or neglected 
this will happen a lot sooner and the decline will last a lot 
longer . 
When you've lost your youth along with your health -- and the two go together -- there 
go your vigor and joy, your ability to learn, you r cherished memories. And there goes your 
sex life -- at least it's not like it used to be.  Declining health, loss of life's luster, disease, 
forfeiture of freedom, probably pain.  An ol d, fraying appearance, diminished brainpower 
and too often befuddlement and anguish.  The de letion of cherished memories can be subtle 
-- a few go at first, then entire chapters.  "T abula rasa" or a blank slate -- but it can't be 
written on anymore.  
What will your lifetime accumulation of possessions, money, power and prestige 
be worth to you then?   You will have already left behi nd those you love.  By then you've 
lost everything that's re ally important in life. 
If you have yet to experience your first unaccounted ache, a so-called "senior moment" 
(what a disparaging phrase) or brush with illness, just ask some really old folks what they 
think of being really old. You'll hear things  like "Don't care for it much" or "Things don't 
work like they used to", or "I can't get it up anymore", or "I just don't feel as good or as 
happy as I used to".  Or "My knees ache", "I can't remember things lik e I used to", "Did I 
turn off the stove before I left the house?"  or  "I spend all my time at  the doctors", or . . . 
"I've been going to a lot of funerals lately."  
Like Jack Lemmon said in Grumpy Old Men : "He died in his sleep."   Walter Matthau 
replied "In his sleep? . . . lucky bastard." 
So when we reach a point in life where thi ngs start to get really interesting and we're 
beginning to get it figured out, ar e we supposed to just shuffle off, meet our maker, let our 
physical bodies diffuse back into the earth, wa ter and air from which we came -- in other 
words, decline then just die?  
I don't think so.   
That means NO! 
I’m burning my AARP card in protest! 
Aging later is better than sooner -- much later. 
So let's do something about it.  READ ON  . . . 
 
Another day in paradise  
3 And you know what? The same goes for the healt hy, happy part of life th at is not filled 
with joy and fun, and not fille d with love and compassion, or  lived to anything less than 
full potential right now on our home, playground , educational institution, heaven and hell 
we call earth. 
Aging doesn't have to turn out so badly.  You can increase the healthy portion of 
your life, and delay the slow the process of  aging.  You can slow or reverse mental 
decline, immune decline, weakness and frai lty, as well as maintain a more youthful 
appearance and looking better, and other effects of aging. 
The Aging Intervention Foundation provides  education, and conducts advanced 
scientific research to develop new technologies to slow and reverse the underlying causes of 
aging.  The goal is to eventually control the processes of aging, reverse its effects, and 
stay younger longer . . .   
How long?  Envision added years , decades or more of health span added to your life – 
time spent to enjoy doing the things a nd being with the people you love.  But why stop 
there ?  How about MUCH longer life using adva nced scientific methods that are under 
development today in biotech companie s and research labs around the world? 
Most importantly, it's about increasing the quantity and quality of your life now and 
in the future.   
This manual can show you how.  It's about living longer and better.  And it's about 
filling your life with joy, love and compassion.   
You can make profound improvements in yo ur life no matter what your age with the 
system in this manual. 
By all that raving at the start you've proba bly guessed that I don't care for growing old 
at all. Just telling the aging thing like it is.  And if you ha ven't already noticed the aches 
and memory lapses, consider them a little wa ke-up call, and take action to reverse these 
effects now.  
Well, my own approach to life is usually lig hthearted & upbeat, not all woeful as that 
the opening rant may have sounded.  Like you pr obably do, I have a thirst for life and have 
always been fond of a good time.  But by all me ans, don't take it all too seriously and spend 
your time worrying about how short it is.   Whether its 10 years or 10,000, do your best to make it better and longer, but make the most of what you have .   
I love HEALTHY life.   Gimme more. 
Do you feel the same way? This manual offers you vital information and a 
scientifically proven system so you can enjoy a longer and better  life -- and stay younger, 
be happier and live longer . 
Read on . . . for something positive and uplifting  
 
The Vision of How Long and 
Youthful Your Life Can Be  
My goal for you is to be dancing joyfully on 
this beautiful earth to the sweet music of life  for a 
great many years to come .  You'll be enjoying 
your best health ever -- vibrant, perfect health , no 
matter what your chronological age.  Your many 
interesting activities reflect your love of life !  
 
Joy! 
4 With energy soaring , you're leading an excitin g life, doing the things you love -- and 
feeling great all the while. 
Your admiring friends tell you how fit and trim -- and how young you look. Your 
mind remains clear as you solve problems and create new ideas.  You remain highly 
productive in your work, while learning, growing, enjoying new experiences , delighting 
in beautiful things, and having fun! 
You have more time to indulge your senses – to stop and smell the roses along the 
way, to savor your favorite healthy gourmet meal , to listen to the birds singing in the 
distance in the morning, to feel the breeze against your skin throughout the day, and take in 
the blue sky and red sun of a spectacular sunset at dusk with a refreshing beverage in 
hand and a soothing seranade playing in the air.  
You maintain your strength  and toughness , and travel a path of wisdom  and truth . 
And most importantly, your  life is filled with meaning and purpose .  You're living with 
love,  compassion , while helping build a better world -- for years , or decades  of healthy 
time – time spent to enjoy doing the things a nd being with the people you love -- added to 
your lifespan using the methods in this manual.  But why stop there?  How about 120 years 
or so?    And eventually centuries of robust, quality life using advanced scientific 
methods that are under development today in biot ech companies and research labs around 
the world .  
Most importantly, it's about increasing the quantity and quality  of your life now and 
in the future.   
How?  First of all, for now get into and stay in as good condition as possible  using 
the advanced methods in this manual – until  new technologies  to treat  and prevent  
disease are developed, and are comb ined with medical technology to intervene in the 
aging process  -- repairing  and re-engineering  our cells, DNA , proteins  and other 
components of our bodies and reset  the aging clock .   
Your body is immensely complex , and extending our "maximum" lifespan out to the mulit-
centenarian mark will be the greatest challenge ever .   And we're working on it.   We're not just 
sitting around waiting fo r it to happen -- we're making  it happen.   
This grand plan starts with a vision , then a goal, and then a plan  based on the latest, most 
comprehensive and accurate information -- and finally, putting the plan into action .    
And may I suggest to you that with greatly exte nded, quality life comes a responsibility to help 
make our world a better place , free from so much misery ?  
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
By the way -- the following, the material up until th e start of Chapter 2 -- Nutrition is 
very useful and intended to be interesti ng.  But I don't want you to get bogged down and 
not make it to the most important part of  the manual -- your system for staying younger, 
longer.  So if you get tired of reading and wa nt to jump ahead, that's OK and you can come 
back to this part later -- but please read the legal disclaimer on page 55.   And if you 
don't have any background in molecular biology or  chemistry be sure to read at least the 
first pages of Chapter 1 (Background). And no matter what your level of experience, 
definitely read the section on free radicals .  A close study of thos e sections is really 
recommended, and a summary appears at the end of the manual. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
 
5 So far life's been pretty da rn good to me and I hope it's been good to you.  So far it's 
gone by in the blink of an eye. Blink and you' re old, again and you're very old, again and 
it's over.  To paraphrase (OK, to mangle) Di ckens, "Please Sir, may I have some more 
blinks?"   
Well, if you don't start doing something about it now, by the time you get around to it 
they just might be shoveling dirt on you. 
The information in this manual is for people wh o don't want to just fe el or grow old and 
die any time soon -- and for those who want to  reverse the effects of aging if they're 
already feeling them.  It's for people w ho want to remain healthy, happy, productive, 
learning, growing, having new e xperiences, leading an exciting life while helping make the 
world a better place for a very long time.  For years, decades, maybe even centuries. 
Most of us wiser as we grow older. But I'd rather have my wisdom (such as it is) 
preserved in the body of a twenty year old.  I like my present form, thank you very much. 
And sure, sooner or later we all take the big sl eep.  But later is better than sooner -- much 
later.  We're working on the "much later" part.   
So let's fight aging, while greatly improving th e quality of life in the present with the 
scientifically designed and pr ecision, scientifically design ed nutrition, exercise, stress 
reduction, reducing risks, appr opriate amounts of well-desi gned nutritional supplements, 
and other methods you will learn about in this manual.  Because you're looking this over you’re probably a lot like me in that you are willing to do something about it.  
The system beginning in chapter three is fo r those who want to be the olympians of 
health, fitness, & aging interv ention.  This information can he lp you stay younger, healthier 
and happier, for longer.

6 Chapter 1 -- What This Is All About . . . 
 
"Life's Tragedy is that we get ol d too soon and wise too late."  
Benjamin Franklin 
This manual will show you valuable and scientifically proven 
system to stay younger, be happier and live longer . 
There are no magic potions , but I offer you solutions that can 
get the you very best results possible so that you can live a 
youthful, joyous life , for a very long time  -- until advanced 
therapeutics are eventually develo ped to intervene in the aging 
process . 
My goals are:  
1) To offer you methods that are available now to slow the process of aging,  and slow 
or reverse mental decline, immune decline, wea kness and frailty and other functions, as 
well as maintain a more youthful appearance and looking better, and other effects of 
aging . These are methods I have used with exce llent results and are in the information I 
provide.  They include precision, scientif ically designed nutrition, exercise, stress 
reduction, appropriate amounts of well-designe d nutritional supplements, reducing risks, 
among others.  
-- and -- 2)  To develop new therapeutics to intervene in the underlying causes of aging , as 
well as treat the diseases of aging .  We age for many reasons, and some of these therapies 
will be to prevent oxidative stress (or free ra dical damage) with therapeutics that mimic 
caloric restriction, to reverse the glycation of proteins, to repair and prevent DNA breakage 
and inappropriate protei n unfolding, and others. 
The purpose is to live a youthful, joyous life for a very long time --  and build a 
better world . 
I am basically a guy with a vision of how long and truly great life can be -- and a plan 
to make it happen , and I am uniquely qualified to guide you in this endeavor.  
Probably like you, I'm an aging intervention consumer, patient and explorer.  I have 
studied and practiced health, fitness and antiagin g since 1979, and have been at the 
forefront of biotechnology and other medical technologies.   I’m equal parts visionary, 
biological technology sp ecialist, businessper son and lab rat. 
When starting out in aging intervention I was causing myself a lot of damage while 
engaging in an overly aggressive , misguided and naïve program.   I began to feel like an 
experimental lab rat because of all the worthl ess and dangerous products I was taking at the 
time.  All this was under the guidance of an  M.D. who appeared to have excellent 
credentials, but didn't have the in-depth exper tise I now have access to. It took me years of 
perseverance to separate truth from all the hype. People need to know about this, so they 
will NOT repeat my mistakes. 
The precision, scientific ally designed core components of the manual, such as nutrition 
and exercise information, are unique, and have  been adapted from the antiaging system 
developed for me by Lord Lee-Benner, M.D. F.A.C.E. , "The AntiAging Doctor".  Dr. 
Lee-Benner is the foremost authority on clin ical methods to treat and prevent the many 
negative changes that co me with aging.

More About This System and What You Can Get From It 
The information in this manual is based on th e latest and most credible and effective 
scientific advances.  By following this system  you can expect better quality of life that 
comes from better health .  The benefits to expect include  much better health, more joy and 
happiness, greater energy, a cl earer mind with better concen tration and improved problem 
solving abilities, greater depth and richness of  life, a more carefree attitude, and a renewed 
enjoyment and spark of enthusiasm for lif e. Expect a better pe rsonal appearance and 
beauty, higher consciousness w ith a greater understanding of and capacity for spirituality 
and for making contributions to others and to the world.  But be aware that this "higher 
consciousness" may bring up a lot of new questions  about the nature of spirituality, the soul 
and the self.   
If you tend to become a little depressed at time s, expect the emotional lows not to be as 
low.  Trouble sleeping?  You' ll sleep better. Holiday blahs?  Recession slowing down your 
lifestyle?  Life thrown you a curve? You'll take it all more in stride. Also will come a more 
joyous sex life (whoopee!).  And a more keen wit (I amuse the heck out of myself these 
days, anyway, so who cares).  Chronic mala dies may subside as your body makes repairs 
and adjusts naturally. You will find that you have  the ability to work longer, harder and 
smarter in your work, increasing your ability  to make money (or perhaps an increased 
satisfaction with life itself, and a decreased need for the material).   
 
Some Mistakes You Can't Afford to Make  
Some of the most important parts of an aging intervention, antiaging and life 
enhancement system are things you can't buy (and things someone can't SELL you). 
Common mistakes include i nvesting your time and money in things that aren't 
particularly beneficial -- or are downright harmful.  Anothe r mistake is implementing an 
overly aggressive and misguided vitamin, nutritional supplement and hormone regimen 
while ignoring proper nutriti on, exercise, stress reduction, and some other items you can't 
buy.  And still another mistake is going on a pr ogram without proper guidance, and trusting 
an inadequately trained doctor  to provide that guidance. 
When most people think of aging interventi on therapy they think of some youth potion. 
There has always been a lot of misinfor mation, opportunism, exploitation and snake oil 
associated with aging intervention therapies.  Methods of reducing the effects of aging does 
not come in a pill.  There are all kinds of pe ople out there willing to sell you all kinds of 
supplements and treatments. Some of them can be very good for you.  Some of them do nothing.  Some are downright dangerous. 
Youth doesn't come in a bottle. 
Some health, fitness and aging interven tion programs will be good for one person, but 
not another.  And the same program may be good for you at one time, but not another time. 
Some of these treatments, at best, will do ab solutely nothing.  But others will hurt you. And 
by investing your hard-earned dollars and your valuable time in therapies that don't work 
you are not spending your money and your time in things that will.   You need guidance. 
On the flip side, there are an awful lot of  skeptics and cynics with dubious opinions of 
all forms of aging intervention medicine.  Ma ny of these opinions ar e earned because there 
are "anti-aging doctors" out there who don't kno w what they're doing and cause more harm 
than good.  The long-term effects of many ther apies are largely unknown.  It is important 
for anyone on an aggressive aging intervention program to be monitored by a doctor who is 
8 highly experienced in aging intervention medi cine and can detect negative side effects 
before they become serious.  
Many vitamins are cheaply manufactured a nd ineffective.  A nd over-supplementation 
(megadosing) with many different supplements , or using what are the wrong supplements 
for your body, or interactions with over-the -counter supplements and prescription "anti-
aging" drugs with each other or with prescrip tion drugs can carry poten tial side effects and 
be disastrous to your health.   
Vitamins and nutrients can be a valuable pa rt of your aging intervention system.  But 
they must be treated as just one component .  Other components are nutrition, exercise and 
stress reduction, among some others.  
 
Questionable Expertise 
You wouldn't do your own brain surgery, would you?  When I got real ly, really, really 
serious about aging intervention, I began to recognize my own limitations in separating fact 
from fiction in all the litera ture and products, and the contra dictions, in the health and 
aging intervention information out there.  So I attempted to seek the guidance of some 
M.D.s and experts with a lot of experience in  health, fitness and ag ing intervention.  I had 
located and had consultations w ith 8 M.D.s and a PhD from a directory.  They had varying 
degrees of experience, and I le arned at least something useful  from each of them.  One of 
them told me to find some information a nd bring it in and he would look it over and 
possibly write a prescription.  Th is is not the kind of "expert ise" I was looking for, and 
paying for.  And one M.D. had me on the overl y aggressive program that made me ill.   
 
You Can Learn From My HUGE  Mistakes 
For a while when I was first getting starte d I was engaging in a very aggressive, 
misguided and naïve nutritional and hormone supplementation program under the guidance 
of a physician who appeared to be an "expert",  but just didn't know what he was doing.  At 
that time I was swallowing, inhaling, rubbing on and injecting large am ounts of more than 
148 vitamins & nutrients (many separately, many in mixes of about 20 to 30 or so), hormones (testosterone, hGH, DHEA, pregne nolone, melatonin -- both prescription & non-
prescription), and even a prescription drug to bl ock the side effects of the hormones.  Also 
thrown into this mix were precursors to neurotransmitters, prescription “smart drugs” (not necessarily a smart thing to do), compounds to “detoxify” the body and the liver, mostly 
from all the gunk that was being throwing into  it.  And I was using prescription drugs 
obtained from here in the US and from of fshore sources.  These sources kept moving 
around and changing their names because of FDA busts.  
And I was taking all these in large amounts.  Now I know that this regimen was making 
me sick and possibly would have eventually  killed me.  Excessive supplementation and 
combining all this stuff is toxic. Almost certa inly I would have sustained liver damage over 
time.  And toxins surely were damaging my  cells and wedging between or rewriting the 
letters of the DNA causing it to mutate, with th e possibility (actually the likelihood) of the 
developing cancer of the brain, pancreas , testes, prostate, you name it.  
Properly designed nutrition and exercise, appropriate amounts of water, stress 
reduction, spirituality, and other key com ponents were missing from that dangerous 
program.  For example, I was working out with weights for about 2 hours on 3 days a 
week.  "Barbarian" workouts, as  I called them.  I would take testosterone and get revved up 
beforehand and do, for example, about 12 or 15 se ts of intense chest exercises with about 
1/2 minute between sets. I wasn’t getting enough protein to support that strenuous routine.  
9 No wonder I my body didn't develop muscle or  improve definition.  And, vital aerobic 
exercise necessary for cardiovascular health and the health of the entire body was almost 
avoided.  This not only counterproductive to optimal health, but destructive. 
I wanted to feel good.  Much of the time I felt kind of bad.  Once my friend Shannon, a 
yoga instructor with a vivacious attitude and Shirley MacLaine spiritu ality asked "But how 
do you feel?"  Without even thinking I blurte d: "Like shit!" This is verbatim and I really  
didn't mean to put it like that . A part of my brain must have  been screaming to be heard.  
But I was "committed", and carri ed on believing it was the right  thing to do, and believing 
it was under expert guidance.  It was a kind of  determined, wacko, no pain, no gain state of 
mind. 
Medical side effects of this ill-conceived, overly aggressive, misgui ded and naïve effort 
included overwhelming the liver in processing a ll this stuff, often feeling run-down and ill, 
neuropathy (nerve problems, mostly in the extr emities) and gastro-intes tinal irritation with 
frequent indigestion and gas.  Also I had protein deficiency  -- my body was screaming for 
protein, resulting in bad skin  tone from a depleted unde rstructure and washed out 
appearance.  Under the microscope my white blood cells were just not as active as they 
should have been.  My eyes seemed overly se nsitive to bright light.  And, I felt very 
emotional and angry, and had mood swings -- the testosterone I was taking was being 
converted to estrogen -- I had PMS!  There were several medical measurements that I 
should have been paying attention to.  And, I really should have noticed the fact that I just 
didn’t feel well.  I was starting to look bad.  Once my friend LeAnn, an artistic spirit with 
owl-wise perception described me as “fading”.  
One big wake-up call was an increasing sore ness "down below" that was starting to 
interfere with my work life and my love life.  Precise medical term I devised: “sorenütz”. 
Probably a result of referred pain from all the irritants I was disc harging and prostatism 
(non-specific inflammation) from all the horm ones. And after discontinuing the hormones, 
there was hypogonadism (testicular hypertr ophy) for a while.  Thank God I wasn't a 
candidate for Viagra!   
I could have been a poster child for bad anti-aging medicine.      
I must have pretty good tolerance for all this because others have become a lot more ill 
on smaller amounts.  And this was under the di rection of an M.D. who appeared to have 
excellent credentials.  I just didn't have enough experience at the time to evaluate a 
practitioner's experience.  
Human growth hormone is often wrongfully praised of being the ultimate anti-aging 
elixir.  Once another anti-agi ng M.D. with a great overhead pr ojector presentation sold me 
some sublingual hGH spray (cost: $120) -- also  an IGF-1 test (the measure of growth 
hormone effectiveness, cost: $40) which proved the sublingual spray did absolutely nothing 
to raise my IGF-1 level!  But in fairness I must say that he also had me take "Genox" 
oxidative stress test, which showed that the ex treme quantities of antioxidants did not result 
in particularly low measurements of oxidati ve stress. (However, I  am unaware of any 
studies that have been conduc ted to correlate this laborat ory test with any real-life 
benefits). 
But I came back.  The results of my current system are extremely positive and have 
reversed the downward slide of  the regimen described above. 
Now I'm taking an approach that's more m oderate, intelligent a nd based upon in-depth 
experience.  Now I'm getting it right and experiencing the benef its.  You can have the same 
in the system that follows. 
10 I am telling you all this so that you will learn from these 
mistakes.   
If you are presently going down this path, or on some 
other crank program BEWARE! 
The most powerful aging intervention drugs don't come 
from pills -- they are produced by your own body.  Your body is equipped with an ex traordinary and elegant 
pharmacy which is capable of manufacturing drugs and delivering them to the target locations in just the right 
amounts. But it needs to right raw materials and conditions, so we need to not place too much of the burden on the body with stress and toxins.  The methods in the system that follows will help you make that happen.  
 
Moving Forward . . . 
As a result of the system described in this 
manual, my mind is clearer than  ever and I'm usually living with energy and passion.  Life 
just seems more interesting. I ma ke smarter decisions.  I feel lighter.  I treat others better 
and feel a greater sense of social responsibil ity. My values are highe r, and I hardly ever 
make dumb mistakes.  The smell of the tree s and the ocean more (and auto exhaust when 
it's around) is more noticeable. I have beco me better able to gather my thoughts and 
crystallize complex technical concepts, then communicate them more clearly and in greater 
detail. 
On the system described in this manual I ha ve found that I can work  faster and harder 
for longer, often into the ev ening after a busy day, and really get more done (although I 
have also learned the valu e of avoiding this kind of stress and not going at it too 
frequently). I'm thinking "outside the box" more .  I have also become better equipped to 
recognize and seize opportunity when it comes my way. And more opportunity is coming 
my way – in fact, the preparation of this info rmation is the result of having the clarity and 
energy to gather this experience and communi cate it to you is a result of being on this 
system.   
Sure, life still has a few ups and downs -- but  the ups are higher and last longer, and 
the lows are less low and I usually bounce back much more quickly.   
Although I'm downright happier in general, sometimes when I hear a bouncy song or 
view a beautiful natural scene, or architecture or a work of art, I sometimes experience a 
sense of joy that swells up from inside my ch est that I have never experienced in the past. 
(Gee, I can almost feel a rush of endorphens and a squirt of diazepam[the real valium] 
tickling my brain).  And at times I have felt so good that I seemed to be surrounded by an 
ethereal sense of well being.   
One time shortly after starting this system  I was walking down an outdoor stairway 
and looking around at the buildings  and the sky and the grass a nd thinking, “Wow – this is 
my playground!”   Just last week when driv ing to work and looking around at the trees and 
 
But my singing hasn't improved 
 
After 7 ½ months using the 
methods in this manual. 
11 sky, kind of awestruck, the words “Beautiful earth, I love it so.” just poped into my head.  
No kidding!  
Personally, I plan to remain healthy, happy, productive, learning, growing, having new 
experiences, leading an exciting life while he lping make the world a better place for a very 
long time.  How long?  At least a couple of  centuries, and in exceptional health and 
happiness.  Why so long?  I figure it'll probably take me that long to get life right. 
But enough about me.  Do you want to feel this good?  Who wouldn't?  
The reason I'm telling you all this is  so you can have the same.    
So read on . . .     
 
A Healthy Brain is a Happy Brain 
It doesn’t matter if you ha ve a healthy 120 year-old body if you don’t know who or 
where you are. This system is designed to k eep your brain and mind healthy, as well as 
your body.  
Your brain structure and ment al abilities and health are affected by nutrition, exercise, 
nutritional supplements, what you think, and other factors that are within  your control right 
now.  Mood is set by what you eat.  And it has ev en been found that some parts of the brain 
really do grow new cells.   
A neurotransmitter is a chemical that's released from a nerve cell and transmits an 
impulse from the cell to another nerve, musc le, organ, or other tissue.  Their production 
declines with the age. But lots of other de trimental things are going on in the brain as it 
ages that can be slowed or  reversed.  Details later. 
So an important component of this system is to keep your brain and mind healthy, 
happy and nurtured, as well as your body. 
In a later chapter we'll talk about findi ng more happiness and reducing or eliminating 
fear and depression.  Too many people are depre ssed.   Aging intervention done correctly is 
also antidepressing, as well as spiritua lly uplifting.  
 
How This Developed -- and a Little More About Me 
I am basically a guy with a vision of how long and truly great life can be -- and a plan 
to make it happen.  I am uniquely qualified in  this endeavor. I'm an aging intervention 
therapy patient, and the ultimate aging interventi on consumer.  I've been at the forefront of 
biotechnology and other medical technologies, and studied and pr acticed health, fitness and 
aging intervention since 1979.   I have an MB A from USC, and have developed high level 
expertise, and technical and computer skills that complement and add to the efforts of 
research scientists. 
When starting out in aging intervention I was causing myself a lot of damage while 
engaging in an overly aggressive , misguided and naïve program.   I began to feel like an 
experimental lab rat because of all the worthl ess and dangerous products I was taking at the 
time.  All this was under the guidance of an  M.D. who appeared to have excellent 
credentials, but didn't have the in-depth expe rtise I now have access to. You need to know 
about this, so they will NOT repeat my mistakes.  It took me years of perseverance to 
separate truth from all the hype. 
Each month I attend meetings & conferences,  research and review books, journals, web 
sites and articles, talk with experts in th e field of aging intervention, and write on the 
12 subject. I've been active in organizations de voted to the aging inte rvention and have spent 
many thousands of dollars in the developm ent of my personal system and learning. 
It took me years of perseverance to separa te truth from all the hype -- and get the 
lowdown on the useless and dangerous products out  there. I wrote this manual to share the 
information with you. 
You don't have to be a biologist to understa nd the material in this manual.  It was 
written as though I were writing for myself 20 years ago.  The cliche "If I only knew then 
what I know now" rings true.  It is intende d to inform you, and to motivate you to take 
action to achieve great results.   
I have found a lot of articles and texts on va rious biomedical topics, often written by 
doctors and biologists, either l acking in specifics, or a litt le difficult to understand and 
including too much detail.  They sometimes leave out key minor points that would help 
make it understandable and concrete to someone  without a degree in biology.  Conversely, 
some scientific and medical writers lack spec ific technical expertise and are considerable 
off-point in their articles. 
You'll find this manual answers a lot of ques tions and sheds light on many issues that 
are unclear or not fully explained in a lot of the material that is out there.  For example, I 
often wondered what the heck's an "omega-3 fatty acid"?  (this will be described in the 
chapter on nutrition)  Sure, I could find lots of people telling me th at it's really good and 
that I should buy some from them.  But I had to kind of dig to find what it is, why it's 
called that, what it does in the body and why a modest amount from a natural source like 
cold-water fish is better than capsules pe ople are trying to sell me.  And you will find 
information on some other issues, like free radica ls and why they are so bad, as well as  the 
biology of aging and how we're fighting it. 
I have also been active in many areas of medical technology including the biotech 
industry, and am using this knowledge in deve loping new therapeutics to intervene in the 
aging process.  Biomedical skills include bioinformatics and protein informatics (the 
application of computer tec hnology to genomic, proteomic [protein] disciplines), drug 
design (with emphasis in computer-aided drug discovery and development), the analysis 
and reporting of clinical trial informati on, medical devices and management.  This 
background is vital to the aging research, a nd complements the skills of the team of 
molecular biologists, medicinal chemists a nd other professionals I am assembling for 
research and development in the area.  I was on the organizing committee for a landmark conference to companies active in the creation of new aging intervention therapeutics.  My 
background is diverse, my bachelors degree is  in psychology (emphasis in physiological) 
and I have an MBA from the Univ ersity of Southern California. 
 
SuperCentenarians  
"If you want to know how to do somethi ng, find out from someone who has done it" is the 
concept behind the SuperCentenarian Research Pr oject.  It analyzes f actors that have made 
super-centenarians (people who have lived 110 ye ars or more) so long-lived. The Centenarian 
Research Project will focus on genetic, proteo mic and other biological factors in order to 
apply what is learned to devel op new therapeutics to intervene in the aging processes and treat 
the diseases of aging – and further enrich the he alth and lives of super centenarians.  You will 
find some interesting information on centenari ans on the Gerontology Research Group (GRG) 
web site at www.grg.org/calment.html     
I wrote a computer program and handle the proc essing of various tables presenting data on 
centenarians for the GRG which can be found here: 
Chronological Listing Of All Supercentenarians  www.grg.org/Adams/A.HTM   
13 Ranked By Age  www.grg.org/Adams/B.HTM   
Chronological List Of Oldest-Living Persons www.grg.org/Adams/C.HTM   
Progressive List Of Record Holders www.grg.org/Adams/D.HTM  
 
Here's some information and definitions fo r the areas in which I have been active: 
(Aging Intervention/Ant i-aging) Drug defined: 
Substance that has an effect  on the body  (therapeutic -- treat a "disease" condition)  
 
Biotechnology defined (a number of definitions and interpretations): 
1. Biotechnology Industry Association definition: 
bio — the use of biological processes; and  technology — to solve problems or make useful products. 
2. Creation, development, and marketing of a va riety of products through the manipulation, 
on a molecular level, of life forms or utiliz ation of knowledge pertai ning to living systems. 
3. The industrial use of biological techni ques (or living organisms).   Biotechnology 
products include antibiotics, insulin, interf eron, recombinant DNA, and techniques such as 
waste recycling.  Much older forms of biotechnology include breadmaking, cheesemaking 
and brewing wine and beer.  
Bioinformatics/Protein Informatics defined: 
The National Institutes of Health defines bi oinformatics as “research, development, or 
application of computational tools and approaches for expanding the use of biological, 
medical, behavioral or health data, including those to acquire, store, organize, archive, 
analyze, or visualize such data”.  A si mpler definition would be computational and 
informational approaches to biology. Using computational and informational appr oaches to analyze and process genome and 
protein information  to make it available a nd useful -- to answer questions and solve 
problems.   Examples: 
- Molecular modeling 
- Structure -- how is it composed  
- Function -- what does it do 
- Categorization (into families , SCOP, CATH, DALI, etc.) 
- Phylogenetic trees -- graphi cal representation of rela ted genes or proteins  
- Homology modeling and analys is -- analyzes similar structures and functions 
 Genomics:  Study of the structure and function of genes.  
 
Proteomics:  Study the structure and function of proteins.  
 Computational tools allow para llel and simultaneous analysis  of thousands of different 
types of genes and proteins.  
Some of my scientific and commercial interests in aging intervention: 
1) Currently available methods to slow the pro cess of aging, and slow or reverse mental 
decline, immune decline, weakness and frailt y and other functions, as well as maintain 
a more youthful appearance and looking better , and other effects of aging.-- precision, 
scientifically designed nutrition, exercise, stress reduction, reducing risks, appropriate 
amounts of well-designed nutritiona l supplements, among others.  
2) New therapeutics to treat the diseases of aging, or improve on existing drugs. 
14 3) Therapies to slow and revers e the underlying causes of agi ng.  Categories and causes 
include:  
-   Oxidative stress -- therapeutics to  mimic caloric restriction, among others 
-   Protein unfolding -   Heat shock proteins  -   Stimulate the reversal of cholesterol transport  
-   Uncoupling proteins  -   Vascular endot helial function  
-   Reversing the glycation of proteins  -   Telomere shortening  - DNA double strand breakage  
- Stem Cells 
    and many others 
 4) Gene therapy

Why I Wrote This 
I sincerely want to help you and others lead  longer, richer, health ier lives, to exceed 
your present full potential and build a better worl d.  I approached this project with a great 
sense of responsibility.  This manual is likely to be referen ced for a very long time, and a 
source of life-changing information for people who are willing to make a commitment to improvement. It is as comprehensive and effectiv e as possible, and is intended to serve the 
greater good by helping people raise their cons ciousness, thereby bringing more love and 
compassion to the world.  I endeavored to make  this the very best information and system 
available anywhere. 
I felt that immersion in the subject of agi ng intervention would be the best way to arm 
myself with the tools to reach my own rather  ambitious goals. I wanted to share this 
journey with others involved in the cutting-edge  aging intervention therapies, and to have 
the time to spend investigating new ideas and treatments. I plan to perform aging intervention research and be at the right place at the right time.  And I wanted to have a 
little fun. 
No matter how much you already know a bout a subject, you will learn a lot more by 
committing to writing a manual on it.  By practic ing this in all my available time and by 
communicating to others I found a greater commit ment.  I knew that if I were going to be 
urging others to follow some guide lines that that I had better "w alk the talk" myself.  I have 
often been seduced by pastry, and confess once having a weakness for ice cream, cookies, 
cake -- all manner of refined sugar and lard.  But I hardly touch that stuff anymore because 
utilizing nutrition, exercise a nd other methods described late r has stabilized  my insulin 
levels, and the behavior modification & motiv ation methods have gr eatly reduced to the 
fondness for such things.  And I've experienced  how much better life can be without it  
Since starting this project I have just passed by many sugar & saturated fat shops that at 
one time my car would have turned into automatically.   Similarly, I find I'm spreading more love and compassion.

What would you do if you had more prime time?  
Most of us aren't consciously afraid of dyi ng.  Sooner or later we all take the big sleep. 
We'd probably rather our passi ng be later than sooner.  But most of us find extended 
decrepitude unappealing.  To my own way of spiritual thinking, our physical bodies are an 
extension of the earth and death is merging ba ck with the earth, water, air and universe, 
which are beautiful and grand.  
Life can be so damn interesting -- and it's b ecome even more interesting for me since I 
started this system.  There are so many ne w places to see, thin gs to do, intriguing 
experiences to enjoy, people to help, and worldl y as well as spiritual journeys to make.  I 
think I could keep it interesting and worthwhi le for quite a few lifetimes.  And besides, 
things are changing fast and the I'd kind of lik e to stick around to s ee where this world is 
going. 
So what would your own list be like if you had more prime time?  Ahhhh . . . to have 
more time to learn, love, laugh, play, make ne w friends, help others , redesign your life or 
build a new one, get happy, create, relax-really  deeply relax, make the world a better place, 
appreciate the beauty, try someth ing again that you failed at, a dopt a child or a pet, locate 
and get in touch with old friends  or relatives who you haven't ta lked to in years or decades 
or even centuries, nurture your love or fi nd love again, make peace with someone you've 
had a falling out with, commit random acts of kindness, forgive, grow wise, invent, daydream, forge a plan, have an adventure, do it again, blaze a trail, conduct a scientific 
experiment, climb a rock, go surfin', get dow n and boogie, race a car, fly a kite, uncork 
some champagne and celebrate, have some fun, live it up, take it up to the limit, stage a 
comeback, make funny faces, howl at the moon, go ga-ga, star in your own movie, sail 
around the world, plant a tree, l ove a duck, learn about history and apply it to build a better 
future, go on an archaeological dig (wouldn't it be totally cool to walk where people 
walked and see first hand how they lived 10, 20 or 30 thousand years ago? Or imagine 
what it would be like to live like they did? ), get a massage, give a massage, have some 
great sex, bask in the sun (don't forget your SPF45 sunscreen), sample all kinds of exotic 
and healthful foods, do a little dance make a littl e love get down tonight, crack some jokes, 
explore, travel the world, travel in space, conquer the world (but not literally, OK?), amass 
a fortune, get that dream car, build your dream  house, collect toys, go back to school, get 
yourself elected, make your presence known, be a force, strut your stuff, found a charitable 
organization, hobnob with royalty, hang out with  vagabonds, help others, pen a play or a 
poem or a novel, learn to sing or play a musi cal instrument, play in a band, sing to a dog, 
compose a song or a symphony, create some intri gue, take out your microscope and look at 
all the microbes in ditchwater, make a little mischief, charm & seduce, cause a commotion, 
pulsate in the dance of love, stargaze, e xpand your limits, evolve, conceive & design & 
execute & successfully complete a grand plan, find spiritual truth, conn ect with spirit, find 
inner peace, help others, commune  with nature, be with God.  
These are just a few ideas.  The list for someone who loves life and knows how to live 
it is practically endless.  Because it's there.  Because we can.   LIVE! 
This may be a little hard to fathom for thos e who, when talking about living into the 
100’s, get a picture of someone who is doddering , decrepit and infirm. Perhaps forgotten in 
an old age home and being taken care  of. Still living, but less and less.   
But I'm talking about a centenarian with the body and the energy of a 20 year-old.  
High-spirited and maintaining (and imp roving) their keen wit and wisdom. 
16 As for the future: although the medical technologies to turn this rather ambitious multi-
centenarian goal into a reality do not exist -- yet! -- each week there are great advances in 
science, medicine, cellular bi ology and genetics. We just cracked the genome.  Although 
this has been compared to the first moonwalk, I think of it more like the Wright Brothers' 
first flight at Kittyhawk. 
Even seemingly small breakthroughs can make  a big difference when brought together 
with other developments or disciplines.  Soon, hopefully within the next 30, 20 or even 10 
years, we will be at a point where we can ge t in and manipulate and reengineer our DNA to 
reset our biological clocks. Or maybe even re design our own selves.  I imagine Adams with 
wings! 
Although my enthusiasm for all this sometimes overflows, be assured that any 
suggested course of action is based upon the best  of available scientific information from 
the most credible sources.  Can we make it?  Well . . . I'm betting my piggybank on it. 
Resetting the aging clock and returning to a youthful physical and mental condition has 
been dreamed of since we first became awar e of our own mortality.  Soon it will be a 
possibility.  The plan for now is to get th e most out of life and remain healthy, happy, 
productive, learning, growing, ha ving new experiences, lead ing an exciting life while 
helping make the world a better place while some exciting breakthroughs unfold.  
Now, there are people out there who are obsessed with "immortality" -- but at the 
expense of present happiness.  Personally, I don't think that if you can't be happy in the 
present you never will be.  And things can happen to change your life very quickly. 
You could call this a "Bridge Plan".  For example, rebuilding th e interstitial, or 
supporting tissues between cells that are lost  over time, or rebuilding the long dendrites 
(the long parts of brain and ne rve cells) that stretch long di stances in the brain from the 
hippocampus to the substantia nigra in the deep portion of the brain are lost in Parkinson's 
disease, are sure to be an even more daunti ng task than keeping the tissues we have from 
declining. 
This system covers a range of methods to he lp you soften what Shakespeare called the 
"thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to".   So for now, we deal with all this the old 
fashioned way -- with the scientifically design ed and precision nutriti on and exercise, stress 
reduction, appropriate amounts of well-des igned nutritional supplements, and other 
conventional methods you will find in this manual. 
And besides, wouldn't you love the ch allenge?  Conceiving, designing, and the 
execution and successful completion of a grand plan are among my favorite things.  What 
could be more grand? Care to join me?  I' m planning a big bash in 2100 and you're invited.  
Whether your personal goals are as ambitious as mine, or wh ether you just want to stay 
healthy, joyful and alert until your 70’s, 80’s or 100’s, this system will be of great value to 
you.  The cornerstones are intelligently and sc ientifically designed conventional methods, 
applied with common sense.  Hormone replacem ent and other therapies may be added after 
you take care of the basics with the scie ntifically designed an d precision nutrition and 
exercise, stress reduction, appropriate amounts of well-designed nutritional supplements, and other methods you will find in this manual.  
 
17 Hold on a Minute -- There Must be More to "Why"? 
Ok, a lot of the ideas in the "Why" section above seem like an awfully self indulgent 
and even silly ways to spend your youthful and joyous living for years, decades, maybe 
even centuries.  And that's not necessarily bad, but how about helping others and reducing 
some of the misery in the world?  
As my best pal, Al, a gregarious public se rvant who's loved by the ladies says: "Old too 
soon, smart too late".  As we spend more time here on earth, we learn how to better treat 
our fellows, our fellow creatures, even the earth itself.  We evolve.  But brings to mind the 
phrases "Older and wiser" and "By the time you get it figured out they're shoveling dirt on 
you."    
This material is intended for seekers of wisdom and truth -- and those who wish to 
bring more love and compassion to the world -- and take action to reduce suffering.  This 
does mean being unconcerned with trivial abuses and insults th at those who have not been 
fortunate to have traveled as far down the pa th as we -- although it does not mean allowing 
ourselves to be taken advantag e of or physically harmed.   If given enough time, and the 
clarity of thought, we'll find the light and unlock even more mysteries of this world.  Lots 
of geniuses, as well as us mere mortals, ju st begin to make our stride by 50, 60 or 70+. 
With time comes wisdom and compassion.  An d with this a greater  ability, and greater 
willingness and means, to make meaningful c ontributions and help others -- as well as 
learn how to treat othe rs who we meet along the way.  W ith the wisdom that comes with 
time, we learn to set aside our own anger,  prejudices, personal indulgences, trifling 
concerns -- and we learn to replace these w ith kindness, compassion, love, and more peace 
in the world.  This can come the form of volunteerism, or everyday occurrences.   
This system focuses on optimizing your mental and physical self and is not a spiritual 
program, per se.  But with your body, brain a nd mental "machinery" in optimal working 
order, it follows that you will be more sp iritually aware and feel more spiritually 
connected.  You will have higher conscious ness and a greater understanding of, and 
capacity for, spirituality and for making c ontributions to others and to the world. 
In the future we will face new challenges, like pollution and global warming, 
worldwide poverty, human rights, child abus e, inequality, hate, animal welfare, 
encroachment on the forests, the dramatic increa se in the loss of animal species, and world 
peace with freedom from tyrants and bullies.  This just names a few of our challenges.  
We will need our most experienced minds, as well as those with new and innovative 
ideas to solve them. 
Seniors make good use of their time -- volunt eerism is alive and well in the senior 
sector.  According to a recent survey describe d on the web with of "Independent Sector", a 
coalition of nonprofit orga nizations, foundations a nd corporations at  
http://www.independentsector.org/programs/r esearch/senior_volunteers_in_america.html , almost 
44 percent of all people 55 and over volunteer at least once a ye ar; over 36 percent reported 
that they had volunteered with in the past month. These olde r volunteers give on average 
4.4 hours per week to the causes they support. The 26.4 million senior volunteers gave approximately 5.6 billion hours of their time— a value of $77.2 billion to nonprofit 
organizations and other ca uses in this country. 
One special example is 100-year-old Mary  McAnena, who founded "Mary's Kitchen" 
in Orange, CA.   On a typical morning, Mary is up at 4 a.m., off to church at 8 a.m., and is 
feeding and helping the homeless by 1 p.m.   
18 Over time even hardened criminals become mo re sensitive.  The FBI recently reported 
that serious crimes reported to police went dow n for an eighth straight year in 1999.  The 7 
percent drop extended the longe st-running crime declin e on record and pushed the murder 
rate to a 33-year low.  I happen believe that a lot of this has to do with the maturing of 
America, bringing economic prosperity as we le arn to better provide for oneself as well as 
having the means and greater desire to treat  others well.  This comes with time and 
experience.  
Ethical considerations are interwoven are an intrinsic part of aging intervention 
medicine.  There are some very hard issues, in cluding stem cell therapies, alternatives to 
animal research, social and environmental consequences of grea tly increased lifespan, 
access to medical care, human research, genetical ly engineered foods, benefits of an older 
and wiser population, and many more. 
Here in the U.S., many of us lead pretty charmed lives, many of us with unique 
problems like whether to have a Caramel Waccach ino or a Tutti Fruiti Caffé Grande Ole at 
$3.50 a cup, how we will afford the lease pa yments on that BMW and whether to do 
Europe or just Hawaii on our vacation. Seen the Louvre, seen the waves.  And in this age 
of instant gratification, if we wa nt something we want it right now. 
Lots of folks in this big world don't have those options.  Daily concerns for millions of 
people on this earth are famine, disease and war.   For all of us, with more time may come a 
better realization of th e misery on this planet and that it might be a good idea to help other 
folks  (and don't forget the animals) who might  need it. Maybe we should think more of our 
earth itself as something to help heal.  Our physical bodies are basically water, dirt and 
wind from this earth walking around -- powered by  fire.  So we are the earth, in a real 
physical sense. 
Some people have concern that anti-aging medi cine is God's territor y, and that the same 
is true for genetic engineer ing, biotechnology, and other advan ced medical interventions.  
There are those who once felt that way about im munization. Consider a ll this if you object 
to really long and robust life for religious reasons. 
I have considered the question of whether we are intruding on God's domain a lot.  And 
I certainly don't want to influence anyone else to do anything that's against God's will.  So 
are we supposed to just grow old and pop off at some particular age? 
Dr. Francis Collins is head of the govern ment's Human Genome Project and a devout 
Christian.  He has said that some people be lieve that an understanding of the genome is 
intruding on God's space.  But the notion that we  are here to heal, a nd to try to alleviate 
suffering, is a very strong mandate for the Chri stian believer.  Christ spent a lot of time on 
earth healing and Dr. Collins believes he wanted us to notice that.  Understanding the genome provides a lot of power to do that.  
He reminds us that Christ said (for the beli ever) "greater works th an I do, you shall do".  
Many believers except this as prophecy and in struction. If medical technology provides the 
power to heal and grow wise to a gr eater extent, then we should use it.  
Many of the major religions of the world describe God's wish for us to have a century 
or more on earth. For example, Genesis 6:3 sa ys that our time will be 120 years, and early 
Hindu texts to the normal lifespan as a cen tury with many writings devoted to life 
extension.  Religious leader s and texts view seeking good health and healing as an 
obligation, and speaks of the wisdom a nd understanding of the aged (Job 12:12).  
19 We can optimize and fine-tune the body, brain. mind and spirit so that we have clarity 
of thought and sense of purpose -- and hopefully the right spiritual channels will open, and 
the appropriate course for th e individual will unfold.   
Growing old naturally?  What th e heck is that?  Any time we take an antibiotic, have a 
little surgery, or put on our eyeglasses we are in tervening in the aging process.  So who is 
to set the stepping off point? 
Some well respected scientists and ethicist s believe we should only stay around for an 
allotted 115 or so years.  A nd sure, even I have consider ed how it may be a good idea not 
to violate some unknown natural or spiritual law.  But it keep s coming back to the idea of 
having more time to find out what they might be. 
Consider these simple spiritual concepts: 
 To be connected in spirit with  others and with the universe 
 To extend love, understanding, kindness and forg iveness to those we come in contact 
with. 
 To learn and improve from experiences (s ome experiences can be quite difficult). 
 Find your purpose and live for it. 
 Love -- maybe the Beatles had it right and that's all you really need. 
 
About the Changes Ahead . . . 
Get ready for huge technological and social changes that lie ahead.  Life today would 
seem very different to someone living 100 year s ago (or the even 10 years ago).  We should 
start planning now for people here on good planet Earth leading longer lives. Barring 
Armageddon or some other form of total social  and economic meltdown, these are going to 
happen whether we like it or not.  It's our own personal choice whether we would like to 
take advantage in the tremendous life-extendi ng and life-enhancing advances that are soon 
coming, just like it is our choice whether we w ill go to the doctor when we are sick today. 
The important thing is what we do with all those extra years, decades, and even 
centuries.   
 
Some May Object  
There are those who would sa y: "Hey!! After so many years you had your shot -- get 
outta here!  You're taking up too much space!"  So at what age should we depart?  By one 
standard just about everyone pa st the age of puberty today is overstaying their welcome.   
One well known writer on these matters says  that people have lived long enough by age 
65, (and that the NIH budget for cancer research should be reduced).  So is he going to pop 
off when he reaches 65???  But there are a lot of people who have no intention of going 
away any time soon no matter what we do.  
Population in developed countries  is fairly level at this time. Population growth is a 
skyrocketing in many developing companies. Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Indonesia, 
and India in particular.  Actu ally, today there's enough room fo r all of us, and then some.  
National Geographic says that if everyone in th e world were to go to Texas there would be 
1200/sq ft for each of us.  Population in  developed countries has stabilized.  
 
20 The Above Discussion About the Goodness We Can Spread is Just 
Wonderful, But . . .  
We're Living Longer  
In ancient Roman times life expectancy wa s about 25 years.  During the Middle Ages 
in Europe, the average life span was ar ound 40 years.  Around 1900 it was 47 and the life 
span of Americans has continue d to increase to about 76.    
Actually, not much of this is due to medi cal interventions.  Life expectancy is the 
projected average age of death of a population.  It began as a actuarial calculation in the 
mid-nineteenth century when people started to  buy life insurance in large numbers, and a 
way to calculate premiums was needed.  Alt hough life expectancy has risen greatly, this 
calculated number is largely the result of a grea t reduction in infant and child mortality as a 
result of immunization, public sanitation, and the like.  Al so, the number of women who 
die in childbirth has reduced.   
In 1900 the most common causes of death we re influenza, diarrhea, pneumonia and 
tuberculosis.  Because of better public healt h, modern sanitation and medical advancements 
the life span of Americans has c ontinued to increase to about 76.   
Since the 1950s, medical science has been ab le to reduce deaths due to heart disease 
45% and stroke by 60%. In the 1990's the most fr equent causes of death were heart disease, 
cancer and stroke.  We are now living long enough to get cancer, and hypertension is a 
disease of civilization. 
The number of centenarians has increased from the 3700 in 1942 about 61,000 today.  
They are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population.  The Census Bureau projects 
that one and time baby boomers (9 million of the 80 million people for between 1946 and 
1964) will survive to see their early '90s , and that three million will the reach 100. 
Today the average lifespan for an American  female 79.4 years and for a male it's 73.8 
years. The life expectancy of a 65-year-old is about 19 years for females and 15 years for 
males. U.S. Census Bureau demographic data and projections say that  one in eight persons 
(about 12 percent of the U.S. population) is now 65 years of age or older. Currently, the number of people over 65 is 34 million, which exceeds the number of people under 25.  This trend will continue to grow. In 2010, almost 40 million Americans will be older than 65 -- and by 2030, the number will rise to 70 million (one in five Americans).  
 
Unless we stay younger for 
longer and stay healthy, who's going 
to pay for the skyrocketing me dical and nursing costs of th e increasing number of old 
people?  (This was written circa 2002).  We are frequently reminded in our reading and 
through the media, and in our bones, that th ere is great body of pe ople who are growing 
older and are destined to become disabled and dependent -- and expensiv e. This is true not 
only in the U.S., but worldwide. The economic pressure that our health-care systems are 
facing today, in an environment of increased  competition and reduced  health-care dollars 
from government and insurance companies, will only increase.  When they become sick, a 
lot of aging peoples' savings will become exhausted by the costs. There will be an 
 
Source: U.S. Census Bureau 
21 increasing divide between taxpa yers and benefit-consumers,  with younger workers growing 
resentful of carrying the burden of social security, medical pa yments and other costs of too 
many old pensioners.  It is unr easonable to expect that vo lunteerism, church groups, and 
the like will pick up the slac k.  Helping people stay health ier for longer can help solve 
these problems. 
Currently, the U.S. health care bill exceeds 
$1 trillion. Each year, more than $600 billion is spent in the United States on age-related disease, much of which is for pharmaceuticals and drug-intensive therapies for their treatment.  
The Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-
Related Statistics report “Older Americans 2000: Key Indicators of Well-Being,” states that in the U.S., the population age 65 and older is expected to double by 2030.   
In a 1995 study, James Lub itz of the health 
care financing administration calculated that medical expenditures for last two years of life 
average $22,600 for those who died at 70, and just $8,300 for those of make it past 100. 
According to the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging Related Statistics at 
http://www.agingstats.gov/chartbook2000/healthcare.html  
a. In 1996, the average annual expenditure  on health care was $5,864 among persons 
ages 65 to 69, compared with $9,414 among persons ages 75 to 79, and $16,465 among persons age 85 or older.  
b. In 1996, older Americans living in instituti ons incurred $38,906 in annual health care 
expenditures on average, compared with  $6,360 among older persons living in the 
community. Nursing home care accounted for 64 percent of the total expenditures of the 
institutional population.  
c. Between 1992 and 1996 there was a slight increase in average annual health care 
expenditures among older Ameri cans in every age category.  
d. In a given year, health care expenditures tend to be concentrat ed among a relatively 
small group of individuals. In 1996, 1 percent of  Medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older 
incurred 13 percent of the heal th care expenditures in that age group. The top 5 percent of 
enrollees with the highest expenditures incurred 37 percent of all health  care expenditures.  
According to the U.S. Census Bureau (statistic al brief entitled "Sixty-Five Plus in the 
United States"), the elderly support burden in th e year 2025 will be 50% larger than that in 
1998. Some of this will be covered by private in surance, savings (until it runs out), and 
family.  Still, a great burden will be placed on everyone else.  The bottom-line: we'll save a 
lot of money by keeping and older population healthy.  See the refe rences and links in 
Appendix Item 1 for lots of in formation and statistics on this. 
So let's stay healthy and ha ppy, and save a lot of money.

The Level One system described above is  a great improvement over the typical 
American lifestyle.  It makes use of the best available information a nd would result in great 
improvement in health.  But it is a generi c system.  Medical evaluation and disease 
prevention, caloric and essentia l nutrient requirements, exer cise, nutritional supplement and 
other specifics can differ among people.  So th e level would be to get professional guidance 
from an experienced physicia n(s) skilled in aging intervention medicine, as well as 
conventional medicine.  At the very least the practitioner(s) would be experienced in neuro-
endocrinology, with additional training in cardiology, as well as nutrition, exercise 
physiology, and psychological & spiritual concerns.   
Initial consultations would c onsist of a physical examination with comprehensive blood 
analysis, along with discussi on about exactly what you want to achieve, then you would 
receive recommendations as how to best reach them, and othe r items.  A treatment plan 
would be developed and you would be educated  as to your new program.  Your optimal 
program may change over time. 
Many people are disillusioned with doctors.  Although doctors work extremely hard for 
many years, their method is usually to fix thi ngs after they are broke n and not prevention.  
They come from an "ill health" model and are used to looking at people when they are sick.  So that's their only frame of reference. A lot of doctors do not work well along with 
patients to develop disease prevention programs.   
Recently M.D.s are going to weekend seminars on growth hormone and other forms of 
hormone replacement etc.  But after the brief training they do not really understand the 
complexity of the neuro-endocrine system a nd cannot apply it effectively until they have 
had years of experience.  
 
Level Three  
Level Three consists of highly effective treatments for diseases and methods of 
diagnosing disease that you might develop in  the near or distant future.  Medical 
technology is moving at an astounding rate. For example, there's a lot of new research and 
information about how genes predispose us t o, and control the development of, diseases.  
This is beginning to be put  into use right now.   
There have been huge advances in medical t echnology with last few years, and the pace 
is accelerating.  Biotechnology, cl oning, and human genome proj ect come to mind.  In the 
various Email lists to which I subscribe, I see advances on a smaller scale made almost daily. Here are a few of the more recent initial  developments, most of which should lead to 
very significant advances.  These may be old hat by the time you read this. 
 
Here's what the future holds: 
 A greater understanding of diseases and how to combat them on the genetic level.  
Note: There will be a brief discussion of genes and genetics in the Part I.   For 
example, a single gene, p21, is thought to  launch cells on the road to cancer, 
hardening of the arteries, arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. When the gene is turned off, cells stop dividing and age. When the ge ne is switched on, it st arts a protein chain 
reaction that triggers other genes into creating proteins that may cause old-age 
23 diseases. There are other genes involved in  these diseases, but p21 seems to initiate 
the processes. In a just-com pleted study, two collaborating groups of scientists at the 
Wistar Institute have identified the struct ure of a molecule known to regulate gene 
expression.  The molecule, called Esa1, is e ssential for cell growth in yeast and is 
related to a human molecule that has been im plicated in certain kinds of leukemia.   
They compared the structure with that of several molecules with related function (known as histone acetyltransferases, or  HATs) but with different kinds of 
composition -- revealing unanticipated st ructural similarities, suggesting the 
molecules probably share a common mode of  action.   The ability to turn genes on 
and off appropriately is key to normal func tion in all cells, and mutations in the 
regulatory molecules studied have been lin ked to an array of diseases, including 
cancers.  "These molecules help balance th e activation and inactiv ation of genes in 
the cell in a way that appears to be crucial to health," sa ys Ronen Marmorstein, Ph.D., 
senior author on the study and an associat e professor at the Wistar Institute. "When 
they are disrupted, disease states such as  cancer can result. S o, the development of 
drugs to modify their activity, perhaps ba sed on structural insights, could have 
significant medical implications." 
 Curing disease caused by a specific gene   Researchers at Duke University Medical 
Center have shown for the first time that alteration of a specific gene appears to 
contribute to both the common la te-onset form of Parkinson' s disease, and the rarer, 
early-onset form of the disease.  This  finding demonstrates for the first time a 
common genetic basis for the different forms of Parkinson's disease, and they suggest 
that genetic analysis might eventually be a useful diagnostic tool for the disease. 
 Creating custom organisms    by assembling entire DNA genome, letter by letter. 
 Greater understanding of fundamental dise ase processes and how to combat them 
Several laboratories have how determined  how "gram-negative" bacteria, such as 
Salmonella and E. coli, infiltrate host cells  and establish infection. These bacteria 
utilize needle-like projections that appear to serve as syringes in order to inject 
disrupting toxins into the cell and then gain entry.  This knowledge will lead to better 
treatments, particularly for bacteria that  have grown resistant to antibiotics.  
 Greater understanding the genetics of bacteria and viruses  For example, a team of 
scientists at the University of Wisconsin researchers and elsewhere have decoded the 
DNA of the lethal strain of E. coli O157:H7 bacteria. Armed with this information we 
will eventually create a vaccine.   E. coli frequently picks up swatches of genetic 
material from other bacteria and viruses. A harmless version of E. coli lives in the gut 
of humans. The virulent strain shares a bout 3,500 genes with its harmless cousin. But 
the E. coli O157:H7 strain has about 1,300 a dditional genes, while the harmless strain 
has 530 genes not found in O157:H7.   
 Gene chips displaying a visual representation consisting of different colors 
representing whether particular ge nes are activated or are silent.  
 Genetic screening.    It used to be that the same tr eatment or medicine would first to be 
given to everyone stricken with a particular  disease.  Then it would be a matter of 
waiting to see whether it worke d.  If it did work, great!  If it didn't, then the next 
treatment or medicine would be tried.  Different people respond to different 
treatments in different ways. Genetic screening will determine which treatments would be most effective for an  individual genetic makeup.   
 Repairing damaged and aging brains  -- from Alzheimers to Parkinsons to Attention 
Deficit Disorder, and more . 
24  Faster and more effective methods of diagnosing disease are being developed.  For 
example, the agonizing wait to discover whet her a baby has cystic fibrosis is being 
reduced by a small portable detector devel oped by researchers in Ireland which can 
give a result in minutes, rather than the full day needed for a lab test 
 Gene therapy to splice a new gene to the DNA to replace a faulty one.   
 Medications that are personalized your body.   
 Stem cell therapy  This may someday be used to cure currently incurable diseases such 
as diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's and ot hers.  A stem cell is a basic kind cell that 
is  "undifferentiated".  They're kind of like blank cells or templates.  Scientists are 
learning to manipulate stem cells to get th em to divide and differentiate into any 
specialized kind of cell in the body (neurons , blood, muscle, bone, etc.) in order to 
replace diseased or  lost tissue.   
There is a great deal of et hical debate surrounding stem cells, as currently they are 
derived from embryos. Typically these woul d come from embryos developed through 
in vitro fertilization, but where the parents had already had their child or decided not 
to have a child and were destined to be destroyed.  The core of the debate is the 
question as to whether the embryo (a  one-week-old microscopic ball of 
undifferentiated cells originally destined for in-vitro fertilization but are later 
determined not to be used) is a human being, and potential medical benefits for desperately ill children adults  outweigh any ethical reserv ations. According to a poll 
commissioned by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International (JDRF) 
nearly two thirds of Americ ans support federal funding fo r stem cell research from 
excess human embryos developed through in vi tro fertilization and fetal tissue that 
has been donated to research.    
 Adult Stem cell therapy  A new technique which can examine all the chromosomes 
in test-tube embryos could identify those with chromosomes that are 'non-viable' -- 
meaning incomplete, broken or hybrid sets of chromosomes. A la rge percentage  of 
embryos have these defects and would have  no chance of growing if implanted into 
the womb.  But there have been cases wh ere early tests have shown a chromosomal 
abnormality in an embryo, but when the baby is born it doesn't have the abnormality. So it may be possible for the embryos to fix themselves in some cases.
 
 Also, recent evidence that certain cells from  adults may hold much of the curative 
potential previously believed unique to embryo cells.  For example, Advanced Cell 
Technology has had early success in the use of  skin cells in animals.  And French 
researchers recently harvested muscle cells from a 72-year-old patient's thigh, grew 
them in a laboratory for two weeks and then injected them into a portion of the heart 
muscle that was so badly damaged from a hear t attack that it was failing to contract at 
all.  And researchers at UCLA and the University of Pittsburgh have grown bone, 
muscle and cartilage using stem cells harvested from fat.  
 Bone marrow might provide an easy source of new brain cells, offering treatments for 
a range of diseases from stroke to Alzh eimer's.  Recently tw o separate teams of 
scientists from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) 
and Stanford University in California, usi ng different methods and different strains of 
mice, demonstrated that transplanted bone  marrow cells can transform themselves 
naturally into brain cells and install themselves seamlessly into the brain.  
 Proteomic gene chips are counterparts to the much publicized genomic "gene chips", 
reveal the activity of thousands of genes in the human genome project.  Proteomic 
25 chips have been developed that measure the functions of thousands of proteins 
simultaneously. In an article published in the September 8, 2000, issue of the journal 
Science, Howard Hughes Medical Institute i nvestigator Stuart L. Schreiber and Gavin 
MacBeath, both at Harvard University, repor ted that they had successfully developed 
and tested protein microarrays.  In experi ments these chips indicate when proteins 
attach to one another, the interactions  between enzymes and their substrates 
(molecules upon which the enzymes act), and small molecule-prote in interactions. 
Advanced versions of these are under de velopment that will be invaluable in 
distinguishing the proteins of normal cells from early-stage can cer cells, and from 
malignant, metastatic cancer cells. 
 Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis  allows doctors review genes and select a healthy 
embryo to be fertilized and then implan ted in the womb of a mother. Inherited 
diseases such as hemophilia and cystic fi brosis can be screened out before the 
embryos are placed in the womb.  Although ar e tests for diseases like CF, which can 
be done during pregnancy, they will only tell a couple whether the already growing 
fetus has the disease.  If positive, they ar e then faced with the knowledge that their 
child will have the disease and with  the decision of a possible abortion.  
 Nerve growth factor (NGF)  -- In the study funded by the Na tional Institute of Mental 
Health, neuroscientists at the University of Rochester Medical Center genetically 
engineered mice with enhanced ability to learn. The results were published in Human 
Gene Therapy.  The team was able to ma ke the line of mice smarter by boosting the 
amount of the molecule nerve growth f actor (NGF) in their brains. These mice 
learned to run unfamiliar mazes more quick ly than their unmodified counterparts. 
Maybe someday we'll know enough to help prevent people from losing their cognitive abilities prematurely, as we see in  some neurodegenerative diseases -- or 
even enhance cognitive abilities in ourselves. 
 Thought control of medical devices  People who are paralyzed as a result of spinal-
cord injuries or illn esses such as Lou Gehrig's diseas e the ability to use their thoughts 
to command robotic limbs, wheelchai rs, even their own rewired bodies. 
 
 Animal lovers, check this: Have you ever noticed how dogs have such a tough time 
eating and carrying things around?  I'm envi sioning a kind of robotic hand attachment 
so they can chow down on their doggie bisc uits with delicacy and dignity.  Maybe 
even a speech chip so he can just tell you when he wants out.  
 Nanotechnology and nanomedicine  Tiny devices, smaller than a cell, that will move 
around the body and repair DNA thereby pree mpting disease, remove cellular and 
debris and otherwise repair our bodies on a micro level. "Smart pharmacies" will detect chemical signals from body cells, ca lculate the dose and precisely dispense 
drugs, or travel up and down your DNA l ooking for errors, and make repairs.  
Although most of this falls into what I've  labeled "Level III" and "IV", in Nov., 2000 
scientists at Cornell University announced that they have built and pilot-tested the 
first biomolecular motors with tiny metal prope llers the size of virus particles.   These 
prototypes are fueled by ATP, the body's own energy molecule.  
 Retinal and cochlear implant technology.  Cochlear implants detect sounds in the ear 
and transmit them to the brain's auditory ne rve.  Today cochlear implants allow tens 
of thousands of deaf people around the worl d to hear sounds.   Retinal implants, 
which detect light signals and transmit them  to the optic nerve, are currently under 
clinical trials.  They are best suited for people who suffer from diseases like retinitis 
pigmentosa and macular degeneration.  
26  Fiber-optic probes  to immediately detect bacteria like Salmonella and E. Coli in 
foods.   These are now under development by University of Rhode Island researchers.  
A fiber-optic probe can be inse rted into the food at the pro cessing plant to test levels 
of bacteria.  Results are returned in about  an hour.  Currently, food samples must be 
sent to a lab for testing and it take s several days to get the results.  
 Gene Biochips (a sliver of glass or silicon cove red with bits of DNA) -- When a 
specimen of diseased tissue is dropped on a biochip, the device pinpoints the active 
genes.  This is a first critical step towa rd diagnosis and treatment.  It makes the 
distinction between genes that  should be active to keep  cells healthy and detects 
inappropriate gene activity that makes cells sick.  
 Microchip technology to create biomedical nanotechnology treatments. This 
technology will use microscopically small microchips combined with cell 
manipulation, which can then deliver a speci fic amount of drugs to a particular kind 
of cell.  Much of it is still a long way off from commercialization or human 
experiments, but as a basic example, when  former astronaut and U.S. Senator John 
Glenn was catapulted back into space his vi tal signs were monitored through a pill he 
swallowed containing a miniaturi zed radio communications device.  
 Genetic engineering  Today flocks of genetically engineered sheep produce human 
proteins for use in the drug industry and ge netically engineered bacteria and yeast 
routinely provide human proteins such as insulin.  Using techni ques similar to those 
used to produce Dolly the sheep, scientists  at Nexia Biotechnol ogies in Quebec have 
bred goats with spider genes.  They cl aim to be on the verge of producing unlimited 
quantities of spider silk - in goat's milk. Spider silk is compatible with the human 
body, and could be used for strong, tough arti ficial tendons, ligaments and limbs.  
The new material could also be used to  help tissue repair, wound healing and to 
create super-thin, biodegradable sutures for eye or neurosurgery.  
 By the year 2005, scientists may be able to  genetically engineer and replace damaged 
cells in the ears of deaf individuals to help  them hear restore hearing to patients with 
long-term deafness.  The genetically modifi ed cells from the embryonic ear will work 
along with cochlear ear implants. 
  Cloning of endangered and extinct species  Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. (ACT) 
reached an agreement with the Spanish G overnment to clone the extinct bucardo 
mountain goat.  ACT has successfully implanted the cloned cell of an endangered 
Asian guar (a kind of ox) into a cow named Bessie . The goal of the research is to use 
the cross-species cell transf er technology to reprogram human cells for medical 
purposes, said Dr. Michael West, CEO of  ACT. ACT scientists removed the DNA 
from one of Bessie's eggs and fused the egg with a skin cell taken from a living gaur, 
producing a genetically gaur egg that woul d be accepted by Bessie's immune system. 
Before being implanted in Bessie's uterus, the egg was artificially induced to begin 
dividing without being fertilized. The techni que could not be used on long-extinct 
species because the DNA donor cells must co me from a live animal, one that has 
been dead for less than five days, or on e that has been frozen since its death. Bessie 
recently gave  birth to Noah , the guar calf.  Sadly, even though some of the finest 
veterinarians attended Noah, after one month he died of dysentary which could have 
been prevented by a vaccine. 
The list goes on and on, with significant announc ements almost daily.   But with this 
we're not yet repairing or reengineering your DNA to restore you to youthful condition.  
The best part comes next . . . 
27  
Level Four -- The Next Generation 
Medical knowledge has been doubling about ev ery 3.5 years.  That rate is increasing 
due to technologies like the internet and th e recent mapping of the human genome.  We 
have an unprecedented increase in the abil ity to gather, synthesize, and communicate 
information and this is increasing exponentially. 
Level Four is under continued construction and where we really get into pushing out 
our maximum life span, as well as our capabilities.   
Since different parts of the body age for diffe rent reasons, these advances will be made 
on multiple fronts with multiple methods. Method s to treat and preven t disease will team 
with medical technology to intervene in the ag ing process, and allow us to re-engineer our 
DNA and other body components to reset the aging clock and redesign our bodies and 
nervous systems for much greater  durability and intelligence.  
Drugs and genetic engineering will knock out ge nes that cause disease, enable ones that 
prevent it, and splice in othe r genes for added functionalit y. More effective and precise 
antioxidants will be designed. St em cell therapies and cloning body parts (not an entire 
person) will fix worn out organs.  
Nanotechnology and nanomedicine -- tiny biom echanical systems would travel up and 
down our DNA and throughout our bodies and fix them.  
Sure sounds easy, but actually an imme nse and daunting task, and an ultimate 
challenge. But who said it would be easy?  Let's stick around l ong enough to find out. 
Other radical transhuman (transitional hum an) ambitions include things like much 
higher intelligence, person-mach ine interfaces or even mergi ng with machines, traveling 
and living in space, and just about anything else you could imagine. 
Some futurists are predicting the ability to eventually "upload our consciousness" into a 
kind of supercomputer, and live in a virtual reality world with any conceivable kind of 
experience and sensory input delight you woul d imagine or desire.  Faxing and copying 
ourselves has been the topic of science fiction movies la tely. But if we can somehow 
"move your consciousness" into another brain or  into a machine so that the being has the 
same personality and memory, will it still be  you?  I may be an old fuddy-duddy, but like I 
said before, I like my present form thank you very much.  Although some kind electronic 
shell or "force field" or the like for protection from airplane crashes, or to deflect things 
like thugs and refrigerators falli ng out of the sky would be nice. 
How about throwing a love and compassion chip implant into the mix?    
Meet Lord Lee-Benner,  M.D., F.A.C.E.  
I once asked Dr. Lee-Benner why he chose aging 
intervention medicine. "What else  is there?" he replied in 
his characteristic concise and au thoritative style.  At age 
70, he is a walking example of the Lee-Benner Method.  He has great vigor and is still building muscle, while 
putting to shame men half hi s age who are habitually 
fatigued and just building paunch.  
With more than 35 years experience in aging 
medicine Lord Lee-Benner, M.D. F.A.C.E.  is the foremost authority on clinical 
applications to treat and prevent the many negative changes that come with aging.  
 
28 Although he understands the many theories of agi ng, he is primarily a c linician -- he treats 
patients on a one-to-one basis, helping them ha ve longer and better lives.  And while other 
practitioners know about one or  two of the “hows” and “whys” of aging, Dr. Lee-Benner 
applies what is often a complex combination of the medical speci alties that are important in 
aging -- endocrinology, neurology, cardiology, nutrition, exerci se science, psychiatry, 
sexuality, life changing behavior  techniques, spirituality --  and others depending on each 
individual patient's n eeds and interests.  
He was acclaimed "the World’s leading authority in Anti-Aging Medicine" by 
Longevity Magazine, 1989, and again by his peer s at the First Intern ational Meeting of 
Anti-Aging Specialists, Cancun, Mexico, 1994. 
His youth, in his own words, “was a time of perseverance through adversity, and 
learning to be self-reliant.” During his early years, he lived in orphanages and in foster 
homes, working at odd-jobs to support hims elf through school, excelling in scouting, and 
studying with the Jesuits. At the age of 17 he  volunteered to join the U.S. Navy to fly 
torpedo bombers during the Korean War. He se rved in the Navy for over 10 years where he 
completed his high school and college degrees, as well as serving 4 years as an officer-of-
the-line at sea, and as a U.S. Naval Minewa rfare Officer, and again, volunteered to be a 
Military Advisor in Indochin a. While there, he took advantage of the opportunity to 
become familiar with the philosophy and teachings of Buddhism and meditation.   
Initially in his professional  practice, Dr. Lee-Benner wo rked with seniors who were 
bed-ridden.  This gave him an understanding of  the helplessness and fr ustration that comes 
with old age and frailty. It’s that feeling of helplessness th at inspired him to explore 
preventive medicine and dedicate his life to finding preventive causes of diseases that 
accelerate aging. 
Dr. Lee-Benner is uniquely qualified and recognizes how 
aging is a complex issu e involving biochemistry, 
neuroscience, cellular and mo lecular biology, neuro-hormonal 
and neuro-immune interactions, precision nutrition, and high 
performance exercise physiology. Relevant medical specialties include endo crinology, neurology, cardiology, 
immunology, exercise science, ps ychiatry, nutrition, as well as 
general medicine and even spir itual guidance.  It involves 
influences from psychology and life-long personality adaptations, behavioral modifi cation, issues of sexuality, 
stress management, lessons gained in self-mastery, and spiritual concerns.  
Dr. Lee-Benner has been inducted into the 
prestigious Endocrine Society, and has been elected a Fellow in the 
American College of Endocrinology (thi s is what the "F.A.C.E." following 
an "M.D." designates).  He's also a me mber of the American Association of 
Clinical Endocrinologists, the Grow th Hormone Research Society, the 
American Society of Andrology, International Human Growth Hormone Research Society, the International A ssociation of Biomedical Gerontology 
and the American College of Clinical  Gerontology (founding member).  He 
is and a diplomate of the American Board of Psychiatry & Neurology (1976) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (1976).   
Dr. Lee-Benner has written four  medical school text books: Free 
Radials, Immunity and Aging, Phys ician’s Guide to Free Radicals, 
 
 
U.S. Naval Mine Warfare Officer, 
1962 . Flew torpedo bombers in 
Korean War  
29 Immunity and Aging, and Physician’s Guide to Physical Fitness, as well as a book for the 
general lay public, Turning Back the Aging Cloc k.    In 1972, he institu ted the first practice 
of Nutritional Medicine for reversal of hear t disease and diabetes. This was soon followed 
by his endocrinological studies l eading to his use of hGH to treat the changes related to 
aging and the first textbo ok on  anti-aging in 1974. 
Dr. Lee-Benner has gathered his knowledge  base from a wide range of medical 
research and literature, and most important, from experience with hi s patients and his own 
program. He conducts researc h, has numerous publications to his credit, has made 
presentations to prestigious groups of physicia ns, and frequently conduc ts clinical teaching. 
He participates in interna tional educational conference s and workshops that bring 
together the most advanced research and t echnology in the world. These advanced forums 
enable him to remain at the forefront of medical science for the improvement of human 
mental and physical performance.  These in clude the Los Angeles Gerontology Research 
Group, the Fifth International Congress of Inte rnational Association for Cytobiological 
Therapies, the International Symposium on Sex-Steroid Interactions with Growth 
Hormones, American Association of Clin ical Endocrinologist s Annual Meeting and 
Clinical Congress.   
His affiliation with Growth Hormone Research Society is 
especially noteworthy.   At the 2nd International Conference in 
London, England-1996-Plenary Sess ion, Dr. Lee-Benner was a 
guest speaker, and presented his scientific research on 10 years of clinical studies on the effect s of long-term use of Growth 
Hormone in adult humans.  The presentation made a significant contribution to the eventual establishment of 
standard guidelines for adult Growth Hormone deficiency diagnosis and treatment. These guidelines were published in 
the February 1998 issue of the Journal of Clinical 
Endocrinology and Metabolism.
 
His clientele includes high level executives throughout 
North America, Europe, Australi a and South America, as well 
as celebrity clientele from Stage, Screen, Television, and 
Professional Athletes. Other physicians such as plastic surgeons, orthope dists, radiologists, 
and dental surgeons also seek fo r his treatments and supervision. 
His web site at www.theantiagingdoctor.com  is provided for educational purposes and 
condenses some of his in-depth knowledge.  It  would be worth your time to spend about a 
day or more studying the site.  His curriculum v itae is here:

You will find the following information very useful and 
motivating.  When you are armed with accurate information (and 
there's a whole lot of misinformation out there) you will be more motivated to take action to improve your health. 
However, I don't want you to be bogged down with too much 
reading, and do want you to quickly  get into the system starting 
in Part Two.  So if you find that  this is just too much medical 
detail (or heaven forbid - boring) read the part about free 
radicals starting on page 41  and skim the rest so that you get 
the general idea and move on to  the chapter on nutrition, and 
come back to the rest later. 
You will get a multiple positive effect by taking action to 
reduce free radical damage in yo ur body -- so definitely read 
the part on free radicals. 
 
Life is Largely a Matter of Chemistry 
Our bodies, feelings and continued living de pend on an immense amount of chemical 
activity.  Just in case you've never had a chemistry class, he re's a very brief introduction, 
starting with some basics.  
For now we won't need to be concerned with  the subatomic level of neutrinos, quarks, 
or quantum mechanics etc.  Some writers are describing how our mental and spiritual 
existence is a result of matter on this level.   
On the atomic level, matter is basically com posed of particles called protons, neutrons 
and electrons.  Electrons are tiny compared to protons and neutrons. When combined in 
various ways, protons, neutrons and electrons make up an atom. In an atom, one or more 
electrons orbit around a nucleus composed of va rious combinations of protons and neutrons 
(with the exception of  hydrogen, which has just one  proton in its nucleus.   
Hydrogen is the simplest of elements.  A hydrogen atom has just one electron spinning 
around its one-proton nucleus.  Oxygen has eight electrons whi zzing around a nucleus 
comprised of 8 protons and eight neutrons.  
Different kinds of atoms can combine with  one of another to form molecules. A 
molecule is the smallest unit into which a s ubstance can be divided and still retain the 
composition and chemical properties of that substance.  For example, when two hydrogen 
atoms combine with one oxygen atom, the result is  one water molecule.  This is, of course, 
abbreviated H 2O. 
See the appendix, Item 2 for web s ites with information on chemistry. 
When different kinds of mo lecules come in contact with one another, they can 
combine, split apart, or otherwise transform to become other kinds of molecules.  This is called a chemical reaction. A whole lot of ch emical reactions are going on inside your body 
right now -- it’s a part of your  digestion, your muscle contra ction while breathing, even the 
chemical actions in your brain that give rise to thought, and a whole lot more.   
 
31 An enzyme is a molecule manufactured by liv ing tissue that causes a specific chemical 
reaction. One example is a pancreatic enzyme  which causes complex proteins in food to 
break down into simpler structures that can then be absorbed by the intestines.  A 
coenzyme is essential to the action of enzymes, or binds with an apoenzyme to form the 
active enzyme (holoenzyme) to effect a chemic al reaction. Vitamins such as B1, B2 and B6 
are coenzymes.   
Some molecules bind with "recep tors" on cells to cause a par ticular activity in the cell. 
There are receptors for insulin, receptors for low-density lipoproteins (LDL), receptors on 
immune cells that are acti vated by antigens etc.   
An antigen is any substance that stimulat es the formation of an antibody. Antibodies 
are molecules produced in the blood that produc e a specific immunity, or defense attack, to 
a specific germ or virus.   Antigens can be toxins or proteins  or other material that has been 
generated by an invading bacter ia, or the bacteria itself.  
The action of an activating substance on a rece ptor is specific -- kind of like a lock and 
key.  Some molecules, such as some drugs, micronutrients or phytochemicals, can compete 
with a toxin and bind with a receptor, thereby preempting the first toxic molecule. This is called competitive inhibition.   
Others may bind with the activat ing molecule to neutralize, or render it inactive. More 
of how micronutrients and phytoc hemicals protect us from di seases like cancer, and why 
precision, scientifically designed nutrition and other elements of  this system are important, 
will be discussed soon.  
Food Composition 
Have you noticed how some old men have spindly arms?  This muscle loss is a 
reflection of their decreases in organ size an d bone loss -- the loss of protein.  Loss of 
muscle mass and strength (medical term sa rcopenia) leads to impairment of physical 
function, as indicated by the impaired ability to  arise from a chair, climb stairs, generate 
gait speed, and maintain balance. The impairme nt of physical function contributes to loss 
of independence, depression, dependency, and in creased risk of falls and fracture in the 
elderly -- but don't think that if you are not al ready elderly that it doesn't apply to you. 
Along with the general decline in  other functions of the body and brain, it starts relatively 
early in life.  
The prevalence of sarcopenia, depending on th e definition used, varies from 10% to 
30% in men over the age of 60, and women over the age of 30. The principle component of 
the decrease in fat-free mass is in the loss of muscle mass -- there is little change in non-
muscle lean mass.  Between 20 and 80 years of age, the cu mulative decline in skeletal 
muscle mass amounts to 35%-40%. The depletion of muscle mass does not  result in weight 
loss because of the correspondi ng accumulation of body fat. 
The nutrition, exercise, and other components of  this system will help you keep from 
losing your protein and maintain your muscle, organ size and function, bone density, even 
brain function. 
32 Protein in the diet is goo d and we really like it.  Your body utilizes around 250,000 
different kinds of protein, and each serves a specific biological function.   (This is 
distinguished from the amino acids that compose the protein in our diets).  Proteins are involved in virtually every vital process in your body. 
It takes energy (calories) for our 
bodies to metabolize the foods we eat, and it takes a lot more energy to metabolize protein than fats, sugar and carbohydrates. 
In a recent study published in 
the American Journal of Physiology, people who exercised and ate a high-protein diet (a little more than 
one gram per pound of bodyweight per day) burned more fat than people who ate a protein diet near equal to the RDA. The researchers said this was partly due to the increased "thermic" effect, or the increase in metabolism after eating. In the high-protein group, the thermic effect was elevated 42% 
after eating, compared to only 16% in the lowe r protein group. Since th is so-called thermic 
or calorigenic effect of food reaches its ma ximum one hour after a meal, eating six meals a 
day takes advantage of th e increased metabolic rate  that accompanies eating. 
So, we can raise our metabolic rate and b ecome "fat-burning machines." It’s possible 
through exercise, supplements, muscle mass, and frequent small meals.Adequate amounts 
of protein are required for an immense number of your body's functions, as well as 
structure -- and protein turnover allows fo r the removal of oxidated proteins.   
Your brain and nervous system, muscles, he art, blood, skin, lungs, liver, and kidney are 
made largely of protein. Blood contains a lot of it.  Bones are a protein matrix. 
Some categories of proteins  included enzymes, hormones,  antibodies, transporters, 
structural, supporting, and c ontractile proteins.    
You have probably heard about human growth hormone (hGH).  Under expert 
guidance, it can be a useful part of your syst em.  But it is not the "Youth in a Bottle" as 
described by many promoters -- a nd it's definitely not for ev eryone.  More about this in 
later chapters.  
hGH is a protein.  Scientists represent mo lecules in different ways depending on the 
information they need to review.  These pict ures represent different  ways of viewing the 
Human Growth Hormone molecule, a complex st ructure consisting of a chain of 191 amino 
acids. 
Protein functions are diverse, including enzymatic catalysis, receptor signaling, and 
maintenance of the structural integrity of cells. These functions de pend critically on each 
protein folding into its proper 3-di mensional shape, or "conformation".

33 Some examples of proteins   
 Brain and nervous system, muscles, heart,  blood, skin, lungs, liver, and kidney 
are made largely of protein. Blood contains a lot of it.  Bones are a protein matrix. 
 Antibodies:  recognize molecules of invading organisms.  
 Receptors:  part of the cell membrane, they reco gnise other proteins, or chemicals, 
and inform the cell of their presence. 
 Enzymes:  assemble or digest.  
 Neurotransmittors and some hormones:  Trigger the receptors. 
 Channels, and pores:  holes  in the cell membrane (with or without a gate). They 
filter the flow. 
Your immune system’s antibodies that fight off disease are constr ucted of protein, as 
well as the enzymes and many of the hormone s that regulate your body’s biochemical 
activities. Mention the word hormone, and sex hormones like testosterone or estrogen, 
often come to mind. A hormone is a kind of ch emical produced by a gland, that is secreted 
into the bloodstream and controls  the function of dist ant cells or organs. It's a form of long-
distance communicatio n within the body.  
Insulin is a protein hormone that, among other things, regulates the level of glucose in 
your blood.  Glucose is the chie f source of energy for living organisms. Excess glucose is 
converted to glycogen and stored in the liver  and muscles for use as needed.  Beyond that, 
glucose is converted to fat. 
Enzymes are protein molecules that facilita te and direct the thousands of chemical 
reactions that are constantly taking place in  your body.  They are essential for breaking 
down protein, fats, and carbohydrates during digestion, as well as for rebuilding new 
proteins from the raw materials obtained from th e diet.  Each enzyme is highly specific for 
a particular task, and without the appropriate enzyme the reaction canno t take place.  Other 
proteins are designed for the specific assi gnment of transporting nutrients and other 
molecules. Wound healing and water balance de pend upon protein.  So protein's pretty darn 
important.   
Proteins are large and highly complex molecu les consisting of one or more chains of 
amino acids. The 20 amino acids share a common "backbone", or main structure of molecules, but each has a specifi c "side group” consisting of othe r kinds of molecules.  The 
backbone structure of an amino acid consis ts of an amino group (specifically, -NH
2, which 
means one atom of nitrogen combined with  do with hydrogen atoms), a carboxylic acid (-
COOH, which is one carbon, two oxygen and one hydrogen atom) and a central carbon 
atom (designated C-alpha) to which one of 20 different side chains, called the R-group, is 
attached.  The R-groups give the amino acids their physical-chemical characteristics such 
as polarity and charge (acidi c or positive vs. basic (or alkaline) or negative).   
The joining of the amino acids results in the formation of a polypeptide chain which 
then twists and folds into a compact, three-dimensional structure that is a functional protein. The three dimensional structure is held  together by the intera ctions of the amino 
acids at different parts of the chain.  And this  determines the "activity" of the protein, or 
what it does.  The polypeptide chain can then  perform complex chemical interactions 
which are the "work" or benefi cial functions within your body. 
The requirement for protein is  not for "protein" per se, but , rather, the requirement for 
the 20 amino acids that are the building blocks  of human protein. These are, in turn, the 
building blocks of life.   
34 Of the 20 different kinds of amino acids in the human body, eleven of these can be 
synthesized by the body.  However, the other am ino acids cannot be manufactured in the 
body. It is essential that the di et supply them.  This is why they are called "essential amino 
acids".  Even if one essential ami no acid is missing you are in big trouble. 
The body continually breaks down and rec onstructs proteins from your muscles, 
organs, enzymes, etc. in the process of protei n turnover.  It has b een estimated that the 
average 150-pound man breaks down and synthesizes  about 400 grams of protein each day.  
That's about 13 chicken breasts.  
In the event the body runs out of carbohydrat e (glucose) and glycogen, protein can be 
burned for energy.  This is a very inefficient process. And after circ ulating protein has all 
been burned, the body will disassemble and burn your muscle, bone, and organs, which also impairs your immune system and prone  to cause illnesse s related to immune 
deficiency, such as colds, flu, and even cancer.   A very bad thing!  This is why endurance 
events like running marathons are to be avoi ded.  Burning carbohydrates  instead of protein 
is more efficient and is a basis of th is system.  This is protein sparing.  
The molecules of your body such as proteins  can spontaneously mutate into altered 
forms that are twisted or mirror images of th emselves.  These mutants are called isomers, 
and the body cannot use them and they can even  cause damage.  The amino acids that make 
up proteins can also become misshap en or bond together in clumps.   
These damaged proteins accumulate within the cells and interfere with cellular metabolic 
functions. Lack of growth hormone causes th e cells to slow down and stop processing these 
worn or damaged proteins. 
Foods that contain all of the essential amino acids in about the same  proportions needed 
to make body proteins are sometimes referred to  as complete or high- quality proteins.  All 
animal proteins, with the exception of gelatin, fall into this categor y.  Vegetable protein, 
even fish protein, are often called incomplete or lower quality protei ns because they are 
deficient in one or more of the essentials.  However, it is possible to attend the proper 
balance the by combining certain ve getables, such as beans & rice.   
Less protein than recommended in this system is sometimes recommend in other 
programs. The ultimate fact of life is that you are either gaining or  losing protein in your 
body.  And with this system, protein intake is  scientifically coor dinated with weight 
training and other exercise and obtain the optimum  effect to ward off the frailty of aging.  
This is one reason why we have  frequent small meals.   
When we eat proteins, there are chemical reac tions with digestive juices in our stomach 
and intestines result in their breakdown to peptides (a short stretch of amino acids - to be 
further discussed later) or polypeptides (pepti des strung together in a chain which usually 
folds into a compact, stable structure [domain] ), and ultimately to amino acids.  These 
small molecules can now pass through the gut , into the bloodstream and onto the cells 
where they are reassembled into human  proteins under the direction of DNA.

Micronutrients and Phytochemicals 
Micronutrients and phytochemicals are similar in some ways.  The important thing is 
that they are found mostly in vegetables and fruits and they will help keep you healthy.  
They perform a multitude of cellular functi ons, many of which involve the body's process 
and disposal of toxins. 
A micronutrient is defined as a vitamin or mineral that is essential in small amounts and 
that the body cannot manufacture. Each definiti on I've found contains that "small amounts" 
part.  They are either components of enzyme s or act as coenzymes (combine with other 
molecules) in managing chemical reactions.  "So what's a macronutrient?" you might ask.  
The answer is obvious: Any of the nutritional components of th e diet that are required in 
relatively large amounts: protein, carbohydr ate, fat, and the macrominerals.  
Phytochemicals are components of plants that  have antioxidant, im mune boosting and other 
health promoting properties, and there are thousands of them.  
As far as we know, approximately 40 micronutri ents are required in the human diet.  
Some are vitamins, like C, E, B6, and B12, as  well as folate (folic acid), niacin, beta-
carotene, lutein and lycopene, iron and zinc.  There are probab ly others that we don't know 
about.  There are thousands of phytochemicals.  Since so many of these are unidentified, 
nutritional supplements can only provide a sm all fraction of the spectrum needed for 
optimum health. 
A number of studies have shown how mi cronutrients and phytochemicals protect 
against diseases like cancer, a nd their antioxidant effects are well known.  Another factor in 
this protection may be the enhancement of ce llular repair activity for DNA and other large 
molecules. Micronutients and phytochemicals appear to have the capacity to prevent 
damage to DNA, and they can repair damage  to DNA, such as single- and double-strand 
breaks and oxidative lesions.  Mutations also accumulate with age so there's a cascading 
affect to all this damage.  
Deficiencies in micronutrients  result in deformation of key enzymes, and mimic DNA 
damaging radiation.  For example, uracil is  a component of RNA.   RNA transfers 
information from DNA to the protein-forming system of the cell. Folate (folic acid) helps prevent the unwelcome bonding of  uracil onto DNA.  And fola te deficiency results in 
extensive incorporation of uracil (4 million/ cell).  Uracil bonding leads to breaks in the 
DNA.  This is the likely cause of the increa sed cancer risk, and pe rhaps in the cognitive 
defects associated with low folate intake . Both high DNA uracil levels and chromosome 
breaks in humans are reversed by folate ad ministration  Evidence suggests that vitamin 
B12 and B6 deficiencies also cause high uracil and chromosome breaks.   
The phytochemical ellagic acid binds with car cinogens, thereby preventing them from 
damaging DNA and rendering them inactive.  Apigenin and other flavonoids found in 
vegetables block the activity for the molecule ca lled tyrosine kinase. (Tyrosine kinase is the 
enzyme that cancer cells require in order to replicate).  Luteolin blocks the binding of 
estrogens to breast cell receptors, poten tially reducing the possibility of cancer. 
Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption would do a lot to improve public health, 
and this would be accomplished inexpensively. However, this means steamed vegetables.  
36 No juice -- juicing causes free radica l formation from oxygen perturbation of 
polyunsaturates in cell walls of vegetables and all you're really getting is high sugar 
content. 
Take your supplements, but be sure to eat your veggies. We'll see how the best provide 
these it your diet in th e chapter on nutrition 
See the appendix for more information on micronutrients and phytochemicals. 
 
Carbohydrates 
Today there is a lot of talk about “low carb diets”.  Actually, we want “complex” 
carbohydrates” (vegetables, grai ns), but not simple carb diets (sugars, starches). 
Complex carbohydrate foods like vegetables and fruits contain an array of the 
micronutrients discussed earlier.   They have cholesterol-lowering bene fits and the kind of 
fiber found in carbohydrate foods like vegetables provides benefits to the intestine resulting 
in better nutrient absorption. 
When complex carbohydrate f oods are eaten with protein foods, they facilitate the 
uptake, or assimilation, of protein into the cells.   
Although the membrane (outer area) of a ce ll is composed of primarily lipid (fat) 
molecules, every cell's surface contains co mplex carbohydrate and protein structures, like 
the branches of a tree. These are essential to the proper function of  the receptors on the 
cell's surface that serve as a communication network.  Recepto rs on the cell surface receive 
messages then send information back to the nucle us.  This information influences what the 
cell does.  
Michael Pierce of the University of Georgi a and his team have determined how this 
may lead to a greater understand ing and new treatments to prev ent the spread of cancer.   
When a cell becomes cancerous, its carbohydrat e branches change -- and so do the 
messages sent are back to the nucleus. Starti ng with the altered branches, Pierce and his 
team have worked backward to find what causes these changes, and eventually identified the enzyme GnT-V.  This exciting new research draws us to the conclusion that complex carbs are really really important for the prevention of cancer and in health. 
Carbohydrates include a large array of f oods. Carbohydrate foods are converted to 
glucose, and are superbly designed to provide  energy. Glucose is the chief source of energy 
for living organisms, its utilization bei ng controlled by insulin.  Burning carbohydrate 
spares protein for its prime role as a buildi ng block in cell growth and repair. Carbohydrate 
can be stored as glycogen for later use.  
Carbs have the general molecular 
formula CH
2O, meaning they are all 
comprised of various arrangements of the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates They all come from plants, and include such diverse foods as table sugar, apples, broccoli, rice, pasta and honey. 
 
Monosaccharides are the simplest sugars. The three monosaccharides are glucose (or 
"blood sugar" the immediate source of energy for us), galactose (a  sugar in milk and 
yogurt), and fructose (a suga r found in fruits and honey). 
Disaccharides are the two monosacchar ides bound together. Three common 
disaccharides are sucrose (common table sugar)  which is glucose + fructose, lactose (the 

37 major sugar in milk) is glucose + galactose, and maltose (product of starch digestion) is 
glucose + glucose.  Although the process of linking the two monomers (simple molecules) 
is rather complex, the end result in each cas e is the loss of a hydroge n atom (H) from one 
of the monosaccharides and a hydro xyl group (OH) from the other.  
Their bonds are easily broken down by digestio n (thereby getting into your system fast) 
and they taste sweet.  Unlike people in the rest  of the world, most Americans get quite a lot 
of their carbohydrates in this category.  
Complex carbs are molecular chains of many si mple sugars that can be strung together 
by the hundreds or thousands.  The varying stru ctures result in the range of textures, 
flavors, colors and structures.   
Starches and cellulose – These include ri ce, grains and beans.  Both are large 
molecules, and are polymers ("polysaccharides", and built from repeating units, and monomers, much as a chain is built from its links. The monomers of both starch and 
cellulose are the same: units of the sugar glucose.   Most need to be cooked to be digested.  
See the appendix for more information on carbs.  
Fats 
The term "lipid" is a general name for a fat,  oil, wax, or similar substance that, for the 
most part, can't be dissolved in water but can  be dissolved in an organic solvent (like 
cleaning fluid).  They are built from the same  three elements as carbohydrates -- hydrogen, 
carbon, and oxygen (in different prop ortions) plus glycerol.  Gly cerol is a small molecule 
with three alcohol groups.  An alcohol group, in this case, is comprised of a specific 
composition of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. 
The term "fatty acid" is a biochemical descri ption. The terms "fat" and "fatty" are just 
names for molecules of this type.  Each fatty acid molecule has a chai n of carbon atoms, to 
which hydrogen atoms are bound.  In fats, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen is somewhere around 1 to 1. At the very end of the chain there are two oxygen atoms.   
In chemistry there are several definitions of  what comprises an acid, but basically it is 
an acid because of its hydrogen.  But it is much  weaker than battery acid or stomach acid.  
Fats the found in the body are made up of one to three fatty acids, plus glycerol.  
Different kinds of fats are comprised of diffe rent amounts and configurations of these basic 
components.  For example, a triglyceride c ontains three fatty acid s to one glycerol.  
Cholesterol (technically a sterol  [a kind of steroid] and not a fat) has the same chemical 
components as a fat arranged in a series of rings.   
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or "bad" ch olesterol) picks up cholesterol from the 
liver and deposits it on your arteries.  High-density lipoprotein (HDL, or "good" 
cholesterol) picks it o ff the arteries and puts it back in the liver.  This is why it's good 
to have high HDL and low LDL.  Nutrit ion, exercise, age, sex and heredity affect 
these.   Nutrition and exercise are the ones you can do something about. 
A fatty acid is called "satur ated" if all the hydrogen atoms that can possibly bind are 
present -- all the chains of the carbon atoms are taken up.  Saturated fats tend to be sold at 
room temperature.  When hydrogen atoms ar e missing from two adjacent carbon atoms, the 
stable second bond, called a double bond, is formed between these carbon atoms rather 
than between the carbon and hydrogen. Th e fatty acids containing one double bond are 
called monounsaturated, and those with two or more double bonds are called 
polyunsaturated.  
38 Here are some sample chemical structures of several kinds of fats.  The "C" stands for a 
carbon atom, the "H" stands for a hydrogen atom, and an "O" stands for an oxygen atom. Carbon requires two bonds: 
Adding hydrogen atoms to a polyunsaturated fa t is called hydrogenation.   This creates 
a kind of fat that is particul arly harmful called trans fat.  Polyunsaturated fats tend to 
become rancid quickly because of the avai lable spaces on the carbon atom chain are soon 
taken up by oxygen, which causes the oils to be come organic acids which further break 
down to form hydrogen peroxide and even more  dangerous hydroxyl ions -- as well as 
singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals.  All of this acts as bombarding radiation type 
particles that damage molecular structures wi thin the cell, including DNA.   So saturated 
and hydrogenated fats will have less of the tende ncy to go rancid than polyunsaturated and 
monounsaturated fats. 
Most highly saturated fats  interfere with removal of  cholesterol from the blood 
resulting in high cholesterol levels.  Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats lower blood 
cholesterol.  But we have already discu ssed the free radical generating aspect of 
polyunsaturated fats. Excess calories from protein or  carbohydrates are converted to fat for storage in the body.  
A calorie is a unit of energy.  Specifically, 4.184 absolute joules, or the amount of energy it 
takes to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 15 to 16 degrees Celsius. But food 
calories are actually equal to 1,000 calories  (1 food calorie = 1 kilocalorie).  
See the appendix for more information on fats. 
 
Life Expectation and Maximum Life Span 
This plan is designed to in crease your youthfulness and joy, as well as what is known 
as "life expectation", until ways of increasi ng your "maximum life sp an" are developed.  

39 Currently much can be done to slow the rate  of aging, and slow or reverse some of the 
effects of aging.  But right now nothing can be done about the underlying process of aging.   
The distinction between "life expectation" and "maximum lif e span" is important. Dr. 
Leonard Hayflick is a top resear cher and pioneer in the field of gerontology, and along with 
Paul Moorhead, demonstrated that human ce lls can only divide a limited amount of times 
in culture. This is known as "The Hayflick Li mit".  He defines life expectation as "the 
number of years, on average, that someone at a particular age can expect to live."   For a 
child born today in the U.S., that's about 75 years.  
Maximum lifespan  is the theoretical lim it of the span of a person’s life. The 
approximate maximum lifespan for humans is 125 years.  Dr. Hayflick says "There is no 
evidence that the maximum human life span ha s changed from what it was about a hundred 
thousand years ago.  It is still about 115 years. "  He later continues:  "The likelihood that 
you and I will live to be 90 or 100 has certa inly increased, but the maximum human life 
span has not changed.  Life expectation has in creased, but life span ha s not; the distinction 
is critical." 
 
Increasing life expectation -- "squaring the curve": 
Average life span has steadily increased from 25 
during Roman times, to around 40 during the Middle Ages in Europe, to about 47 in the U.S. at the turn of the century (but as described earlier, this is mostly a result of a reduction in infant and child  mortality as a result of 
immunization, public sanita tion, and the like). Today, 
average life span is about 76 years. Future medical breakthroughs will increase life expectancy still further.  
This is "squaring the (Gompe rtz) aging curve". The Gompertz Curve is a mathematical 
function derived to describe expected mortal ity atistics for a population of organisms 
whose probability of death incr eases as a function of time. 
 
Increasing maximum life s pan -- "shifting the curve": 
We want to do what it takes to maintain our present 
level of youthfulness, and even turn back the clock as much as possible, while looking for therapies that will increase the maximum.   
Increasing maximum life span in the near future 
would be called an optimistic expectation by some very 
knowledgeable people (including good Dr. Hayflic k). But recently we've seen tremendous 
medical advances and anticipate the best -- and soon enough for us to enjoy it.  And of 
course, the quality of your life is also very, very important. 
How many years can you add to your life right now with this system?    Unfortunately, 
my guess spans a very wide range. It would vary widely among i ndividuals, and would 
depend on your genetics and what kinds of damage you may have done to your genes and 
to other parts of your body so far.  My gue ss is mostly based on personal experience and 
anecdote, and would be hard to verify with a serious scientific study. I think you might gain 
an increase in life expectation of something be tween several years, to maybe as much as 
10-15 years.  Or even twenty or more if you prevent a potentially fata l disease or nip it in 
the bud with early detection. 
 
Y (vertical) axis is the  % of people in an 
age group still living, X (horizontal) is 
years. 

40 And you would surely improve your quality of life by just about any definition you 
choose.  We're not particularly interested in an empty or hollow increase in life span -- we 
want to prolong active adult life , filled with vigor and energy .  "Compression of Morbidity" 
is the concept of reducing the time and degree of disease and illness near the end of one's 
life. We would want this along with a longer healthy life.  Said another way, successful 
aging means extending healthy life (healthspan) so that the period of ill health at the end of 
life (frailty-span) is very short.  
At this time there is no single overall reliable  biomarker of aging due to the complexity 
of aging and because there is no one de terminant. Ongoing medical evaluation and 
guidance are necessary.  Results of lab tests and how you feel ar e also key guiding factors.  
But for now, it would not exceed your maximum.   And of course, we would keep our 
fingers crossed for you that methods, perhap s involving telomerase, resetting genes, 
clearing out the cellular garbag e, restoring hormone recepto rs to youthful numbers and 
functioning, etc. would soon be developed to push out the maximum  More on these 
exciting developments later in this chapter.  
So What Is Aging? 
We'll talk about the biology of aging which will be in a fair amount of detail. It's good 
to understand what's going on in your body as it ag es as well as its e ffect on your brain and 
mind, and even some things that can affect your  spiritual awareness.  These are subject to 
physical laws of cause and effect, which you can  control to a great ex tent.  However, if 
you've read a lot of "anti-aging" books, with the exception of the section of free radicals, 
you'll probably find some of it a rehashing. 
Definitely read the part on free radicals.  However, I don't want you to be bogged 
down with too much reading, and do want you  to quickly get into the system starting 
in the next chapter.  So if you find that this is just too much medical detail, or that it is 
confusing or esoteric (or heaven forbid - bo ring), just skim it so that you get the 
general idea and go to chapter 3 on Nutritio n and Motivation, and come back to this 
later. 
You will find that the following section on free radicals is covered in some detail, and a 
brief overview of other ways we age after that.  Free radicals are the culprits that are most 
key because they contribute to most of the others -- and fortunately for you, it this one of 
the things you can do the most about.  You w ill get a multiple positive effect by taking 
action to reduce free radical damage in your body.  
Aging is caused by a lot of reasons: geneti cs, the environment, nutrition, stress and 
other lifestyle factors. We of ten hear how "having good genes" is the most important thing 
in aging. Aging can be accelerated or slowed depending on these. For example, Dr. Michael Roizen of the Univers ity of Chicago cites studies on identical twins that show how 
genetic inheritance influences only about 30 perc ent of the rate and ways in which you age. 
The rest is under your control  
Different parts of the body age at different  rates and for different reasons. Aging is 
highly variable between people.  Have you neve r been to a family or high school reunion 
and noticed how some of your relatives or friends seemed old before their time, while 
others stayed "Dick Clark young", while remaini ng vital and excited a bout life?  Think of 
someone who was young when you first met and you hadn't seen in a while, then when you met up with them they looked old.  It happens fast, doesn't it? 
41 As you age, there are thousands of changes occurring on a gross body level, in all of 
your tissues and organs, as well as in your individual cells. It would be great if we could 
find just one of the cause for agi ng and fix it, but there are many.  
The body is constantly renewing itself.  With  a turnover of about six billion cells each 
day, each year around the 90 percent of the atom s in your body are replaced.  We grow a 
new skin each month, a new stomach lining ev ery five days, a new skeleton every three 
months, and replenish out red bl ood cells about every 120 days.  
As your body ages, your organs gradually lose their total number of cells and some of 
the function of the remaining number of cells.  We lose about one percent of the total 
number of cells each year.  Without this system  we have lost about 14% of the cells in our 
bodies by age 45, by age 65 its 28%, and downhill after that.   
Most people lose about .01-.02 inches of thei r height each year, and are shorter in old 
age than when they were young due to bone lo ss and compression of th eir vertebrae. You'll 
lose brain form and function as you age, a nd about 73,000,000 brain cells next year.  Even 
your earlobes will be affected, with the force of gravity sl owly stretching them downward 
almost 1/100 of an inch this coming year. 
Cells in all the tissues and or gans of the body also change over time, which affects their 
function.  Cells slowly lose the ability to  divide and reproduce as easily.  You lose 
supporting cells that hold you t ogether and nourish other cells. Fat and debris get deposited 
into cells, tissues, a and organs which contri butes to a loss of function. Tissues such as 
bone, muscle and skin become much less elastic. Initially, organs such as the kidneys, liver, 
heart, and brain have more cells than nece ssary to function well.  But when enough cells 
are lost, function declines and becomes noticeable.  And as time marches on, the body is less able to clear medicines and toxins, largel y due to decline in liver and kidney function. 
So drugs stay in the body longer and cause more side effects.  And we are less able to store 
and utilize food. 
Without intervention we become weaker ove r time.   Body weight  increases.  But 
unfortunately, muscle and orga ns are decreasing at the rate  of about six pounds each 
decade, while the fat is increasing.  Cartil age is added to the nose and ears, body fluid 
decreases, and we develop dryness and wrinkl es.  Thirst decreases, and sweat glands 
decrease or lose their function, so we are less able to control our temperature.  All of the 
senses diminish and it's hard er to get a good nights sleep. 
And of course, deterioration in the brain ha s enormous consequences.  Like the other 
organs, the brain shrinks with ag e.  And unfortunately, the part s that are taking the worst of 
it are the ones we rely upon most for our ab ilities to reason, remember, and control our 
bodies.  Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released from a ne rve cell which thereby 
transmits an impulse to another nerve, a muscle, organ, or other tissue.  Major 
neurotransmitters are acetylcholene, dopamine  and serotonin. Neurotransmitter production 
declines with age. The potential for Alzheimer' s, Parkinson's, dementia and other brain and 
mind diseases increases dramatically. 
 
Free Radicals 
Free radical damage is probably the most si gnificant reason we age.  Free radicals 
result largely from our diets.  They in turn cau se the release lots more  free radicals,  setting 
off a cascade of events in your body as we ll as causing other kinds of aging.  
This subject comes first and is covered in more detail that the others because you 
can do much to prevent, or even reverse  
42 free radical damage and aging. 
See the appendix for more information on free radicals. 
So what are free radicals?   Normal molecules have an even number of electrons.  
Their electrical energies cancel each other out and they are therefore in equilibrium.  A 
"free radical" is any molecule that posse sses an unpaired elec tron. This unbalanced 
electrical energy makes it attach to normal mol ecules and react with them in highly volatile 
and destructive ways -- it will attempt to "ste al" an electron from the other molecule in an 
attempt to gain equilibrium.  So now the mol ecule that has lost an electron is now a free 
radical.   All this wreaks havoc in your body as molecules that ar e vital to your body are 
both damaged and now free radicals themselves.  
Free radical damage may be involved in most diseases -- from cardiovascular disease, 
to hypertension, diabetes, cancer, cataracts, emphysema and other pulmonary diseases, 
arthritis, immune system co mpromise, Alzheimer's, and th e list goes on.  Free-radical 
damage occurs throughout our lives and is  cumulative -- but budgete d can be reversed. 
This damage is a kind of oxidation, which is the process of adding oxygen to a substance -- 
also known as rust.  It can  be slowed and reversed. 
The irony is that free-radical activity in the body is not all bad.  In fact, it is necessary 
in some forms.  Free radical activity, sometime s referred to as "biochemical electricity", 
helps produce energy, maintain immunity, tr ansmit nerve impulses,  synthesize hormones 
and contract muscles.  Your  immune system even turns free radicals against invading 
bacteria, viruses and cancer cells. For these reasons, too many antioxidants can be counterproductive to your good health. 
According to Bruce Ames, Ph.D., of the Univer sity of California, Berkeley, these free 
radicals prevent immediate death from infec tion. In addition, with th e help of other free 
radicals, the liver's cytochrome P-450 en zymes detoxify harmful chemicals, again, 
protecting us from a quick death. 
The scale of this activity is great.   Dr. Ames has estimated that each cell in the body 
suffers 10,000 free radical "hits" each day. The body's own antioxidants, such as 
superoxide dismutase and glut athione, form the foundation of an exquisit defense against 
free radicals. But the defense isn't perfect, which is why free radical damage-oxidation-
accumulates.  
Because forms of oxygen itself are free radica ls, our very breathing and our otherwise 
healthy aerobic exercise generate  free radicals that help along the aging process.  They are 
constantly created in the body and are a necessa ry part of normal metabolism.  The release 
of high-energy "phosphate bonds" from the uni versal energy storage molecule, ATP, 
requires free radical reactions.  But during this process, small amounts of free radical 
intermediates leak out or are converted to other more  reactive forms like hydrogen 
peroxide, superoxide, singlet  oxygen and hydroxyl radicals.  Collectively, these are known 
as "oxygen radicals".  Fortuna tely, the benefits of exerci se, and breathing, outweigh the 
losses.  It's kind of like driving in a car to see your physician.  The solu tion -- drive safely.  
But in their uncontrolled and dangerous fo rm, free radicals attack your body. Free 
radical damage attacks DNA and RNA synthesis, interferes with the synthesis of protein 
and attacks your protein, a nd lowers your energy levels.  They prevent the body from 
building muscle mass and destroy cellular enzymes, which are needed for vital chemical processes. They create harmful metabolic waste products.  These waste products include 
substances known as lipofuscins.  On the skin, lipofuscins and related ce roid can be seen as 
a darkened areas ("aging spot s" or "liver spots").   More about this gunk later. 
43 Your genes, cellular membranes, immune  system T cells and mitochondria are 
particularly vulnerable to free radical da mage.  Free radical damaged chemicals are 
themselves highly reactive, so free radi cals produce a cascad e of damage.   
 
You can turn this into good news --  
Reducing free radicals produces a multiple positive effect. 
 Free radicals cause a cascade of events when they attach to  the polyunsaturated fats of 
the cellular lipid membrane.  These damaged fa ts easily become peroxidized (rancid) and 
break down to form more free radicals. Age associated changes in enzymes, proteins, 
nucleotides, DNA, and cell membranes may all be  attributed to reac tion initiated by these 
lipid peroxides.   
So the peroxidized fats become mutagens , carcinogens, atherogens (causing fatty 
deposits, or plaques, in the wa lls of arteries causing them to  harden [arteriosclerosis]), 
thrombogens (forming blood clots), and immune suppressants.  
The kinds of foods that contai n lipid peroxides and other foods  that contain a lot of free 
radicals will be discussed in future chapters. 
 
More Examples of How Free Radicals Cause Disease  
Free-radical activity may be involved in the nature of most diseases.  For example, 
there are two stages in the car cinogenic process, initiation an d promotion.  There is strong 
supporting evidence that free radical reactions  serve as a continuous source of cancer 
initiation and promotion.   
Enzymes are substances manufactured by ti ssue that stimulates specific chemical 
changes, such as pancreatic enzymes whic h cause complex food proteins to break down 
into simpler structures that can be then absorb ed by the intestines.  There are enzymes that 
repair DNA.  These, too, beco me damaged by free radicals.  
The chemically reactive free radicals damage joint membranes, protein in cartilage, and 
cells that lubricante joints.  This results in the pain, swelling, and limitation of the ability to 
move, or arthritis.   
Red blood cells and serum (t he part of whole blood which remains after blood has 
clotted and is yellowish in color) are damaged as a result of the r upture of the cellular 
membranes, and narrowing or closing of sm all arteries and capillaries due to toxic 
peroxidation of serum and the formation of vessel wall irritants and suppression of the 
synthesis of natural anti-clot hormone. 
Like I mentioned earlier -- if you find that this is just too much, just  skim it so  that you 
get the general idea and go to Part Tw o, and come back to this later. 
 
Free Radicals and Your Immune System 
Surface receptors on your immune cells are resp onsible for sensing the debris released 
by cells that are invading the body, following th e trail to the invade r, then engulfing the 
invading cell and killing it. This debris is called an antigen (any substance that stimulates 
the formation of an antibody).  An antibody prod uces a specific immunity to a specific 
germ or virus.  Free radials created by lipid  peroxides damage the surface receptors and 
reduce their number of receptors . Free radicals also reduce the affinity for this debris, and 
the mobility of the cell. Free radicals also da mage other components of immune cells.  This 
44 is a partial explanation why free ra dicals reduce immune function.     
The thymus gland is responsible for progr amming the immunoregul atory response of T 
cells (a kind of immune cell that normally a ttacks bacteria, viruses and cancer cells).  Free 
radicals most likely attack the thymus gland.  No longer under the thymus gland's 
regulation, the free radicals th at the T cells norm ally use to destroy invading cells now 
attack the body -- autoimmune di sease.  So this is one of  the examples of how the body 
normally uses free radicals to its benefit.  Bu t free radical damage to another controlling 
organ results not only in the inab ility to use free radicals prop erly, but in even more free 
radical damage.   
And much of this damage wa s most likely brought on  
by the person's eating habits. 
 
Free Radicals and Your Brain 
OK, two psychiatrists passed each other in the hall.  One says "Good morning."  The 
other one gets to the end of th e hall and says to himself "I wonder what he meant by that?"  
Ha!  He probably had lipofusci n and ceroid ("age" or "liver" spots), formed through cross-
linking oxidized unsaturated fats  and proteins and seriously di srupting cell function in the 
brain and elsewhere in the body.   
The cell membrane is the outside layer of th e cell. A cross-link is an undesirable bond 
that is formed between biological molecules in your body. An ion is an atom that has a 
positive or negative electrical charge.  And a neuron is a brain or nerve cell. 
Cell membranes, particularly brain ce ll membranes, are largely made up of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids. This damage, in tu rn, results in the rel ease of large quantities 
of a particular kind of free radical, hydroxyl i ons. These ions appear to disrupt neuronal 
activity in the brain, resulting in the deposit of a protein substance called amyloid. Brain 
cells that are particularly damaged by this cascade include deep white-matter (associated 
with dementia, a loss of mental function a nd coordination) and changes in the cortex 
(associated with Alzheimer's).   
Glial cells surround neurons, and both protect  and nourish them.  A neural synapse is 
the juncture of two neurons, and neurotransmitters are released from one neuron to another.  Both glial cells and the areas around neuronal sy napses (the area where one nerve ends and 
another begins. Impulses pass over the synaps e from one nerve to another) are also 
composed largely of polyunsaturated fats, ther efore subject to the cascade of free radical 
damage described above.  Here in the brain, as  in elsewhere, fibrosis (replacement of the 
normal components of a structure by fibrous tissue)  in the capillaries deve lops as a result.   
Disruption to lipid cellular membranes resu lts in the development of sensory and 
cognitive deficits in old age. 
Autooxidation of L-Dopa damages dopaminergic brain cells (brain cells that utilize the 
neurotransmitter dopamine), and likely pl ays a major role in Parkinson's.   
The end results of free radical activity in the brain are a decrease in the ability to sense 
the world around you, a permanent decrease in the ability to think, and other kinds of 
mental decline. 
 
Free Radicals and Your Skin 
Free radicals attack the collagen and elas tin, which keep our skin flexible, smooth, 
moist and elastic. Lipofuscin and ceroid appear as "age" or "liver" spots on the skin. So you 
end up looking old, along with being old. 
45  
Free Radical Repair and Antioxidants 
All air-breathing organisms on this planet ha ve elaborate defense and control systems 
for free radicals. Some of the body's own free radical scavenging enzymes are called 
glutathione peroxidase, superoxi de dismutase and catalase.   
Antioxidants, often called free radical scavengers, bind with these free radical electrons 
before they can attach themselves to othe r molecules and/or cause cross-linking.  After 
binding with the free radicals, they are excr eted, or passed along to other antioxidant 
molecules and then excreted.  The body produc es natural antioxidants, like superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, catala se and others.  We get vitamin C, vitamin 
E and beta-carotene and some others from so me foods.  We can also take antioxidant 
supplements.  More of this will be covered in the section on nutr itional supplements.  
Specialists in anti-aging medicine sometime s recommend a host of other natural and 
manufactured antioxidants to help combat the effects of aging.   
Researchers have not determined whether aging causes an increase in free radical 
production or causes a decline in free radical scavengers. Studies on aging livers show both 
occurring. One thing is certain: Free ra dicals damage DNA, and damaged DNA makes 
defective proteins, which results in  cells that don't function properly. 
A detailed scientific explanation of the biom edical processes of free radicals in medical 
terms can be found in Dr. Lee-Benner's book "Physician's Guide to Free Radicals, 
Immunity and Aging". 
These are just a few examples of how free radicals  
attack every part of your body  and make you sick and old. 
Reducing your caloric and fat intake  reduces free radical activity. 
A sensible program of antioxidant suppl ements reduces free radical activity. 
One more time: 
Fortunately for you reducing free radicals  
produces a multiple positive effect. 
 
DNA Damage & Mutation,  Errors and Repair  
DNA is a tightly wound and incredibly long chai n of molecules. It is the blueprint for 
life that codes for an immense number of proces ses that result in an organism, and you. By 
coding, I mean that it instructs the proteins on what to do and how to build the components 
of your body. every cell of your body has a copy of DNA.   
DNA is comprised of only four repeating mol ecules, called bases or base pairs. They 
are named adenine, guanine, thymine and cytosine (usually abbreviated A, G, T and C). There are 3 billion "letters", or  base pairs. The gene is compared to a sentence and is the 
unit of instruction in DNA. A chromosome, wh ich are composed of genes of which we 
have 23, are sections of the genome and are often compared to a book.  
Your complete complement of DNA, called th e genome, is often compared to library. If 
all of this were actually in books, they would as stack as hi gh as a six story building.   
SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms, pronoun ced "snips") are the small changes in 
DNA that make us  unique.  
Different kinds of cells have  different parts of their DNA partially unwound depending 
on the type of cell and the partic ular stage of development.  Th is is to allow certain genes 
46 to carry out its particular func tion, which is to code for protei ns that carry out particular 
functions.  
(This section was written circa 2000).  Just a few minutes ago I read in an Email of a 
biotech list that I subscribe to that Celera Genomics and the National Institutes of Health 
have just announced that the genome has been decoded.  This is a monumental event, similar in scope to the first moonwalk.  
Some genetic diseases are caused by changes, or mutations, to just one gene. Sickle cell 
disease results from just one wrong base pair .  Other diseases, like diabetes, cancer and 
heart disease, involve complex interactions between a number of genes. Diseases can and 
do result from DNA damage that occurs as a result of a one’s lifestyle and environment.  
Free radicals damage DNA, environmental toxi ns damage DNA, and unfortunately, even a 
person's natural body functions damage DNA. 
Genomics is the definition a nd analysis of the function of  genes, which are units of 
DNA that  carry out a particular function.  Diseases tend to have a genetic component, 
meaning that the genes interact with things in the environment. 
Pharmacogenomics is the study of how genes interact with drugs.  Some people suffer 
side effects in response to common medicati ons, and others don’t. Likewise, some people 
suffer side effects.  Many diseases, cancer, di abetes and asthma for example, are actually 
groups of slightly different diseases.  Genetic  screening can identify help doctors better 
identify and classify the various kinds of di seases and those people most likely to respond 
favorably or suffer side effects, so th e best drug can be prescribed for them. 
A thorough discussion of gene therapy would take volumes, but simply said, it is 
repairing bad genes. 
But although genes are cool, protei n is where it's really at.  Proteins carry out the genes' 
instructions. So the genome is like a bluepr int in car manufacturing, but the proteome is 
like the set of fabrication drawings that tell the workers how to build the car.   
Proteomics is a key enabling tool for genomics and the study of how proteins 
accomplish this. It considers the composition, structure, function and vast amount of 
interactions of proteins, partic ularly in carrying out the genes'  instructions.  Uncovering the 
function of proteins is much more complicat ed than decoding the genome. Sometimes one 
protein will act on another, which acts on anothe r, and so on to produce a result.  Even with 
genomics technologies, it takes 10 or 15 years to  get a new drug out of the lab.  Proteomics 
may shorten that to perhaps a few years by  id entifying candidates that would be effective, 
and eliminating those that would  be ineffective or toxic.    
Proteomic analysis would identify protein ma rkers of diseases (pro teins thrown off by a 
particular disease), and help doctors better recognize what stage a disease is in.   And 
understanding the form and function of proteins reveals new drug targets. 
A particular kind of protein molecule calle d RNA is created by a chromosome mostly 
from protein.  This RNA copy is like a worki ng blueprint or fabrication drawing to code for 
the building of your body's proteins of which th ere are three types: structural proteins, 
signaling proteins, and enzymes.  Your cells are composed of  structural proteins.  The 
signaling proteins instructing ce lls on what to do.  Enzymes change some molecules into 
other kinds of molecules, they join molecule s together, building mol ecules and disassemble 
others.  All this is carefully regulated a nd there are elegant error checking and repair 
mechanisms. 
When a cell divides the DNA makes a copy of it self so that each of the resulting cells 
will have a copy.  There are errors to the copying which are cumulative.  We have 
47 elaborate repair mechanisms, but as we age th ey are unable to keep up with the damage so 
some of the errors go unrepaired.  
Imagine that coffee is spilled on a part of the blueprint for your new house. It may have 
spilled on a part of the house you don't use t oo much, like a broom closet. Or it may have 
spilled on a part that you use a lot and find really important .  Now the builders don't know 
what to do, and that part of your house gets bu ild badly or not at al l. Your body reacts in 
kind of the same way you would if your hous e had, say, opened windows, no kitchen or a 
broken bathroom.  
DNA damage manifests itself in somewhat th e same way.  DNA replicates itself each 
time a cell divides.  Free radical damage may occur to an important part of the DNA that 
codes for a function involved in immunity, energy metabolis m, or other body function.  Or 
it may damage some of the sequences of the DNA that apparently don' t do anything ("junk" 
DNA).  When DNA is damaged by free radicals this damage gets passed along to its 
copies, which in turn get passed along to those cells' copies, and on and on.  After enough 
of this accumulating damage it's kind of like a 10th or 20th generation xerox copy -- starting 
to get awfully blurred, hard to  read and very dysfunctional. 
High-energy photons like x-rays, microwave ra diation, and sunlight, as well as toxins 
we pick up from our environment damage DNA.   Toxins occur naturally in food, and man-
made toxins include pesticides and herbicides , as well has a vast range of pollutants.  
Medications and taking too ma ny nutritional supplements can be toxic. Your body creates 
toxins in the form of free radicals, enzymes, and acids as part of its metabolic processes 
and defense against infection.  Unfortunately, these too can damage DNA.   There's a lot of 
disagreement over the effects of electromagnetic  fields from electrical power lines and the 
like.  Advocates say it causes  cancer and other diseases, and the power companies and 
other researchers say that it doesn't.  Persona lly, I wouldn't live or raise children near one. 
Toxins can change base pairs, and they can a dd or subtract base pairs to your DNA.  So 
toxins rewrite your DNA.  And as a result the ge ne that has been rewr itten cannot code or 
express itself properly.  
A phenotype is any observable feature of an or ganism that is the re sult of one or more 
genes.  The messages your genes send out can be  triggered or the attenuated by lifestyle 
factors, affecting the way your genes are expres sed.   This could be compared to a factory. 
Even if the proper instructions are present, if the necessary raw materials are not present 
(i.e. food, nutrients, etc.), the result will be a defective product.   So by implementing the 
nutrition, exercise, stress re duction, hydration (adequate am ounts of water), nutritional 
supplementation and other aspects of this  system you are improving your phenotype. 
 
Cross Linkage 
A cross-link is a bond that is formed in error between biological molecules in your 
body.  They reduce the flexibility  and function of your cells and are caused mostly by free 
radicals.   
Cross-linking causes damage to vital conducti ve tissue proteins.  The cross-linking of 
the flexible connected tissue lining blood vessels causes inflex ibility leading to hardened 
arteries, cataracts, loss of lung compliance,  brittle bones and fibrous accumulation in 
muscle, and diseases such as sclerosis, and a declining immune system.   
And worse yet, causes damage to your DNA. 
 
48 Like I said earlier, I don't want you to be bogged down with a lot of reading, but 
would rather have you quickly get into the syst em.  So if you find th at this is just too 
much medical detail, or that it is confusin g, just skim it so th at you get the general 
idea and go directly to chapter 2 on nutrition. 
 Mitochondrial Damage 
An organelle is a specialized structure within  a cell, kind of like an  organ. Mitochondria 
are the energy-producing organelles in the cell s. The mitochondria are receiving a lot of 
attention lately.  They break down glucose  to produce a molecule called ATP (adenosone 
triphosphate), our primary source of energy.  They contain their own DNA and ribosomes 
(intracellular orga nelles concerned with protein synthe sis), they replicate independently, 
and synthesize some of their own proteins. Mito chondria are of very gr eat interest today in 
antiaging.  Every living cell has at least some mitochondria, and cells that require a lot of 
energy, like heart muscle, contai n enormous numbers of them.  Mitocholdria are unlike the 
nucleus in that they lack the ability to repair their DNA.  
The origination of mitochondria is very in teresting. Many scientists believe they are 
independent living creatures th at are descended from living bacteria. Originally these 
bacteria were engulfed by a primordial cell.   A symbiotic relationship was formed -- the 
mitochondria provided energy and the cell provide d protection from the environment.  As 
organisms evolved and became more complex, this relationship remained. 
The bad news is that the energy production pr ocess leads to the formation free radicals. 
Mitochondria are themselves one of the easiest targets of free-radical injury because they 
lack most of the defenses and repair mech anisms found in other parts of the cell.  
The ongoing decline in mitochondrial func tion and the corresponding decrease in ATP 
production as we age is a major contribution to our vulnerability to ag e-related diseases and 
frailty. Evidence now in dicates that mitochondrial dysfuncti on is least partly responsible 
for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, fatigue syndromes at a variety 
of genetic syndromes.  
Extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) 
It has been observed in some lower life forms that various places on the DNA contain 
attached coiled arrays of rDNA (ribosomal DNA) units called extrachromosomal rDNA 
circles (ERCs). This is probably true for most  humans.  The older the cell, the more ERCs 
until an accumulation eventual ly kills the cell.   
Like cross-linking, ERCs inhibit the function of DNA.  ERCs are likely caused by free 
radicals, and inhibited or repaired by ge netic mechanisms (a gene known as Sir
2 in 
particular). 
 
Wear and Tear 
Wear and tear is the idea that the body and its cells ar e damaged by overuse and abuse 
and just wear out. This is especially true fo r the knees -- which is why run on soft surfaces 
and not on concrete (along with avoiding repe titive tasks, bad pos ture, injury and bone 
crushing athletics as infl ammation and arthritis are often the result).   
Another example that comes easily to mind is the wearing out of a hi p.  Cellular wear of 
the bone and cartilage in the hip ball and socket are easy to visualize.  This wear and tear 
also takes place on the gene levels, and is is re lated to the telomere concept that is coming 
up. 
49 Methods covered in this manual can help reverse the aging process by stimulating the 
body's own ability to repair and mainta in the wear of organs and cells. 
 
Telomeres and Telomerase 
Telomeres are the ends of chromosomes c onsisting of sequences of repeating base 
pairs. They are often compared to the plastic ends on shoelaces.  When the plastic tips of 
shoelaces wear out, the shoelace begins to unravel .  This is similar to what is believed to 
happen in your DNA. So the telomere would be a kind of "clocking" mechanism that 
controls the life span  of dividing cells. 
In the wear & tear example above regarding wearing out of a hip, it follows that when 
the cells of the hip that replenish the cartila ge, fluids, etc. can no longer replicate (or at 
least most of them can no longer replicate, and those that are left a poor job and cannot 
keep up in with the additional wearing), that it will no longer function and is worn out.  So 
the hip would be older than the rest of the you. 
Scientists have found that the key element in rebuilding shortening telomeres is the 
"immortalizing" enzyme telomerase, an enzyme found only in germ cells (cells specifically 
involved in reproduction) and cancer cells. Future  development of telomerase inhibitor may 
be able to stop cancer cells from dividing a nd presumably may convert them back into 
normal cells.   
 
Hayflick Limit 
This concept, developed by Dr. Leonard Ha yflick and Dr. Paul Moorhead, relates to 
the limited number of cell divisions describe d in the previous section on telomeres and 
telomerase.  It demonstrates a biological clock within each cell.  It was demonstrated that 
human fibroblast cells (a kind of connective tissue cell found in the lung, skin, muscle, and 
heart.) have a limited life span.  They divide  approximately 50 times over a period of years 
and then suddenly stop.   
Nutrition has an effect on the rate of cell division. Overfed cells made up to 50 
divisions in a year, while underf ed cells took up to three time s as long as normal cells to 
make divisions.  This points to free radical damage.   
Alterations and degeneration oc cur within some cells before  they reach their limit. The 
most apparent changes took pl ace in the cell organelles, membranes and genetic material. 
This improper functioning of cells and loss of cells in organs and tissues has much to do 
with aging resulting from free radical dama ge caused by too much food, and of the wrong 
types of food -- sugar and fats.  
Genetic Control -- Group Selection 
This planned-obsolescence theory focuses on the genetic programming encoded within 
our DNA.  The idea is that it is a selection, or  survival mechanism, for the species rather 
than the individual.  Get the old people who are using up reso urces out of the way so that 
the younger members can better ca re for their young and reproduce.  When that clock goes 
off it signals our bodies first to age and then to die.  
 
Neuroendocrine Depletion 
The neuroendocrine system is the compli cated network found in the brain, nervous 
system and other parts of the body that govern s the release of hormones and other vital 
bodily elements. A hormone is chemical produ ced by a gland that is  secreted into the 
bloodstream and controls the function of distant cells or organs.  When young, our 
50 hormones work together to regulate many bodily  functions, including our responses to heat 
and cold, our life experiences and even our se xual activity (heh heh) .  Different orgasms 
organs (just checking to see whether you're  still paying attention) release various 
hormones, all under the control of a structur e within the brain called the hypothalamus. 
When we're young hormone levels tend to be high.  This accounts for menstruation in 
women and high libido in both sexes, among other things. As we age the body produces 
less hormones, which can have disastrous  effects on our functioning. Human growth 
hormone (HGH), testosterone, estrogen and thyr oid, for example, drop dramatically as we 
age so that even if an elderly person has not gained weight, he or she has undoubtedly 
increased the ratio of fat-to-muscle.  Along w ith this, the number of receptors that receive 
the hormonal signal and cause the next action to take place ma y have decreased or become 
less effective.  So hormone replacement is a delicate matter and requires management by 
an experienced endocrinologise.  Pumping in more hormones isn't always the solution.  
Thus hormone replacement therapy, a frequent component of  an anti-aging treatment, 
may help to reset the body's hormonal clock a nd so can reverse or delay the effects of 
aging. If out hormones are being produced at you thful levels in a very  real sense the cells 
of our bodies are stimulated to be meta bolically active and thus we stay young.   
 
Death Hormone (DECO) 
This one is a lot like wear and tear, telo mere, Hayflick limit & genetic control and is 
considered old school these days by some.  Dr. Donner Denckler, an endocrinologist 
formerly at Harvard University, believed th at the DECO (decreasing oxygen consumption 
hormone), or "death hormone" released by the pi tuitary gland contributed to a loss of about 
10% of neurons. When he removed the pituitary gl ands of rats the rate of cross-linking in 
cells reduced, their immune systems revitalized  and cardiovascular function was restored.  
Dr. Denckia speculated that as we age the pitu itary begins to release DECO which inhibits 
the ability of cells to use thyroxine, a hormone produced by the thyroid-governing basal 
metabolism, the rate at which cells convert  food to energy. The resulting changes in 
metabolic rate bring on and accel erate the process of aging. 
 
Autoimmune Disorder 
As we age, the immune system's ability to produce antibodies to fi ght disease declines, 
as does its ability to distinguish between antibodies and proteins. It becomes self-destructive and reacts against itself. Exampl es of autoimmune diseases are arthritis, 
scleroderma, lupus and adult-onset diabetes. As  we have seen, this can be largely brought 
about by free radical damage.  
Rate of Living  
The German physiologist, Max Rubner, discov ered the relationship among metabolic 
rate, body size and longevity.  In 1908 by introduced the Rate of Living theo ry.  It says that 
we are each born with a limited amount of ener gy. If we use this energy slowly then our 
rate of aging is slowed. If the energy is c onsumed quickly aging sp eeds up. Other rate-of-
living notions focus on limiting factors such as  number of heartbeat s and the amount of 
oxygen inhaled.  But as we know today, exercise (which results in an increase in all the 
above) contributes to grea ter longevity, not less. 
 
Entropy  
This is an overall statement which the othe rs describe.  In Physics, entropy is the 
51 amount of disorder in a physical system, or th e extent to which the energy in a system is 
available.  It is a matter of order going to  disorder. This genera l concept applies to 
biological systems as well.  It can be seen at just about every level, from the higher 
structures, to the cells, down to DNA.  
Waste Accumulation  -- Lipofuscin, Ceroid 
Over the course of time cells produce more wa ste than they can eliminate. This waste 
can include various toxins. Lipof uscin is an excellent example of this waste. Lipofuscin is 
clutter that takes up space and proba bly interferes with function.   
On the surface of the skin, lipofuscin can be seen  as "age spots", or " liver spots".  It is 
the collection of waste in small granules.  Th is is the visible porti on of what is going on 
throughout the body, particularly in the brain and heart.  
It is believed that lipofusci n is an end product of lipid peroxidation (breaking down of 
cell material, particularly membranes, to fo rm more free radicals) or rancidness. Age 
associated changes in enzymes, proteins, nuc leotides, DNA, and cell membranes may all be 
attributed to reaction initia ted by lipid peroxides.   
There is an overwhelming body of evidence suggesting that lipofuscin arises by a 
process of auto-phagocytosis.  Phagocytes  are a kind of immune  cell that destroy 
circulating bacteria, viruses and other forei gn bodies.  Auto-phagocytosis  is when the 
phagocyte makes a mistake and goes after the body's own cells.   
The points are that where there is lipofus cin, damage has taken place and that free 
radicals are the major culprit.    
Thymic Stimulating  
The thymus is the master gland of the imm une system. The size of this gland reduces 
from 200 to 250 grams at birth and then shrinks to around three grams by age 60. Scientists are investigating whether the disappearance of the thymus contributes to the aging process 
by weakening the body's immune system.  
There are studies that have shown that t hymic factors are helpful in restoring the 
immune systems of children born without a thymus as well as rejuvenating the poorly 
functioning immune systems of the elderly. T hymic hormones may also play a role in 
stimulating and controlling the production of  neurotransmitters and brain and endocrine 
system hormones.  This means they may be th e pacemakers of aging itself, as well as key 
regulators responsible for immunity.  
See the appendix for more information on free radicals and DNA damage.

So, Olympians . . . 
52 Are you ready to stop getting beat up in a gl adiatorial lifestyle and join the olympians 
in the triathlon of health, fitness & aging intervention for a very long time? 
Let the games begin!  Now on to the system in the next chapter . . . 
53 If You Have A Medical Condition  If you have a medical condition (disease or injury, 
including psychiatric disease), don't delay -- get the best trea tment right away.  A qualified 
physician may diagnose and be able to trea t something serious in the early stages.  
If you feel bad, that may be an indication that something's wrong.  But if you feel good 
it does not necessarily mean there is not an underlying problem with your health.   
One of the most important parts of a healt h, fitness & aging interv ention program is to 
first uncover and treat any disease conditions or other problems you might have.  Have a 
complete physical exam (which is probabl y long overdue anyway) and get your doctors 
approval before implementing any of  the ideas in this manual.

55 Chapter 3 -- Healthy Happy Eating 
"Tell me what you eat and I shall tell you what you are."  
     Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin 
which has morphed into "You are what you eat."  
 
My Secret Confession 
I have a confession for you.  In my past relationships with 
sweet & fatty foods, I've been no saint.  I have chased after 
cupcakes and been seduced by fr ench pastry. I was infatuated 
with chocolate and had a roving eye for pie.  Loved that custard, 
turned inside out by fudge.   Fa llen for the ineffable charm of 
crème brûlée. Got some donuts when candy was dandy. Cheesecake has turned my head, and definitely had a jones for shortbread.  Had a quickie with a pop tart once -- unsatisfying, 
felt guilty afterward.  Felt a sense of loss when separated from my cookies.  Delighted in a lu rid menage-a-quatre with ice 
cream, cake and fudge.  Had some cheap Trix.  Awakened halfway to dawn in the stillness 
of a sultry summer night to the carnal, visceral desire for the pecan pie that lay beside me.  
Sometimes I even had it with Reddi Whip.  Ahhh, the escapades.  Yep, wallowed with all 
manner of refined sugar and lard.  And don't get me started on my 26-year affair with fast 
food!* 
But you know what?  I hardly ever touch th at stuff anymore because using precision 
nutrition, along with the behavior modification and motivation methods described in a later 
chapter, and just losing the old habits has stabilized my insulin  levels and greatly insulated 
me from these temptations.  And since I've experienced feeling bette r and how much better 
life can be when I stay away from refined sugar and lard, the change in old habits is further 
reinforcing.  I am reformed, and you can be too -- more easily than you may think, and it 
will definitely be rewarding. 
Imagine your own interest in unhealthy foods  just fading away -- of no interest or 
consequence.  You pass by the candy aisle or a fast food restaurant, or whatever your own 
personal temptation, and hardly no tice. Stopping at a fast food joint or an ice cream parlor 
just isn't worth the trouble. It's just not food that's sitting on those shelves -- more like some 
prefab plastic that doesn't make any sense.  This can result from the behavior modification 
and motivation methods to be descri bed, and from a change and habit. 
Staying on track with the system that follows will require some motivation, 
organization and discipline on your part.  It will take some investment of time and will 
surely require some lifestyle changes depe nding on what you’re doing now.  But if you are 
motivated and really want to improve the qua lity of your life and life span, it will become 
fairly easy.  
* OK OK, Although most of this is true , and hot steamy words like "carnal" and 
"visceral" could be used to describe food lu st.  I'll admit, though, that I did take some 
artistic license regarding  the pecan pie.  Actually it wa s Dyana, the creator of the divine 
pecan pie who lay beside me.  Dyana was a love ly young lass (age 51), a girl who would 
take me on incredible journeys to distant pl anets and to meet the many Dyanas within.  
Now back to the pie: To get to the pie I had to get up and go down the stairs and open the fridge. 
 
56 The preceding chapter on why we age descri bed factors many that result from diet.  
You can control many of your agi ng processes with what you eat.  
And what you eat affects your brain as well as your body. This, in turn, affects how you 
feel, your performance, your health, your j oy.  You'll do better with the right foods and by 
avoiding the wrong ones.   
Our bodies are being constantly rebuilt, a nd the food we eat is our raw material.  
Imagine if we build, say, a car out of shoddy mate rials.  It won't run right or last long.  
Well, the same goes for you. 
Either by design, or through millions of years of evolution, or a combination of both we 
are endowed with a system to live in that wi ll chug along and surviv e on a wide range of 
fuels and conditions.  Often these are very bad.  The key word here is “survive”.  May I 
assume that because you are still reading this , you are interested in living a life that is 
beyond survival, beyond the kind of life many people are willing to  settle for?   
I wish you could experience the increase  in energy, the joy of life and other 
benefits you're looking for before making the modest investment in time that it will require. I say "investment in time" because you will probably save money.   
Once you experience the rewards, you will recognize how much you're getting 
from it and be even more motivated, and it  will become even easier.  You can then 
expect it to become so easy it'll be second nature. 
This system isn't about self-denial or ignor ing cravings.  Most of the interest in 
unhealthy indulgences will just drift away -- as though never existed -- replaced by a life 
that's much better.  
Won’t you make the decision to follow this system, leaving room for minor 
adjustments as you find out what wo rks best for you, for 6 weeks?  
You’ve already taken action – this is excellent !  Carry on!  It will be more than worth 
it. The rewards are immense. 
 
Nutritional guidelines fo r nutrition from various 
government agencies and other organizations are 
cautious and generalized.  By now your diet has 
probably already done a lot of damage.  Fortunately, 
much of this damage can be undone and further damage 
can be prevented. 
This nutrition system is designed to "spare" protein 
for its prime role as a building block in cell growth and repair, for increasing muscle  mass and maintenance of 
organ size, bone and other lean body mass.  All of  these tend to decrease as we age.  Note: 
muscle mass is not necessarily mean muscular , although you can have that to if you want.  
This system will also reduce free radical activit y, stabilize insulin and levels, and allow for 
the balanced amounts of monounsaturated fats  to suppress insulin  secretion and for 
sustained calorie reduction and improved energy .  Proper nutrition and more stable insulin 
levels reduce the craving for sweet, fatty junk "foods". 
With this system, the body gets what it n eeds -- and avoids ha ving to deal with 
processing all the muck mo st people throw into it. 
 
Medical Details -- and Follow Your Doctor's Guidance  
Becky and Produce 
57 Review the "friendly" disclaimer at the st art of the manual. Have a complete physical 
exam (which is probably long overdue anyw ay) and get your doctors approval before 
implementing any of the ideas in this manual.  Th is  is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, 
or prevent any disease, and is not intended to provide medical advice or be a substitute for 
a physician. For medical advice, cons ult a properly trained physician. 
Important Note: If you have a medical condition (this includes obesity) . . . Your 
nutrition program may be diffe rent from below.  Consult a physician who is highly 
experienced in nutrition and modify accordingly. 
Prescription medications, and even over-t he-counter medications, cause nutrient 
depletions resulting in nutriti onal deficiencies. This is partic ularly true for the elderly and 
women (particularly those taking estrogen).  People who take a lot of antibotics, such as 
children, are also partic ularly at risk.   
This system is usually a vast improvement fo r most people.  But even better would be 
to take have a program that is customized to the individual designe d by a physician who is 
experience in antiaging nutrition. 
 
Obesity in America 
A government report released by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) said that 61 percent of adult Americans are now considered overweight.  That means FAT!  One in four Americans is now considered obese, up 2 percent from the last survey in 1994. Obese means a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 30 percent of  ideal body weight.  Pick up a 
twenty pound, or thirty or fifty pound or heavier sack of potatoes and carry it around some time.  That's a lot like how it would feel.  It's really tiring and after a while really wears on the joints 
causing arthritis, hypertension, diabet es, coronary artery disease, 
liver and kidney disease. 
 
So here’s the precision, scientific ally designed nutrition system  
 
Overview  
Fasting: Recently this system has been upgraded to include fasting (and drinking only 
water) for 24 hours at least one day a wee k.  There are numerous documented health 
benefits. 
xxxxxxxxxxx 
Have frequent feedings throughout the day -- 6 small, highly nutritious meals.  Large 
meals are slow to digest.  They contain mo re calories than you body can metabolize at one 
time and therefore have to be stored as fat.  Larger meals tend to increase blood glucose, 
and release free radicals and other toxins. The body better absorbs nutrients, and handles 
free radicals, in smaller amounts.  Also, the body does not store 
protein and we need prot ein on an ongoing basis.  
Eating six small meals rather than a lesser number of larger 
ones matches up best with the typical blood-glucose cycle of 
rise, level out and fall.  If you eat more frequently, your body 
has a more controlled response to foods. Going too long 
between meals, or eating snacks causes your body to pump out 
 
Just Produce 
 
58 more insulin when you do eat, causing  too much flux in blood glucose. 
Today there is a lot of talk about “low carb diets”.  Actually, we want “complex” 
carbohydrates” (vegetables, grai ns), but not simple carb diets (sugars, starches). 
The meals should consist of the right balan ce of protein (30-40% in grams), complex 
carbohydrates(40-50% in grams) with low amou nts and the right kinds  of fat(10-20% in 
grams) -- and low sugar, and provide variety in the types of foods. The micronutrient-dense 
complex carbohydrates have great nutritiona l value of their own, and they help you 
assimilate the protein. If have  an exceptionally busy schedule or for some other reason you 
can only make it 5 feedings, well, that  would be OK. But 6 is better.  
We lose muscle mass when we go without eat ing for long periods to time.  If you wake 
up in the middle of the night, one of the meals (protein drink and small amount of fruit works best for me) would be a very good idea.   Since nutritional supplements are best 
taken throughout the day, that would be a good time for some. And, it can really help you 
get a great night's sleep.  But saliva doesn't flow much when we're sleeping.  So when you 
wake up in the middle of the night for some pr otein & carbs, you'll need to give the teeth 
another quick brushing, or at leas t rinse your mouth with water. 
Another alternative is to have  half a protein-drink & carb feeding in the middle of the 
night, then the other half before exercising firs t thing in the morning, then the regular meal 
just after exercising. 
 
a. 3 of the 6 Meals -- Regular “Real” Food -- Protein, Complex Carbohydrates, and a Small Amount of Monounsaturated Fats: 
Protein Foods:   The importance of protein for your  body's structure and function was 
discussed in the "Background" s ection. Proteins are involved  in virtually every vital 
process in your body. 
For protein foods, either skinless  lean chicken (white meat is  generally lower in fat than 
dark), turkey, egg whites or cold-water white me at fish (salmon is preferred because it is 
most rich in EPA (but only salmon grown in  the wild, and not farmed salmon, due to 
unacceptable levels of PCB's and Dioxin contam inants) as well as herring, flounder or sole, 
catfish, sardines, cod and perch), and shellfish.  (Tuna and mackerel ar e also on the list, but 
there have been recent reports of excess merc ury in these kinds of fish). Casein, whey.  
Beef or ham on occasion, prepared without o ils.  Buffalo and venison.   Low-fat cottage 
cheese.  Vegetables with complementary ami no acids -- legumes (beans, etc.) mixed with 
whole grains (like w hole grain rice).  
Bean alert: Green (string) beans have a lot le ss protein than other varieties, so others 
like lima, black or kidney beans woul d be a better choice for protein. 
Choose lean meats and trim fats before c ooking.  Roast, bake, broil, or simmer meet, 
poultry, and fish.  Remove the skin from pou ltry before cooking.  Light meat has less fat 
than dark.  Cook meat or poultry on a rack so the fat will drain off. Avoid prebasted turkey 
or chicken that has been partially prepared be cause they have usually been injected with 
coconut oil. Nonstick cookware and non-stick vegetable cooking sprays reduce the need for 
oil and shortening.  After preparing, chill meat  or poultry broth, stews, and soups until the 
fat solidifies, rises to the top, and can be spooned off. 
Carbohydrate Foods:  Enjoy different kinds of co mplex (high-fiber) carbohydrate 
vegetables -- like broccoli, cauliflower, toma toes, buttercup and butter nut squash, potatoes, 
sweet potatoes, carrots, barley, spinach, brown rice, peas, celery, as paragus, and the like 
along with the protein food.    Steaming your vegetables breaks down their cellulose, which 
59 is indigestible, insoluble and where the nutrien ts are found.  But since I like raw vegetables 
I'll have them raw once in a while. 
Various fruits -- apples, pears, ba nanas, peaches etc. Low-fat yogurt. 
Also oatmeal, and whole grains (like multi-gr ain bread, or cereal that's a mixture of 
grains like rye, barley, oats and wheat), plus a moderate amount of various fruit.  
Occasionally, pasta (semolina, jaro).  
Multi-grain bread -- You're better off if the ingredient list displays  mostly grains, than 
if it includes various sweeteners and sugars , partially hydrogenate d oil, extraneous 
ingredients, and starts out with "Unbleached enrich ed . . . "   This kind of bread will tend to 
spoil more rapidly than others, so keep  it sealed and in the refridgerator. 
Here are lists of ingredients for two representative breads: 
Ingredients: Sprouted Wheat , Sprouted Barley, Sprouted Millet, Barley, Barley, 
Sprouted Lentils, Sprouted Soybeans, Sprout ed Spelt, Filtered Water, Fresh Yeast. 
- and - 
Ingredients: Wheat, Rye, Cor n, Barley, Millet, Oats and Ri ce, with Honey, Water, Salt, 
Yeast and Lecithin. 
Fruit juices are loaded with calories, and do not contain much nutrition compared to the 
great amounts of calories you ar e taking in, so no juice. Do  not use juicers to make 
vegetables into juices.  This results in pert urbing the juice with oxygen radicals -- causing 
free radical damage when you drink it. 
I would have expected that st eaming milk the way it's done in 
coffee houses would have the same effect -- but actually it denatures the protein and makes it more  readily digestable.   
When complex carbohydrate foods are eaten with protein foods, 
they facilitate the uptake, or assi milation, of protein into the cells.  
This is especially important af ter weight training.  One study, 
conducted at University of Texa s Medical Branch, measured the 
amount of uptake of L-phenylal anine (an amino acid) into leg 
muscle tissue after weight training in  three protein shakes.  One type 
of protein shake had protein onl y, another had carbs only, and a 
third had a combination of  prot ein and carbs.  The L-phenylalanine 
uptake in the protein and carb shake was three times higher th an the carb shake and roughly 
twice as great as the protein shake.   
 
So What’s the Deal with “Low-Carb” Diets? 
You want less, or better yet no simple carbs  -- like sugar, white bread and the like.  
Your carbohydrate foods should be comp lex carbs like those described above. 
Fats:  The small amount of fat (generally 10-20% of  total food intake in grams) should be 
primarily monounsaturated fat (like olive, or  canola oil). Olive o il (extra virgin) is 
preferred because of its highe r proportion of mono-unsaturated  oil (85%) to saturated and 
poly-unsaturated, then canola (62%), peanut  (dropping down to 44%) and sesame (just 
42%). 
Also, moderate amounts of essential o ils phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, 
phosphatidylethanolamine and phos phatidylinositol, in a base containing medium chain 
triglycerides (MCTs).  The recommended am ount of these is 1 tablespoon each day. 
 
Emma steaming  
some yummy vegetables 
60 Personally, I tend to keep my eating habits simple and don't do a lot of fancy cooking.  
Modify your own recipes these guidelines.  Ex cellent recipes are ava ilable in the Dr. Lee-
Benner's book, Turning Back the Aging Clock .   
Food absorbs a lot of the oils in which th ey are cooked.  Vegetables absorb fat and 
should never be browned with meat.  The e ffect of cooking varies among foods.  Steaming 
breaks down the fiber allowing you to better absorb  the nutrients. Also, natural toxins in 
plants are killed by cooking. If you can cook for ev ery meal -- great!  Fresh is better.  But 
you can also use a fairly large steaming pot to  prepare almost a week’s amount at a time, 
then keep them the fridge. Fruits should be raw. 
Cooking at lower temperatures is better than  higher because less of the nutrients are 
destroyed, and higher temperatures  cause the formation of more carcinogens.  Nutrients are 
also destroyed when foods are kept warm fo r long periods of time, like in a cafeteria.  
Many nutrients are destroyed when food is frozen and thawed. Most palates are likely to fi nd plain meats & steamed vegetabl es kind of bland.  That goes 
quadruple (like in bypass) for t hose who live to eat.  So it's good to jazz them up a little 
with spices, salsa, or small amounts of pasta sa uce or barbeque sauce -- but be aware that in 
2 tbsp of sauces, calories can range from as little as 10 to 50 or more, and carbs can range 
from 2-15+ (mostly sugar).  This can really add up. 
But your recipes should contain very, very l ittle or no saturated or unsaturated fats, 
sugar or salt. 
b. And the other 3 of the 6 daily meals -- Pr otein powder, Complex Carbohydrates and a 
Small Amount of Monounsaturated Fats :  For protein powder I use an ultrafiltered whey 
protein along with the kinds of carbohydrate f oods described above.  But others like "Milk 
and Egg" protein powders usually availabl e at a lower cost and are acceptable.  
If you're on the run, low carbohydrate protein bars or drinks are a quick and easy 
alternative.  But be aware th at many of them contain inad equate amounts of protein, and 
poor quality carbohydrate and protei n.  Many of them are not much more than candy bars.  
Read the label to make sure you're getting ad equate amounts of protei n.  A protein bar or 
drink should have a minimum of  20-28 grams of protein.   
 
Misc: 
Be sure to have at least 1- 1/2 to 2 oz. of coldwater fish  (wild [only wild] salmon, and 
tuna and sardines are good) each day for the EP A Omega-3 fatty acids), and at least 1 piece 
of fruit. And keep oils refrigerated.   
You'll need a small food scale to weigh th e portions.  Before long you'll get the idea of 
how much various portio ns of food weigh, and can probably use the scale less often.  Small 
scales can usually be found at a local supermar ket or a store that se lls cooking utensils.  
Buy a small notebook and write down everything  you eat for the first two weeks.  It 
really helps motivation when it is “written in the book”. 
 
How amounts of food your nutritional system is computed: 
The amounts of food in this system go al ong with your exercise and other components 
that will be covered later. 
The following percentages are in grams.  Fo r most active people (a lthough this should 
be fine-tuned according to the results of so me advanced tests like those based upon your 
61 apo E allele makeup[genetic testing] from  Berkeley Heart Labs described later), 
consuming:  
40-50% of the diet with high fiber complex carbohydrates like vegetables, oatmeal, fruits 
and whole grains, plus  
30-40% of the diet with high qua lity proteins like casein, wh ey, chicken, beef, fish, dairy 
and eggs, and  
20% fat from olive, nut, fish a nd flax oils, are ideal ranges.  
Since we require around 1 gm. of protei n per day for each pound of bodyweight, and 
we lean towards lower calories, 40% /40%/20% breakdown is recommended. 
 
Amounts of Protein: 
We require around 1 gm. of protein per da y for each pound of bodyweight.   I'll use a 
150 lb. person as an example.  A 150 lb. pers on will need 150 gm. protein each day.  There 
are about 6 gm protein per oz. of meat, so to get 1/2 your protein from meat (75 gm) you 
will need about 13 oz. total, or about 4 oz. each  meal (an amount the size of a 1/2 chicken 
breast).  
Regarding protein powder, a sc oop is usually included in a c ontainer of protein powder.  
There are about 3 heaping tablespoons in each scoop.  Most scoops contain about 18 gm. 
protein.  So to get your  75 gm. from the pow der you will need 4-1/4 scoops per day, or a 
little less than 1-1/2 scoop with  each protein powder feeding.  
With half the protein coming from powders, th e risk of excessive fa t and cholesterol is 
reduced.  Some potential hazards of high pr otein diet and what should be monitored 
include ketone level, kidney and liver functi on, serum uric acid, creatinine urine sediments 
(urate crystals). 
 
Amounts of Carbohydrate: 
If you are the hypothetical 150 lb. person who is having 40% of the daily intake in 
protein as described above, and 40% in comp lex carbs, it again works out to 150 gm. per 
day.   
Steamed vegetables are our first choice in carbohydrate food.  Ther e is a variation in 
the amount of carbohydrate in different foods -- vegetables have around 1-1/2 to 3 grams of 
carbohydrate per ounce, and whole grains have  around 13 to 20 grams.  This depends 
greatly upon their water content.   
Some produce such as apples are grown year round and stored for as long as six months 
before being sold in the market.  Ask your groc er for "new crop" or "fresh crop", which has 
been grown and picked recently.  Toxins are cr eated as vegetables and fruits spoil and they 
are free radical generators, so th ey should be as fresh as possibl e.   Ask your grocer for new 
crop produce. 
Again, we are avoiding (or minimizing) simp le carbohydrates like table sugar, juice, 
honey, fructose, etc.   
 
Amounts of Fats: 
Fat intake should generally be 10-20% of to tal food intake, and it should be primarily 
monounsaturated fat (like olive, or canola oil) , or the essential oils phosphatidylserine, 
phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol.  Keep saturated 
62 and polyunsaturated fat to a minimum.  The reasons for monounsatur ated fats and some 
other background information, were disc ussing in chapter 1 under "Fats".   
Saturated and polyunsaturated fats are consider ed a part of your total fat intake.   
Monounsaturated fat such as olive oil contains 14 grams of fat (10 grams 
monounsaturated, 2 saturated a nd 2 polyunsaturated) and ther e are about 120 calories per 
tablespoon.  
The exact recommended amount of fat intake  within that 10-20% range varies per 
person, and cannot be determined without an adva nced test, such as the one available from 
Berkeley Heart Labs, and expert interpretation.   Dr Lee-Benner  advises us that there are 5 
subclasses of HDL, 7 subclasses of LDL, besi des triglycerides and another deadly molecule 
called lipoprotein(a).  They each act a littl e differently in the body.  The subclass is 
genetically determined.  An apoprotein is a complicated molecule consisting of a carrier 
protein combined with another molecule(s) as a means of transport.  Some apoproteins are 
associated with lipid (fat) molecules such as LD L.  Apoprotein e Isoform is a test of a gene 
that determines the subclass and activity of LDL that you have.  Specifically, it tests the 
activity of the LDL receptor that attaches to the apoproteins found on various lipid particles.  The bottom line is that some peopl e (categorized "E2/2") need fat and do worse  
(i.e. have a higher cardiovascul ar risk and other suboptimal health qualities) when they are 
on a low, or very low, fat diet.  Measurements such as this are not included in typical lab 
tests and require an advanced test such as th e one from Berkeley H eartLab. And of course 
it requires the interpretation of a qualified doctor in this fiel d, and is beyond the scope of 
this manual.   
The traditional standard tests of cholesterol, HDL and LDL have now become obsolete, 
because they do not provide the information necessary to manage your real risks for 
developing coronary artery diseas e, heart disease, stroke, athe rsclerosis or other forms of 
vascular disease such as aortic aneu risms, and even erectile dysfunction.  
To find out how much of a component is in  a particular food, you can use the data 
published by the USDA's Food and Nutrition Center.  This incl udes data on protein, 
carbohydrate, fat and other composition of foods.  Their document Nutritive Value of 
Foods lists a thorough breakdown of these, as we ll as a breakdown of monounsaturated, 
saturated and polyunsaturated fats.  It is available online at no cost at: 
http://www.nal.usda.gov/fni c/foodcomp/Data/HG72/hg72_2002.pdf  
The entire document, or individual pages, can  be printed and used to look up values.  
The food breakdown begins on page 20.

It's much easier to look foods up in the prin ted or hardcopy references, which are in the 
units of measure most often used in the U.S. ( ounces, cups, [broccoli] flower cluster, etc.  
Weight in grams is also listed. 
1 gram = 0.035 ounce (oz., Avoirdupois) 1 (Avoirdupois) ounce = 28.35 grams (1 troy ounce = 31.103 g)

A reference book that lists the amounts of pr otein, carbohydrates and fats in different 
foods.  I use The Complete Book of Food Counts  by Carinne T. Netzer (Dell Publishing).  
Although it doesn't give a breakdown of monoun saturated, saturated and polyunsaturated 
fats like the USDA resource, it's handy and easy to  use, and lists packag ed and fast foods.   
Annual fluctuations, the season and regi on a food was grown in, and other random 
variations may result in the actual amounts of  protein, carbohydrate,  fat etc., in a food 
being different from what's liste d.  Different resources may list slightly different amounts.  
We use the references as a guideline knowi ng that small differences are acceptable. 
If you're not mathematically oriented, stay with the material on calculating the amounts 
of foods that follows.  Once you get used to it , it will become easy -- and it will definitely 
be worth the effort. 
 
Sample Meals and Feedings 
64 On the next page some sample meals and f eedings are described in extensive detail.  
They fit within the 30-40% protein, 40-50% ca rb and 10-20% fat guidelines as much as is 
practical. These (with the exception of extra vi rgin olive oil, protein powder and essential 
oils) are from the "Search the USDA National Nu trient Database for Standard Reference" 
web site at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fni c/cgi-bin/nut_search.pl  
You can use this as a resource, or  use another hardcopy reference. 
For these we are taking the hypothetical 150 l b. person and using the 1 gram of protein 
per pound of body weight per day as a starting poin t, as 40% of the inta ke in grams.  You 
could use these as a basis and adjust accordi ng to your own weight.  For example, if you 
weigh 125 lbs., use 5/6 (or 125/150) of these amounts. 
Values apply to edible portions. You can ma ke them zestier with herbs, spices and 
seasonings. 
These are guidelines -- your measurements don't have to be exactly to the gram, and 
about plus or minus 5% is OK. However, many people find the breakdowns and am ount of detail confusing.  So, to keep it 
simple the four sample meals are described here (They were designe d as one of the six 
meals each day for a 150 lb. person):

The lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet is the most common of the vegetarian diets,  one that does not include animal 
flesh but does use the by-products of the chicken and/or cow (eggs and milk products)  Vegans, or strict vegetarians, do not eat these foods.  In this example we have a balance of 30%-40% protein, 40%-50% 
complex carbs and 20% fat. 
 
Note: In the first meal, broccoli is chosen  as the vegetable because of it's complex 
(high-fiber) carbohydrate content.  Broccoli  has 5.06 grams of carbohydrate per 3.5 oz. 
serving. 
  
 
 
68 Of Course Not Everyone Weighs 150 Pounds 
     Here's how the "Healthy Chicken" meal works out for someone who weighs 120 
pounds.  The first example -- using the 1 gram of protein per pound per day -- then dividing 
that amount of protein into six feedings, th en using a 40%protein / 40% carb / 20% fat 
percentages (and remember, this is in gram s, not volume) -- was designed for a 150 lb. 
person.  The example below is the same meal, but for a 120 lb. person.  So everything is 
just 120/150ths -- the same as 8/10ths, which is the same as 4/5ths -- of the one for the 150 
lb. person:

These meals/feedings are only representative samp les.  The purpose is for you to be able to 
use the information on the "Search the USDA National Nutrient Data base for Standard 
Reference" web site at 
http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic /cgi-bin/nut_search.pl , or a similar resource, to 
be able to design your own, using the 40%protein / 40% carb / 20% fat 
percentages. 
 
Carbs and Protein in Vegetables  
The carbohydrate and protein cont ent of vegetables other than  broccoli are similar. You 
may be interested to find that th ere is protein in vegetables, a nd that we consider it to be a 
part of our protein intake.  An analysis of  the amounts of protein and comparison of the 
percentages of amino acids in beans, rice a nd broccoli appears in the "The Protein in 
Beans" and "The Protein in Broccoli!" sections below.\ 
Here are a very few representative comp arisons taken from the USDA web site. 
 
Broccoli, cooked, boiled, drained, without salt NDB No: 11091 
Cauliflower, cooked, boiled, drained, without salt  NDB No: 11136  
Brussels sprouts, cooked, boiled, drained, without salt  NDB No: 11099  Tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average  NDB No: 11529  
Carrots, cooked, boiled, drained, without salt  NDB No: 11125  
Peas, edible-podded, cooked, boiled, drained, without salt  NDB No: 11301 
69 These are per 100 grams (3.5 oz.)

Cauliflower 4.11 1.84
Brussels sprouts 8.67 2.55
Tomato 4.64 0.85Carrots 10.48 1.09
Peas 7.05 3.27
 
To keep it simple, for carbohydrate amounts I usually  just have about 5 to 5-1/2 oz. of any 
of the complex carbohydrate vegetables. 
  
I know, I know, all this food calcul ation may seem complicated . . .  
It may seem complicated and like it requires t oo much discipline.  But you don't have to 
be exactly to the gram, and about plus or minus a small amount is OK. 
After a short while it will become really easy, and when you experience the results 
and it becomes a habit, you'll be more moti vated and it will become even easier. 
 
You Don't Have to be a Saint 
Constant routine tends to atte nuate the benefits. The good news is that while we keep to 
the kinds of meals and feedings outlined above  most of the time, once in a while, perhaps 
one day a week, it actually can be  beneficial to enjoy food that 's a little "off the system". 
It's good to have a little fun once in a while and have a treat, and can help you utilize the 
fats in your diet.   
And throughout the week while staying on your normal eating habits as described 
above, it's OK to have a small treat.  Dark choc olate is preferred.  Tr y drinking a glass or 
two of water before any treat.  It can make it more satisfying and help  you feel like you've 
had more.  
 
The Above Relates to Change 
Over time, the body becomes used to a cons tant routine and becomes more efficient 
with it, and you don't get the same benefit.  En ergy rates and caloric expenditure decline.  
When you change routine each few days, the body has to adjust to that change.  By changing routine, you force the body to be more efficient and snap out of complacency.  The same is true for muscle training -- when keeping with the same weight training routine 
the muscles become complacent and we lose flex ibility, as well as lose the different kinds 
of development the body can attain. 
 
If You Just Gotta Have Something Sweet & Fatty 
When you're eating the right foods, your inte rest in unhealthy foods decreases greatly 
or even goes away.  At the first sign of an in terest or craving for unh ealthy "foods", just try 
to put it outside of your thought s and go on.  Or just have a sp oonful of your favorite treat, 
or better yet, peanut butter,  or 1/2 cup of Kellogg's All- Bran Extra Fiber cereal.   
If you lean toward fondness for sweet, fatty  foods, like cookies, ice grain cake, candy, 
etc., and this continues after several weeks on this system, only have your fruit with the 
first meal of the day.  In addition to satis fying a sweet tooth, steam ed vegetables, yams, 
whole grains or Kellogg's All Bran Ex tra Fiber can offer you extra fullness. 
70 Chocolate may have at least some health be nefits, so if you really gotta have a small 
sweet treat it may be your l east destructive choice.  It's  rich in antioxidants called 
polypenols and flavonoids, which are found in berries, red wine , green tea, fruits and 
vegetables.  Following the consumption of co coa beverages there is a reduction in the 
tendency for platelets to clot, si milar to the effects of taking a baby aspirin.  Platelets are a 
kind of red blood cell that aid in the normal clotting of blood. If platelets become sticky, 
however, unwanted clots can form and lead to a major heart attack.  
A team at University of California, Davi s conducted an experiment where subjects 
consumed two samples of chocolate a week ap art. The chocolates ha d either high or low 
levels of flavonoids. Blood tests were done on th e participants before they ate the chocolate 
and again two and six hours late r.  After two hours, those wh o had the chocolate with high 
levels of flavonoids had 20 percent more of  the antioxidant in their blood.   The 
participants also showed a re duction in serum leukotriene, a substance that promotes the 
formation of platelets in the blood.   Af ter six hours, all of  the participants' 
leukotriene/flavonoid ratios had returned to nor mal levels. Findings appear in the January

The Mars candy company says that one kind of polyphenols helps neutralize LDL 
("bad") cholesterol.  But they di dn't say is that chocolate is hi gh in calories and fats.  Dark 
chocolate has about twice is much polypenol as  light chocolate.  Wh ite chocolate has none 
-- it's mostly fat.  Chocolate is high in fa t, but not higher than any other snack food.  
 
If You Should Err Big Time 
If you fall off the nutrition system, well, that's  okay.  Just start right up again and do the 
exercises again in the "Behavior Modification & Motivation" section with renewed vigor.  
It can be helpful to pair the "sweet and fatty " with the "unwholesome  and yucky".  Think of 
your favorite treat with something really gr oss as a topping, either sitting there (and 
smelling) all by itself, or us ing the "Big Bang" method.   
And remember, bad habits can take as long as  a year to change.  Just keep trying.  
Much of it has to do with insulin regula tion.  Soon healthy eating habits will come 
naturally. 
Just as insulin receptors become resistan t to the stimulation of insulin over time, 
resulting in an increased requirement to ma ke them function, your sweet receptors do the 
same.  This is another example of health body modifies and three designs itself in response 
to what's going on. So a reduction in your in take of sweets will result in a greater 
enjoyment of very small amounts.  After re ducing their intake, you may notice a kind of 
bitter, tangy or  unpleasant taste that accompan ies processed or sugary & fatty foods, in 
addition to it not being particul arly satisfying anymore. This may be your taste buds way if 
saying it just isn't good for you.   
Trying to just forget about it for a while can really help.  You may notice the desire or 
craving for sugary, fatty foods and particular tim e.  Recognize that pa ttern, and just try to 
hold off for while -- it will go away and you'll feel better, and you'll have a feeling of 
accomplishment. If you tend to feel these crav ings between meals, or right after meals, 
increase the fat in your regular meals -- about ½ to 1 teaspoon of olive oil or peanut butter. 
Steamed vegatables, yams, whole grains or Kellogg's All Bran Extra Fiber can satisfy a 
sweet tooth or offer extra fullness. 
If you find that you absolutely positively must have some decadent treat, just eat half, 
or one-third, or just one bite of it. But if you start munching it you will be tempted to finish, 
71 so divide it first, and immediately throw out th e part that you won't be eating. Or substitute 
a small piece of candy.  Better yet, substitute a small part of a protein bar. 
Each time you just say no to junk food it's a scor e.   It all adds up, at the end the results 
are lifelong, positive changes.   The payoff  w ill be that you will get what your want out of 
life. 
 
Glycemic Index and Insulin Index  
In general you will want foods that are low on the glycemic index.  Glycemic index is a 
measure of how fast carbohydrates in a certain food convert to glucose, which then enters 
the bloodstream and muscles (as glycogen). The glycemic index basically tracks how fast 
your blood sugar rises after eating carbohydrate- dense foods, such as fruits, vegetables, 
grains and processed foods (pasta, bread, cereal s, crackers and cookies are measured most 
often). 
New research indicates that an insulin index is more appropriate than glycemic index.  
With the exception of milk and baked white bread products such as bagels, neither of 
which are recommended here, most foods that are low on the glycemic index are also low 
on the insulin index. 
Consumption of large volumes of  food with a high insulin in dex may play a role in the 
development of insulin resistance, although the link has yet to be conc lusively established. 
See the appendix for more information on the glycemic and insulin indices.

Foods like ice cream have a low glycemic index, but they also have a high fat content.  
Therefore their caloric value has to be consid ered in addition to th eir possible effect on 
insulin response. 
 
The Protein in Beans 
There's variation in the amounts of protein and carbs between diffe rent kinds of beans 
(mature or immature, cooked or canned) -- but in general, the greater the protein, the 
greater the carbs. This seems to have to do w ith water content (more water, less protein and 
carbs, which makes sense).  "Lima beans, large, mature seeds, cooked, boiled, without salt" were chosen above as repr esentative of the lot. 
75 A representative sample of protein and car bohydrate in different kinds of beans:

Rice was a little more consistent (short/med ium/long grain, brown or white).  If you're 
really interested you can look them all up.  
It is said that beans and rice together ha ve complementary proteins (essential amino 
acids) which together make complete protein.  I wanted to see exactly what they are, so I 
ran some numbers: 
76 Comparison of amino acid content -- chicken, rice and beans:

Lima beans, large, mature seeds, cooked, boiled, without salt NDB No: 16072

For most amino acids, the percent content of each amino acid in both beans and rice 
appear close to the percent content in chicken.  This is not to say the amounts are the same.   
Since refined carbohydrates, such as white rice and white bread are quickly broken down in 
the body (causing rapid elevation of blood gluc ose levels) resulting a large release of 
insulin.  See the Glycemic Index above.  So proportionately more beans than rice would be 
a good idea.

78 Johnny's Healthy Protein Shake 
Mix 1-1/2 to 2 scoops Unisyn MRP2 protein powder by Universal Nutrition with 1 cup 
nonfat milk   I know, I know, milk is high on the insulin index (and many people find it 
hard to digest), so I usually only have one of  these a day and the rest of the time just mix 
the protein powder with water.  If the milk  causes you tummy trouble, then try lactose-free 
milk  or substitute water.  
Add about a teaspoon of  low calorie hot choc olate mix or a tablespoon of peanut butter 
for flavor. Add 2 or more tablespoons nonfat yogur t just for the froth of it. Mix it up in a 
shaker cup or blender until nice and frothy.  
Goat yogurt imparts a distinctive fl avor to this shake that can 
only be described as, well, goaty.  I have yet to try this with yak 
yogurt.  Surely, like myself, you have wondered how one would describe the distinctive flavor of yak yogurt.  Well, you can find 
out this and more than you would ever want to know about those 
lovable beasts at http://www.animalinfo.org/species/artiperi/bos_mutu.htm .   
 
The OK to Eat List -- probably won't hurt you 
Lettuce doesn't really have much nutrition.  It’s mostly water and crunch, and falls 
under the category of innocuous "f un" food.  But many salad dressi ngs contain lots and lots 
of fat.  So if you want your lettuce or if you are a rabbit, have some lettuce without the 
dressing. 
 
The Normally NOT OK  to Eat List  
Anything that was once food, but has been pulverized, compressed, boiled in fat, and 
loaded up with sugar and salt.  As expecte d, these include processed "foods" containing 
added fat, sugars or salt.  
All the usual suspects: pastry, doughnuts,  ice cream, cookies, candy, potato & corn 
chips, soda, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, french fr ies, fruit juices and juice-flavored drinks, 
rolled-up dried "fruit", toaster pastri es, and most prepackaged lunches.   
Sadly, many of the above are pack aged and marketed to children. 
A food that says "Healthy" on the label isn' t necessarily your most healthful  choice. 
On a television program I once heard a junk food industry representa tive describe his 
product as having "snack value", whatever the he ck that is.  Almost invariably packages 
labeled "low fat" will mean high-calorie, a nd "lite" will be "not a lot of pounds" -- and not 
low fat, low sugar, healthful and nutritious. 
Fruit juices, from fruit or blended, cont ain far too little nutrition for the immense 
amounts of sugar and calories. Vitamin C in juic e is lost soon after e xposure to light, heat, 
air or metal.  Popular tomato/vegetable juice blends have been pasteurized, resulting in the 
destruction of nutritional conten t.  With an average of 160 cal ories each, sodas are probably 
the greatest source of sugar in the Amer ican diet.  Holiday eggnog has a whopping 340 
calories a glass, while white wine has only about 70 per 3.5 oz. glass. 
New animal research suggests that fat-lade n meal plans can take a toll on the brain by 
starving it of its energy supply. 

79 Foods with polyunsaturated fats, as well as sa turated fats should also be shunned. Most 
people eat too much fat because they don't know what they're eating.  Cooked chicken from 
a supermarket deli are usually fatty birds and should only be resorted  to the most hungry of 
situations.  Ditto with many fast food restaurant  chicken sandwiches.   One exception is the 
"Koo Koo Roo" chain, which does a real good job of providing low-fat and healthful 
chicken and side orders. 
As previously mentioned, most salad dressing contains lots and lots  of fat.  Nuts and 
seeds are typically load ed with fat and they’re usually ra ncid by the time they get to your 
home – therefore, filled with free radicals. Also, nuts sometimes contain aflatoxins, which 
are cancer causing molds.  
The recent "Got Milk?" ad campaigns are abso lutely brilliant exam ples of fabricating 
some drama to motivate us to buy something th at, in my opinion, isn't nearly as nutritious 
as some other foods you could be using to build your body as, say, broccoli. Milk lacks 
complex (high-fiber) carbohydrate and it's high on th e insulin index.  Milk is great for baby 
cows, but in humans it can lead  to a number of maladies. H eart disease begins to show up 
around the age of 3.  After age 3 you don't need  milk, and breast milk is better for the 
immune system.  
The milk from one species just isn't desi gned for other species. Around 50%-85% of all 
people lack adequate amounts of the enzyme  lactase which breaks down lactase (milk 
sugar)  This is lactose intolerance  which mean s they can't digest it and get sick because it 
spoils in their digestive tracts.   And we are the only species on  earth that I know of (maybe 
with the except of domestic farm animals like lambs who will surreptitiously nurse from a cow, cats who will wait along the sidelines wh ile the cows are being milked hoping for a 
free squirt or two, or maybe ants who "milk" th e nectar from aphids) that has figured out 
how to get the milk out of other species.  Bu t that's why we rule th e world and are the only 
species who has figured out how to make potato chips. 
Barbecue, smoked and pan-fried meats contai n a lot of heterocyclic amines (HCAs). 
HCAs are created when heat breaks up amino acids and creatinine and provoke free radical 
activity.  HCAs cause DNA mutations and colo rectal, esophageal, long, liver, intestine, 
prostate, liver and breast cancers. 
There is a lot of sensationalism regarding the artificial sweetener Aspartame, or 
NutraSweet.  But there have been very rare occurrences of neurotoxicity for some people, 
especially infants.  It contai ns Methyl Alcohol, which is sa id to be highly toxic and can 
cause recurrent headaches, behavioral disorders,  seizures, suicidal tend encies, birth defects, 
skin lesions and urinary bladde r disturbances, and some new re search suggests that people 
who consume a lot of aspartame are more likel y to suspect they have memory problems, 
typically of the type where you forget whether you did something.  Did I say that already?  
But representatives of NutraSw eet's maker maintain there's no evidence that the sweetener 
does anything to affect memory and resear chers have not demonstrated conclusive 
evidence for memory problems.   
According to the NutraSweet company, aspa rtame is manufactured mainly from amino 
acids, which make up protein. While it has about  the same caloric makeup as sugar, it is 
much sweeter, meaning that much less is requi red to sweeten a food or drink.  And as I 
mentioned, there's a lot of sensationalism, and side effects are very rare, and I still have 
drinks with aspartame myself. 
Toxins are created as vegetables and fruits spoil and they are free radical generators, so 
they should be as fresh as possible.  
80 OK, OK, it’s hard not to be tempted when you ’re out with friends or over the holidays.  
A guy or a gal has to have a little fun once in a while.   In addition to this nutrition regimen, 
some days I’ll have just one treat that’s around 50-100 calories (about 1/3 a chocolate bar) 
and still stay really sharp.  If you must , then chocolate is the least undesirable. 
It would be all right to, maybe  once a week, indulge in a slic e or two of pizza, a candy 
bar or a scoop of ice cream.  OK, I’ll throw in a cookie.  But – don’t be surprised if the next 
morning you’re just not quite as  alive and energized as usual,  and it takes you the rest of 
the day to get back to your usual self. 
Just don't keep junk foods around the house. It is great when you get to the point where 
you follow this automatically and have just lost the desire for unhealthy foods.  Choose 
"high water content" foods, like fresh produce,  how cereal and the like, over low water 
foods like dried fruit, nuts, and snacks.  1/4 cup of raisins contain 100 calories -- the same 
as two cups of grapes. 
Actually, the oil in peanut butter is ar ound half monounsaturated, or the "good fat" 
that's also found in olive and ca nola oils, and to a lesser amount in peanut and sesame oils.  
If you get a tummy upset or gas, have some unflavored yogurt providing friendly 
flora/acidophilus & bifidus, and some pineap ple or mango 3-4 times a day for a few days, 
and stay in touch with your doctor.  The "f ruit" on the bottom of yogurt is really mostly 
sugar. 
When I first started this meal system I had been vigorously working out with weights.  
But I just wasn’t getting enough protein to suppo rt that strenuous rou tine.  In fact, I was 
protein deficient.  At firs t the protein drinks tasted really good!   After a few months they 
started tasting a little less desirable, for me a nyway.    But what really spices up the old 
protein drink is a spot of yogurt, and if you n eed a little added sweetne ss, a small amount of 
the “fruit” (actually some kind of jam or suga ry compote) that come s on the bottom of a lot 
of yogurts.   
 
Why Too Many Calories, an d Sugars, are Really Bad 
OK, would you pump maple syrup (a fine source of energy) 
in the gas tank of a superbly de signed, snazzy sports car then try 
to hurl down at the Bonneville Salt Flats at about 3000 mph?  
You probably wouldn’t even put dies el fuel or regular gas in a 
car that was designed for pr emium.  Suppose the tank was 
overfilled and gas ran over and corroding a brand new paint job.  
That’s what eating the wrong foods  and overeating is like.   
And imagine a car that was c onstantly being repaired and 
rebuilt, depending on the kinds of gas and o il you used.  Would you rebuild your fenders 
out of cardboard and the e ngine out of cheap tin?  
Excusez-moi for the car analogy (and pardon my French).  Sure, this is a little obtuse.  
But I'm trying to anchor this idea in your  mind.  Our bodies do operate on physical 
principles.  Like a house or car -- if we build it out of quality  materials it will last a long 
time, and if we build it out of flimsy materials it will crumble.  And if we subjected to a lot 
of stress, it will break down, and so forth. 
If you're going to hurl down the Bonneville Sa lt Flats, you'll want the strongest frame 
and an engine that has been built from the highest quality components. 
This is just what most people do to something that is a lot more valuable to them than a 
snazzy sports car: their bodies.  Lucky for us the body isn’t nearly as finicky as a car and 
 
The Rockefellers and their 
snazzy sports car 
81 won’t stop running when being fed a lot of muc k.  Either by design, or through millions of 
years of evolution, or a combin ation of both we are endowed w ith a system to live in that 
will survive on a wide range of fuels and conditi ons – often very bad.  The key word here is 
“survive”.  May I assume that because you are still reading this, you are interested in living 
a life that is somewhat beyond what most people are willing to  settle for?   
Eating too many calories set about a chain of processes in your body that "eat" you 
alive . . . from the inside!   The destructiv e effects of glucose in the blood have been 
previously described.  But the biggest offende r in this chain of events is free radical 
damage, which we also discussed earlier.  Studies have linked sugar with degenerative 
diseases which accelerate aging -- and reduce lifespan 16-25 percent.   
But we like it.  Why?  We have a geneti c predisposition to store up on calories for a 
famine, as well as a preference for sweet foods which are less likely to be poisonous than, 
say, bitter foods. 
Sugar also increases blood pre ssure, heart rate, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and total 
cholesterol.  Reducing fat in the diet does not improve these levels unless dietary sugar is 
removed from the diet.   S ugar loading causes high uric acid, inorganic phophorous, SPOT, 
and triglycerides.  There is a strong correla tion between sugar intake  and breast cancer in 
older women.  During exercise, high sugar can impair muscle performance.  Sugar loading 
can be responsible for the pain, joint stiffness, and degeneration of arthri tis of the spine.  
Many people are particularly sens itive to sugar.  And in the previous section we saw how 
sugar causes an insulin spike. 
And when we are stressed , the brain releases a chemical called corticotropin-releasing 
hormone, or CRH, that suppresses appetite. The adrenal glands then secrete their powerful 
fight-or-flight stress hormones, adrenaline a nd cortisol, which propel sugar into the 
bloodstream for a short-term energy rush. Afte r that rush, cortisol sparks the hunger for 
carbohydrates and fat.    
And all this means accelerated aging for you. 
Reducing sugar consumption will improve your health. 
Did I mention that sugar can cause tooth decay? And it doesn’t matter where you get your sugar – sucrose,  fructose, glucose, honey, 
lactose, maltose, or other “natural” sweetener s are just about the same.   This includes 
"raw" sugar.  And, sugar is habit forming.  The good news to this is that a sugar habit can 
be broken.  So if you crave sugar, you can get ov er it.  If you really must have sugar, limit 
it to 28 grams (1 oz.) per day.  That's a few teaspoons. 
 
Why Polyunsaturated Fats, and Most Other Fats are Really Bad For You 
Unsaturated (polyunsaturated) fat produces just  as much fat blockage  in the capillaries 
as saturated fat, and it often hangs around longe r in the bloodstream. Unsaturated fat is no 
better at protecting against the ri sk of heart attack or death th an saturated fats.  And they 
cause coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis.   This was determined in scientific studies 
as early as the '60s. 
Polyunsaturated fats were once advertised as practically a kind of health food. They are 
often used by food processors and in restau rants because of their low cost.  Although 
saturated fats and cholesterol ha ve been shown to be a major factor in atherosclerosis and 
heart disease, polyunsaturated fats are a major source of free radicals.  Although 
polyunsaturated fats do reduce bloo d cholesterol, at the same time they increase the amount 
82 of cholesterol in the arterial  plaques, artery wall, liver, and other tissues.  Through free 
radical production this causes heart disease, cancer in various places in the body, especially 
in the breast, prostate and colon.  Promoti on of initial tumor growth is now thought to 
require a minimal amount of unsaturated fat,  and they have been shown to suppress the 
immune system in laboratory animals.   
Polyunsaturated fatty acids become rancid (a  further source of free radicals) within 9 
days of opening the container and being exposed to air, long before you can detect a rancid 
flavor or odor.  This occurs even if they contain preservatives. To  preserve cooking oils, 
add the contents of a 250 mg capsule of BHT (Butylated hydroxytoluene) to each 16 oz. of 
oil.  Still, it will go rancid in a couple of weeks.   BHT is av ailable in health food stores.  
And do not save or reuse cooking oil. 
Olive oil is a monounsaturated fat.  Co conut and palm oils, for example, are 
particularly highly saturated.    
 
Why Protein and Complex Carbohydra tes are Critical in This System 
The reasons that protein and complex carbs are vital to you was covered in pages 1-6 of 
the Background chapter.   If you missed this, please read it now. 
 
Variety 
Eating a variety of foods is essential because it will better assure a range of nutrients 
that are vital to your health.  Variety also avoids possible toxicities that can accumulate 
from the soil additives, sprays and even undesirable natural substa nces found in foods 
themselves. Eating a varied diet can help mi nimize exposure to any particular additive. 
Some people develop hypersen sitivities when eating the same foods again and again. 
Besides, variety keep s it interesting.   
 
Weight Loss 
Although this isn’t a weight loss system per se, most people who are somewhat 
overweight but not obese will come to something near their ideal weight with this system.  
But on this system you are likely to exchange fat for muscle -- a very good thing. I'm not 
saying you'll necessarily want to become "mus cular" (you can if you want to), but you'll 
definitely become more defined. More of this  in the section on exercise.  And exercise 
lowers your appetite set point  -- so you'll be less hungry. 
 
Crash Diets 
Crash diets -- losing lots of pounds in a short period -- are dangerous.  Permanent 
weight loss must be a slow process.  Most pe ople resume their former eating habits after a 
crash diet.  This can result in an upward spiral  of ever increasing weight. In response to the 
deprivation, our bodies lower the metabolic rate in order to conserve energy and increase 
fat storage.  But the metabolism does not return to its former level after a crash diet when 
normal habits are resumed.  So the more we star ve ourselves, the faster  we regain the lost 
weight after we begin to eat ag ain. The dieter gains weight even more quickly than before, 
and on less calories than it would have previously taken to gain  weight.  Repeat offenders 
gain weight on less than  1000 calories per day! 
Dieting along to lose weight causes the body to  lose muscle more than it does fat.  
Therefore, during re-feeding the body put s on more fat but no more muscle.  
83 The body's main fuel is glucose, which is most easily obtained from carbohydrates.  If 
glucose is unavailable (as in a crash diet ) the body's most efficient way of obtaining 
glucose will be to get it from protein in the di et.  So it will disassemble your muscle (this 
can cause atrophy of the heart), and your organs  and the infrastructure of your body to burn 
as fuel.  Many people who have been on a lot of  crash diets have faces that look thin and 
drawn because they have lost  a lot of facial muscle. 
Fat loss comes from burning calories through exercise, and weight training, which 
builds muscle.  Muscle burns more calories, therefore increasing fat loss. 
Glucose is obtained from fat very poor ly. If carbohydrate remains unavailable for 
several days the body will try to conserve it 's protein by producing an alternative fuel 
source by partially burning fatty acids, called ket ones.  Keytones serve as a substitute for 
glucose and help keep the centr al nervous system running -- a lthough it does not fuel all of 
the central nervous system cells. As fat brea kdown continues, these keytones will build-up 
of the blood causing an abnormal condition cal led ketosis.  The blood becomes more 
acidic, so there is a chemical imbalance with pote ntially serious side effe cts.  Yes, there is a 
dramatic weight loss during the first week or so.  Unfortunately it's mostly water, not fat, 
and is quickly regained later. 
The diet industry is a very big business.   But many diets just don't work or are 
downright harmful. Some appetite suppressants are habit forming.   
Weight loss must be a slow process.  So we  want to coax the body to alter its hunger set 
point by feeding it the kinds of foods and on the schedule recommended in this system.  
This may take some time, maybe a few months.  
As caloric intake drops, the margin of safety  for essential nutrient s becomes narrower.  
Everyone is different and caloric and nutri ent requirements differ among people. So 
responses to changes in food intake are highly variable. A person who is greatly 
overweight should be undertak e a personalized health, fitness and aging intervention 
program initially focusing on permanent wei ght loss, designed by a physician who really 
understands it.   
 
Processed Foods 
Many of us have an innate hereditary desire  to eat sugary and fatty foods in order to 
store up the sugar and fat that were once sc arce and therefore valuable. Although nutritious 
fruit tastes sweet, today unhealt hy sweet and fatty foods today are available on every street 
corner and at a relatively low cost.   
Today we take perfectly natu ral and good food and pulverize it,  compress it, boil it in 
fat, then load it up with sugar and salt. A nd there are automated factories that produce 
gooey emulsions that go through nozzles and splat  onto cardboard-like wafers or into 
plastic containers. Now that the wholesome i ngredients are rendered almost totally devoid 
of the nutrients our body needs, and a lot of ot her stuff that will hurt us is added, we eat it 
and actually enjoy it. And here's the kicker  -- processed foods cost more money than 
natural fruits and vegetables!!  When it co mes to food, our affluence may also be our 
downfall.  
Companies that sell processed food are ve ry good at knowing how  to manufacture food 
with tastes that will sell, and how to keep their production costs low. They know the way to 
make foods "taste better"  and sell more is to add more sugar and more salt.  But natural 
foods are less expensive, likely because there is no cost to process them and because they don't have to be marketed. Don't be fooled. 
84 Sure, like tobacco, it doesn't kill you immedi ately.  But not only will processed foods 
kill you in the long run (partially  because of the content, an d partially because you're not 
taking in what the body needs), but processed foods reduce the quality  of your life because 
your body and brain are not getting th e nutrients to run effectively. 
 
"Natural" Foods 
Imagine the products that could be calle d "natural".  Pois on ivy typically (and 
naturally) grows at the edge of  the field, forest, parking lot, or road, and only 1 nanogram 
(billionth of a gram) needed to cause rash.  You wouldn't trust your face to a poison ivy 
skin crème, would you? 
The phrases "natural", "all na tural ingredients" and the li ke are questionable.  If you 
read the list of ingredients you will often find lots of suga r and salt which are themselves 
quite natural. And because something is natural,  such as natural herbs, does not mean it is 
necessarily safe.    
There are no standards for what natural means -- you really don't know what you're 
getting.  And "natural" doesn't mean pure or cl ean either. According to  the cosmetic trade 
journal Drug and Cosmetic Industr y, "all plants [including those used in cosmetics] can be 
heavily contaminated with bacter ia, and pesticides and chemical  fertilizers are widely used 
to improve crop yields." 
 
Chew Your Food Well 
Digestion begins with chewing. Inadequate  chewing and eating on the run are major 
causes of poor nutrient absorption.  Chewing is the first step in car bohydrate digestion and 
mixes enzymes with food.   An enzyme causes food to break down into simpler structures 
that can then be absorbed by the intestines. 
If your food isn’t chewed well,  the pancreas must take over later.  And mouth enzymes 
are needed to activate intestinal enzymes.  Undigested food particles leak out through the 
gut and the immune system treats it as an inva ding virus or bacteria, with a resulting food 
allergy. 
This is exacerbated as time goes on, as ag ing results in a decreased production of 
hydrochloric acid and digestive enzyme secretion.  Also try to not eat on the run, as a more 
relaxed body better secretes digest ive juices and absorbs nutrients. 
 
Omega-3 Fatty Acids and EPA 
Sometimes while in my local market I imagine I'm the eskimo hunter named 
"Nanookie".  Permafrost crunches beneath my boots as I walk, the cold north wind whips 
against my face, icicles dangle from my nose.  W ith great stealth I approach the fish cooler.  
My heartbeat quickens.  I crouch low, then faster than you can say "Let's rub noses like the 
eskimoses"  I hurl my finely honed spear into the cooler and land a 12 pound Alaskan 
salmon fillet!  Bystanders cheer! Clerks a pplaud my ever improving prowess! The meat 
dept. manager dials 911!  I'm filled with ar ctic joy, secure in the knowledge that my 
arteries are clear because fish from cold water characteristically and uniquely contain 
significant quantities of long chain omega-3 fatty acids!   
Natives of the Pacific Northwest, Greenland Eskimos and Japanese fishermen consume 
large amounts of cold water fish.  As a result, they rarely develop coronary artery disease.  
It's the omega-3 fatty acids from fresh fish that  contribute to this re duction in disease.   
85 By the way, the skill and resourcefulness of the peoples of the Pacific Northwest are 
pretty awesome. The Chinook, for example,  were master fishermen and exceptional 
canoeists. A single canoe and crew, using large nets of their own construction, could catch 
two tons of salmon on a single outgoing tide.  Th ey were so wealthy they could afford to 
devote two months each winter to spiritual and artistic pursuits.  
Anyway, back to omega-3 fatty acids. The term "Omega-3 Fatty Acid" is a biochemical  description of the molecular structure.  
Fats were described in the b ackground chapter.  Each fatty acid molecule has a chain of 
carbon atoms, to which hydrogen atoms are bound.  In fats, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen 
is somewhere around 1 to 1.  
Regarding the acid part -- In chemistry there are several definitions of what comprises 
an acid, but basically it is an acid because of its hydrogen.  But fatty acids are much weaker 
than, say, battery acid or stomach acid.  
The "omega-3" designation identifies the pr ecise chemical location of some of the 
unique structural features of the molecule.   
All fatty acids are chains of carbon atoms with oxygen atoms hooked on at one end (the 
alpha end), and three hydrogen atoms hooked on at the other end (the omega end). Bonds 
are molecular connections. Fatty acids di ffer based on how many carbon atoms are strung 
together, and where there are double bonds (two molecular connections) between the 
carbon atoms instead of single bonds. 
A double bond (two molecular connections), is located at the thir d carbon atom from 
the omega end. 
Omega-3 fatty acids have the first do uble bond three carbon atoms away from the 
omega end. 
Similarly, omega-6 molecules have the first double bond located on the 6th carbon 
from the end, and are termed omega-6 fatty acids or omega-6 polyunsaturates. 
There are two kinds of omega-3s, those with  a short chain length (18 carbon atoms or 
less) and those with a long chain length ( 20 carbon atoms or more). The difference is 
critical, since the body requires the long chain omega-3s, and doesn’t seem to have any 
particular direct use for the short chain vers ions.   It is questionable whether the body 
converts the short chain versi on to the long chain version. 
These are "essential" fatty acids .  Essential fatty acids, like essential amino acids are 
essential in that they cannot  be manufactured by the body, so they must be obtained 
through diet.  
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is one kind of omega-3 fatty acid. Omega-3s are 
considered safe from lipid peroxidation (ra ncidness -- breaking down to form more free 
radicals). 
EPA's action is to inhibit the negative effects of free radicals. EPAs particularly in the 
food and useful in preventing lipid peroxidation that is highly descruc tive to the brain and 
heart.   
Arachidonic acid (AA) gets incorporated in to your body's cell phospholipids.  This is 
bad. EPA acts as a competitive inhibitor of AA.  This means that the EPA binds to the cell 
before the AA gets into the cell. 
Omega-3's lower the rate at which triglyce rides are manufactured by the liver. They 
have antiinflammatory effects, and inhibit platelets from sticking together and from 
86 adhering to the endothelium (inner lining of bl ood vessels, lymph channels and elsewhere).  
Their they lower blood pressure, and help re pair the damage caused by lack of oxygen to 
body tissue. 
Omega-3 supplements are to be avoided.  Some are extracted from the livers of fish and 
contain large amounts of vitamins A and D, wh ich can be toxic in large amounts. They are 
highly unstable and undergo rapid peroxida tion when exposed to air during their 
preparation and while in the capsule.   
Some fish oils are high in cholesterol, so people who are treating in  the territory of high 
cholesterol should be monitored. 
As previously mentioned, eat at least 1.5 oz. of fresh fish each day.  Salmon is preferred 
because it is most rich in EPA. 
Farmed salmon does not have omega-3s.  A nd it has been recently discovered that 
unacceptable levels of PCB's and Dioxin contaminants get into farmed salmon.  Someday 
this problem will be eliminated, but for the present, I recommend Wild-Type Salmon only. 
 Mackerel, herring, flounder or sole, catfis h, tuna, sardines, cod and perch are also 
good.  
The Food and Drug Administration has warned pregnant women to avoid certain types 
of dark meat fish, particularly shark, swordf ish, king mackerel and tilefish because they 
contain unusually high concentrations of mercur y. These are typically older fish so they've 
had more time to absorb the mercury.  High levels of mercury may harm an unborn baby's developing nervous system.   FDA is also  advising nursing mothers and young children to 
avoid these fish as well.  The FDA also says "there are many varieties that pose few health 
risks and many benefits, particularly for pregna nt women."  Surely these levels of mercury 
would be bad for anyone, not just unborn and nursi ng babies, so I avoid th ese kinds of fish.  
Recently there are reports of  excess mercury in swordfish, shark, tilefish, halibut, 
mackerel, sea bass, and tuna. 
I talked with the clerk in the fish department  at my local market this morning regarding 
the possibility of mercury in salmon and other kinds  of fish.  He said that he was aware of 
this problem in shark and swordfish, but not salmon.  His salmon are farmed (farmed is no 
longer recommended due to contaminants -- only salmon grown in the wild are recommended) and come from Alaska, Wa shington, Chile, and all over the world. And 
"Atlantic" salmon is just a name and doesn't necessarily come from the Atlantic Ocean. 
The reasons for shark, swordfish etc. is that they tend to be older fish have had more 
time to pick up the mercury. There are some  100+ year old rockfish being caught. You 
could probably take your temper ature with one of them!  
 
Food Safety 
Stay out of the way of food traveling at a high rate of speed, and other forms of fast 
food.  Ha!   :o)  
OK, enough yaks for a while.  Here are the real tips on food safety:  Wash you hands 
thoroughly with warm water before and after handling all foods, especially raw meats.  
Always wash fruits and vegetables before eat ing. Fresh meat, poultry and fish are best, but 
if frozen, thaw them in the refrigerator or  microwave oven or under cold water -- never on 
a countertop.  Wash your countertops after meat  has come in contact with them, especially 
chicken.  This would prevent the transfer salmonella infec tion and other kinds of food 
poisoning.

RDA, DRI and other Nutritional Recommendations 
Currently, the Food and Nutrition Board of  the National Academy of Sciences is 
evaluating and revising the Recommended (not  required) Daily Allo wances (RDAs). New 
recommendations, called Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), have  been established for those 
nutrients that have undergone  this review process. 
The Dietary  Reference Intakes (DRIs) are valu es that are   quantitative estimates of 
nutrient intakes to be used fo r planning and assessing diets for healthy people.  The DRI is 
include both recommended intakes intolera ble upper intake levels.  The DRI's are 
determined by the Institute of medicine, a private, nonprofit organization that provides 
health policy advice under government funding to  the National Academy of Sciences.     
Over the next few years, the DRI's will repl ace the RDAs.  The DRI's represent a shift 
in emphasis from preventing deficiency to de creasing their risk of chronic disease through 
nutrition.    
The DRIs are actually a set of four refere nce values: Estimated Average Requirements 
(EAR), Recommended Dietary Allowances (R DA), Adequate Intakes (AI), and Tolerable 
Upper Intake Levels, (UL) that have repl aced the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowances 
(RDAs).

Fresh Foods Taste Better, Organ ic Food and Food Additives 
The bottom line: fresh organic foods are not more nutritious, or safer, or better than 
other kinds of food.  But they are better ta sting, and growing them is a lot easier on the 
environment.  For these reasons I have begun to  do most of my shopping in stores offering 
certified organic. 
The U.S. Department of Agri culture has put in place a set of national standards that 
food labeled "organic" must meet, whether it is grown in the United States or imported 
from other countries.  Any farm, wild crop ha rvesting, or handling operation that wants to 
sell an agricultural product as organically pr oduced must adhere to the national organic 
standards. 
But -- it's a big question as to how the USDA verifies producers' claims. The USDA definition of organic food: Or ganic food is produced by farmers who 
emphasize the use of renewable resources a nd the conservation of soil and water to 
enhance environmental quality for future ge nerations.  Organic meat, poultry, eggs, and 
dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.  
Organic food is produced without using most c onventional pesticides; fertilizers made with 
synthetic ingredients or sewage  sludge; bioengineering; or ionizing radiation.  Before a 
product can be labeled "organic," a Government -approved certifier insp ects the farm where 
the food is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meet 
88 USDA organic standards.  Companies that handl e or process organic f ood before it gets to 
your local supermarket or restau rant must be certified, too. 
Under the rule, meat and dairy labeled organi c must come from animals that are raised 
on organic grains or grasses, given access to the outdoors and have not been treated with 
antibiotics and growth hormones. 
See http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/  for details. 
There are four labeling categories.  For example, cereal with  100 percent organic 
ingredients can be labeled " 100% organic" and carry the se al; cereal with 95-100 percent 
organic ingredients can be labele d "organic" and carry the seal; cereal made with at least 70 
percent organic ingredients can say "made with  organic (and list orga nic ingredients); and 
cereal with less than 70 percent organic ingredients.  Products with less than 70 percent 
organic ingredients may list specific organically  produced ingredients on the side panel of 
the package, but may not make any organic cl aims on the front of the package.  Look for 
the name and address of the Government-appr oved certifier on all pa ckaged products that 
contain at least 70 percent orga nic ingredients.  See the following web page for the seal and 
examples.

20250. 
This page will tell you about the de finition, standards and practices.   
http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/FactSheets/ProdHandE.html  
Regarding animals, the livestock standards apply to animals used for meat, milk, eggs, 
and other animal products represented as  organically produced.   It says:  
Animals for slaughter must be raised under or ganic management from the last third of 
gestation, or no later than the second day of  life for poultry. Producers are required to feed 
livestock agricultural feed pr oducts that are 100 percent orga nic, but may also provide 
allowed vitamin and mineral supp lements. Producers may convert  an entire, distinct dairy 
herd to organic production by providing 80 pe rcent organically produced feed for 9 
months, followed by 3 months of 100 percen t organically produced feed. Organically 
raised animals may not be given hormones to  promote growth, or antibiotics for any 
reason. Preventive management practices, includi ng the use of vaccines, will be used to 
keep animals healthy. Producers are prohibited from withholding treatment from a sick or 
injured animal; however, animals treated with a prohibited medication may not be sold as organic. All organically raised animals mu st have access to the outdoors, including access 
to pasture for ruminants. They may be tem porarily confined only for reasons of health, 
safety, the animal's stage of producti on, or to protect soil or water quality. 
And here are some links to other sources  of organic information provided by the 
USDA: 
http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/Consumers/Links.html  
"Natural" does not mean the same thing as  "organic".  And because something is 
natural, such as natural herbs, does not mean it is necessarily safe. 
Tomatoes grown on commercial farms are grow n more for durability than taste.  They 
resist disease and ship well. 
89 A 1989 report to Congress from 14 scientific so cieties with total membership of more 
than 100,000 food scientists, microbiologists, toxicologists and veterinarians concluded 
that the major hazards in our food are not from  additives and pesticid e residues, but from 
disease causing microorganisms. 
Food becomes spoiled because of the presence of disease causing microorganisms 
living in the food and breaking down its stru cture.  Disease causing microorganisms can 
multiply in the time it takes to get the food fr om farm to market.  These microorganisms 
produce toxins like fungi, bacteria, and ot her organisms that cause food poisoning.  
Salmonella poisoning and botulism are examples .  Other microorganisms include bacteria, 
molds and viruses.  So it stands to reason th at we would have an i nborn inclination toward 
fresh food. 
A trusted friend once told me how he asked co-worker in health food store "What's the 
difference battalion organic and regular produce ?"  The produce man replied "Organic has 
less, not no, pesticides.  If you us e no pesticides the tree dies."   Another one said that non-
organic produce has pesticides, organic has worms.   
We have learned that preserva tives are not really as bad as  once thought -- in fact, they 
can be good for you, as they preserve you! 
Organic foods can maintain more disease cau sing organisms than foods that are not 
labeled organic.  I have at times been di sappointed by the quality of health food store 
produce, and have often found it starting to spo il.  I've noticed the containers of cut 
pineapple at one health food chain are a lot mo re expensive in contai n a lot more of the 
dense fibrous part of the pineapple than that found at a local supermarket. 
Disagreement between conventional food indus try "establishment" representatives and 
organic & health food industry representatives can be politic al and quite acrimonious.  I 
listened to them go at it on a recent radio talk show.  After all, there are huge amounts of 
money at stake.  Critics of the health food industry fire volleys by pointing out the dangers 
of bacterial infection, such as E coli 0157:H7, present in animal manure used to fertilize 
organic produce.  The health food people return fire  by talking about the use of raw sewage 
as fertilizer.  Cows that have dropped d ead, often for unknown reasons have been ground 
up and fed to living cows!  This practice of  bovine cannibalism has since been banned. 
Similarly, there is an ongoing de bate regarding pesticides.  Surely they would be toxic 
in high doses, but there is no evidence that pest icides cause bad health in the doses they are 
found in foods.  Environmental groups, health advocates and the hea lth food industry argue 
that most pesticides are dangerous and shoul d be banned.  On the other hand, in the United 
States pesticides are closely regulated, and when a hazard is demonstrated by scientific 
evidence the substance is banned.  But this is  often after it is proven to be dangerous. 
There is a broad range of herbicides, fungici des, rodenticides, avic ides, molluscicides.  
Bob Scowcroft of the Organic Farming Re search Foundation, a nonprofit organization, 
says "We are using three times the chemicals as we were 40 years ago to kill the same pests."    For protecting strawber ries, methyl bromide is injected into the soil, then a tarp is 
placed over it.  Monica Moore of  the Pesticide Action Network of North America says "It 
kills eveything from mammals to microbes.  It's a complete biocyde"   
An eye-opening article in Newsweek Mag azine written by Anne Underwood and Karen 
Springen reminds us that  these practices ma y not be poisoning our food, but there is no 
question it is killing off wildlife, endangeri ng farmworkers and degrading the soil and 
water that life depends on.  Pesticides now kinn 67 million American birds each year.  The Mississippi River dumps enough synthe tic fertilizer in the Gulf of Mexico to maintain an 
60-mile-wide "dead zone" too choked with algae to support fish.  The soil erosion threatens 
90 to turn much of the world's arable land into  desert.  The article quotes Fred Kirschenmann 
of the Leopold Center for Sustai nable Agriculture: "At some po int, the system s will start to 
break down." 
By far, the most common food additives are salt, sugar, corn syrup and other 
sweeteners.  Other potential contaminants include environmental pollutants like heavy metals, asbestos, PCBs, vinyl chloride and othe r industrial waste.  Al so, antibiotic residues, 
hormones and other substances may find their way into foods. 
Recently there has been a gr eat amount of concern over Mad Cow disease in Europe, 
accompanied by numerous beef recalls.  These diseases are brain deteriorating, fatal, and 
result in horrendous physical and emotional consequences.  They may take many years to 
manifest.  It has been said that the United States, with less than ideal beef inspection 
procedures, is poised for a similar outbreak.  Egad! What next?  Mad chicken disease? 
On a happy note, home grown vegetables ar e nutritious and delicious.  And you could 
avoid the pesticides.  It's easier than you might think, and it's fun. 
 
Vegetarianism 
There is no longevity advantage to being a ve getarian. It would be possible to have an 
antiaging diet with no meat, but would take mu ch more careful planning to get the proper 
amounts and balances of amino acids. And there is a more narrow margin of error for some 
other nutritional deficiencies. Strict vegetarians may not be  getting enough vitamin A in 
their diets if they're not careful about whic h vegetables they eat, suggests a National 
Institute of Medicine report.  Vitamin A deficiency affects about 100 million children 
worldwide and causes night blindness, skin dryness and more severe complications.   
Deficiencies of iron and zinc, wh ich are also plentiful in meat, are also to be considered.   
Vegetarians should also be caref ul to avoid deficiencies in iron, folic acid and vitamin B12. 
Vegetarians exclude all or some animal pr oducts. There are many variations.   A vegan 
diet consists of only foods of plant origin.   Lacto-vegetarian consists  of plant foods plus 
some or all dairy products.  Lacto-ovovegeta rian consists of plant foods, milk, dairy 
products and eggs.   A semi or partial vegeta rian doesn't eat red meat, but may eat chicken 
or fish with plant foods, dairy products, and eggs.  
An extreme variation is the fruitarian, wh ere any plant products except those parts of 
the plant that are cast off or dropped from the plant and that do not involve the destruction 
of the plant itself are avoided. 
 
Factory Farming and Animal Rights 
"The greatness of a nation and its moral progr ess can be judged by the way its animals 
are treated" 
- Mahatma Gandhi  
We may be torn between the need for 
protein and the awareness that farm animals are often jammed in confined cages, subjected to procedures such as debeaking, 
and often suffering painful deaths.  This is 
generally a part of what's known as "factory farming".  Eating animals who have had excessive antibiotics, as well have endured 
Photo from Farm Sanctuary 
91 stress and squalid conditions , is a not good for your health. 
 Here's what happens to a lot of animals: http://www.factoryfarming.com/gallery.htm  
Have you ever passed on eggs at 99 cents a dozen, in favor of "f ree range" at, say, 
$2.99 per dozen?  What "free rang e" really means is this: The USDA requests that the 
animals be allowed outdoor access for at leas t five minutes a day.  And the growers don't 
have to ensure the animal actually goes outside .   There are third party certifications that 
help ensure the animal was raised with ade quate space and without the use of hormones or 
unnecessary antibiotics ( but I've never seen any labeling of  this type).  Certified organic 
would be most comprehensive choice. 
Although we can sustain on a purely vegetabl e diet, for optimal existence we were 
created or developed to utilize protein from animal sources. 
As previously discussed in the section on or ganic foods, this page will tell you about 
the definition, standards and pr actices of USDA National Orga nic Program regulations:   
http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/FactSheets/ProdHandE.html  
Regarding animals, the livestock standards apply to animals used for meat, milk, eggs, 
and other animal products represented as  organically produced.   It says:  
Animals for slaughter must be raised under or ganic management from the last third of 
gestation, or no later than the second day of  life for poultry. Producers are required to feed 
livestock agricultural feed pr oducts that are 100 percent orga nic, but may also provide 
allowed vitamin and mineral supp lements. Producers may convert  an entire, distinct dairy 
herd to organic production by providing 80 pe rcent organically produced feed for 9 
months, followed by 3 months of 100 percen t organically produced feed. Organically 
raised animals may not be given hormones to  promote growth, or antibiotics for any 
reason. Preventive management practices, includi ng the use of vaccines, will be used to 
keep animals healthy. Producers are prohibited from withholding treatment from a sick or 
injured animal; however, animals treated with a prohibited medication may not be sold as organic. All organically raised animals mu st have access to the outdoors, including access 
to pasture for ruminants. They may be tem porarily confined only for reasons of health, 
safety, the animal's stage of producti on, or to protect soil or water quality. 
One of the points is to maintain anim al health without the use of drugs. 
"Access to outdoors" may not include "access to pastures." Under this scenario, dairy 
cows on dirt feedlots w ould considered organic. 
Robert Hadad, Director of Farming Systems Farm Animals & Sustainable Agriculture - 
The Humane Society of the United States offers  the definition of access to the outdoors for 
organically raised poultry.  He says it is we ll understood by organic fa rmers that this means 
a free-choice type of arrange ment for the birds. If the birds are housed in a permanent 
structure, they have sufficient openings to ve nture outdoors as they wish. Chickens aren't 
that stupid. If the weather is bad, they might not want to go out.  If the weather is decent for 
their comfort level, then they will  go outdoors as often as they wish. 
For a pastured system as used by Joel Salatin, who has been a huge family farm 
advocate, the pens he uses (and others have co pied) is movable. The chickens  have shelter 
but are also totally fenced in. the floor is open. The pens are moved daily to fresh pasture 
for the birds to scratch and peck as they wi sh. Food and water is also provided daily.  
92 The issue of outdoor access is getting muddl ed because 1) the USDA definition of free-
ranged is an actual label claim. The FSIS offi ce of USDA does not get very specific with 
how long a time period constitutes being outdoors in a free range system. Obviously, the vagueness of the regulations favors large corp orations who want la bel claims without 
actually doing what family farms do.  
There is a fight going on with  the National Organic Program  concerning outdoor access 
for organic poultry. Industry is trying to us e scare tactics to c onvince the NOP and USDA 
that having birds outdoors is a bad thing despit e the official rule that requires outdoor 
access. Companies really want to cheat on this because they cannot afford to set up a system where they have 10,000 - 100,000 birds ou tdoors and managed properly. They also 
do not want 100% organic feed regulations either.  All this  will cost them money. They 
want the organic premium but with out the expense of the practice.  
A brave coalition of agricultural and cons umer advocacy groups are working to 
maintain the organic integrity of the regulations  and actually make the rules stricter so that 
large companies can't cheat so easily.  
What the deal is now is that the NOP is sa ying they interpret the regulations as saying 
that due to weather or supposed  disease prevention that produ cers could keep their poultry 
indoors for some time period. This time period is not  clarified. Also, the issues of disease is 
unfounded. There is no scientific studies that  have shown poultry with outdoor access is 
any more likely to contract diseases than indoor birds. In fact the vast majority of disease 
outbreaks (Salmonella, Avian Influenza, and Ca mpylobacter) have all been in the huge 
confinement poultry operations. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~   
According to critics, producers sometimes look for loopholes in order to get a premium 
price for foods labeled organic.  "Access to out doors" may not include "access to pastures." 
Under this scenario, dairy cows on dirt  feedlots would considered organic. 
They also say there is no clear definition of  what constitutes "pasture" is offered, nor 
does the USDA delineate exact space or spac ing requirements for humane housing and 
outdoor access for poultry, pigs, cattle, and other animals. This proposed set of regulations, 
as currently written, actually a llows for animal factories. 
Other critics (mostly egg producers) comment that allowing chickens to roam free will 
result in outbreaks of salmonella enteritis and avian influenza, diseases  that affect humans, 
as well as birds. They say letting chickens  roam outdoors exposes them to rodents and 
predators, substantially increasing their chan ces of becoming sick and laying bad eggs.  
They also say that open access intended to create a natural environment, would instead 
create stress (which decreases egg production). 
Dr. Michael Appleby is vice pr esident of farm animals and sustainable agriculture for 
The Humane Society of the United States.  During a National Organic Standards Board 
volunteer board meeting in 2002 he said, "We ha ve helped to ensure that producers who 
want to call their poultry organic must allo w them outdoors."   He submitted written 
comments to the board, which were supplemen ted by direct testimony from Robert Hadad, 
director of farm systems for Humane Societ y.  They outlined some humane, as well as 
practical reasons for outdoor access:  
- To satisfy the birds' na tural behavior patterns  
- To provide adequate exercise area  - To strengthen bird health through reduc tion of stress and in creased immunity  
93 - To meet consumer expectations of organic livestock management 
But opponents say just the opposite -- they ar gue that only CONFINEMENT of animals 
could be considered "organic" and "human e." They also criticize the standards' 
inconvenience and lack of guarantees for healthy poultry.  North Carolina's state 
veterinarian, Dr. David Marshall said "While  noble in its intent, this concept [outdoor 
access] is ill conceived and not conducive to the mass rearing of poultry for human 
consumption"  
You can read all about it here: http://www.hsus.org/ace/14057  
 
Some controversy is generated as the USDA implements the National Organic 
Program.  In Massachusetts, a Massachusetts Independent Certification (MIC) ruling was 
overturned.  Late in 2002, Don Franczyk, cer tification coordinator for Massachusetts 
Independent Certification for the Northeast Organic Farmi ng Association (NOFA) said 
"The NOP made an arbitrary interpretation on an important issue, without any public 
comment, and now that interpretation has the fo rce of law. That's not how it is supposed to 
happen."   An article in the December-Ja nuary 2002-03 issue of the NOFA/Mass News 
states "But as it now stands, eggs and meat can be sold as organic even if the animals spend 
their lives essentially indoor s. The certifier must accept th e farmer's judgment; virtually 
any documentation will do to support when and how much access is granted."  And "Prices for conventional eggs (influenced by huge ope rations with caged bi rds) are notoriously 
low, so the incentive is strong to label e ggs as "organic" in order to get a price 
premium."Read all about it:

I wasn't sure what to call animals who have n't been mistreated. Diane Hatz of the Grace 
Factory Farm Project has been very kind a nd suggests we not use the term "organic" 
because that entails a lot of ot her things.  She suggests "sustainably-raised" or "sustainably-
produced" food.  (For meat, that's sustainably-raised". That means open range, no antibiotics, no hormones, humane conditions.  To  my thinking, "sustainably-raised" implies 
that it's better for the animals, good for you and me, as well as the environment.

Here's some information provided by Erica Li ss of the Humane Farming Association (Erica 
was very thoughtful in providing inform ation, which is much appreciated): 
To try to find items that are produced with both consumer health and animal welfare in 
mind, we recommend that you go to your local h ealth or natural food stores. You will find 
an extremely wide variety of meat substitutes and typically more information about all the 
products they carry. We also encourage our s upporters to visit their larger, mainstream 
grocery chains and request that factory-farm ed products be replaced with conscientious 
alternatives. We would caution you to be careful  in researching any products listed as "free range" and 
"humanely raised". We've had experiences in the past where members of ours have 
depended on lists claiming to be resources of  such products only to find that so-called 
"humane" farms have changed their policie s and practices by the time the list was 
published, leaving those holding it with inaccurate information. 
In addition, even when animals are raised wi th promises of humane or drug-free treatment, 
there are no controls or oversi ght that would ensure that they were not dismembered while 
fully conscious once they arrived at the slaughterhouse. 
Please also join HFA (www.hfa.org/member.html).  It is through your support that we are 
able to keep on the pressure and protect fa rm animals. Any support, in any amount, makes 
a difference.

And it is said that factory farming harms the environment.   http://www.factoryfarm.org/ reports-sustainability.html  
Are we out to earn our wings?  Maybe.  Partial solutions: 
1) Make the protein component of one or two of the "Real Food" meals each day a 
"complete vegetable protein", like rice & beans.  
95 2) Buy only eggs laid by uncaged, undrugged hens . As a rule of thumb, look in natural 
food stores for fertile brown eggs that st ate "no antibiotics" on  the carton. (but see 
Erica's comments above)  Hens allowed a h ealthful diet, fresh air, and exercise don't 
need antibiotics to survive.  
3) Tell your local restaurant owner that you won't eat veal there, inform him or here of the 
cruelty involved and that more customer s are becoming appalled by it, and would 
appreciate it if he or she would remove it from the menu. 
Here are a bunch of rice & beans recipes and books:

have protein-rich vegetable and synthetic design er foods tailored to your exact needs at that 
particular time.  Then a "farm" will be more like a petting zoo.  Until then, it's either eat once living things or eat dirt.   
Let's be kind to animals.  I'm going for some beans along with a little rice now. 
 
Seaweed? 
Even the best of soils are somewhat deplet ed of nutrients. Seaweed may have a some 
trace minerals that are unavailable in foods that are grown on land --  but unfortunately 
today this is a very good source of heavy metal contamination. 
 
Soy  
For a while I was drinking 2 cups of soy mil k, plus a variety of ot her soy foods like soy 
beans and tofu. Soy is one of the richest sources of plant estrogens.  My estradiol (a form of 
estrogen, a female hormone) rose to 135 pg/mL --  the reference range for men is less than 
55!  This is not a good thing, due to the femi nizing effects over time, among other reasons.  
So I discontinued all soy and on the ne xt test it was back to 49.   
Also, soy counters the effects of testoster one in men, thus incr easing body fat, reducing 
libido, erectile function and sex drive, a nd causes emotional swings. The September 2001 
issue of the Journal of Agri cultural and Food Chemistry repo rts that too much soy could 
lead to kidney stones -- and they are painful. 
Still, the American Heart Association (AHA) has given soy a blessing of for its 
cholesterol-lowering properties. Resear ch on cholesterol re duction has shown 
improvements with 30 or more than grams of  soy protein per day.  Although it may have 
good effects for the cardiovascular system, this is  not an example of a holistic approach.   
Soy is a polyunsaturated fat, so it is easily  oxidized (becomes rancid) and generates free 
radical damage.  Large amounts of soy inta ke have been associated with cancer 
96 Plant estrogens can lengthen a woman's menstr ual cycle by two or three days.  Over the 
course of a lifetime soy  can increase uter ine and breast cancer risk.  During menopause, 
with a woman's estrogen production is dec lining, soy may reduce hot flashes.   
Soy contains isoflavones, which are molecule s that mimic estrogen, a hormone that can 
increase a woman's risk of breast cancer. Genestein and daidzein are two of the 
isoflavones. 
The thinking goes that by getting false es trogen women can avoid the potential harm 
caused by the real thing. 
 
Isoflavones act like drugs, so we should view  them that way.   Because of the estrogen-
like content in soy, estrogen levels should  be monitored in both women and men. 
And there may be some other negatives to excess soy that we don't yet know about. 
Soy comes in many forms, and it is eaten by itsel f or used as a substitute for foods that 
are high in fat.  Soy beans are boiled, and the soy is a component of tofu and soy milk.  Soy 
comes in protein bars, but often contain exce ssive isoflavones (more than about 20-30 mg) 
and calories.  
Populations of people who consume a soy-rich  diet have documented reduced risks of 
some diseases.  For example, Japanese a nd Chinese people have lower rates of heart 
disease and breast and prostate cancer that  Americans.   But soy, like nutritional 
supplements, can be overdone.  Beware of soy pills and powders.  Many of these powders contain as much as 600-1000 mg.  Large amounts of soy intake have been associated with 
cancer. This is likely the result  of free radical effects.   
My hunch is that people taki ng a lot of lots of isoflavone supplements are also taking 
large amounts of other nutr itional supplements (like I was) to their detriment. 
Some experts recommend packing in as  much soy as you can eat. And some 
researchers are also increasingly finding a role  for estrogen in the brain, where on one hand 
it seems integral to nerve health. But ot hers are more cautious. A preliminary study 
published by Dr. Lon White et al, a brain expert at the Pacific Health Research Institute in 
Honolulu in the April 2000 in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition found that 
people who eat tofu twice a week or more may double the risk of suffering cognitive 
deficits in old age, also like ly the result of free radical effects.  While preliminary, the 
report shows soy isn't the answer to every disease.  The se researchers say chemicals in soy 
may interfere with the brain's ability to make  and keep nerve connections, which in turn 
could lead to both functional and physical brai n changes over time. But this finding is very 
preliminary and hasn't been replicated.  
 
Insulin 
Insulin is a protein hormone that is secreted  into the blood in response to a rise in blood 
glucose or amino acids.  Insulin does a numbe r of things, but primar ily, insulin binds to 
receptors on the cell's surface -- the cell then activates other receptors designed to absorb 
glucose.  Cells cannot utilize glucose without insulin. So you need glucose to live -- but 
here comes the bad news: glucose causes oxi dation damage within the body.  So excess 
glucose is real bad thing. 
Poor blood sugar and insulin control results in  the chemical combination of glucose and 
proteins in blood and tissues to produce dama ge proteins AGEs (adva nced glycosylated 
endproducts).  As AGEs accumulate in your body they interfere with mitochondrial 
function, thereby producing more oxidative stress.  
97 Insulin stability, i.e. the slow  and steady release of smaller amounts of insulin is better 
than large surges.  Too much insulin (that can be brought about by sugary calorie-rich 
foods) is a very bad thing.  Insu lin receptors become resistant to the stimulation of insulin 
over time, requiring much more insulin to ma ke them work.  So glucose is hanging around 
in the blood longer doing damage. By reducing the concentration of glucose in the blood, 
insulin reduces the long-term complications of  diabetes, including damage to the blood 
vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerv es, and insulin insensitivity can be partially reduced.  
Aging causes are relative and sensitivity to in sulin, requiring greater levels of insulin 
production.  Excess insulin productio n/released is a significant initiate or of inflammation 
of blood vessel lining.  It is an independent cardio vascular and stroke risk  factor.  It may be 
the underlying cause for atherosclerotic plaque formation.  The precision, scientifically 
designed nutrition, exercise, nut ritional supplement and other components of this system 
help reduce and prevent this. 
 
Fiber 
Let's talk about something good for a while: FIBER!  Most people think of oat bran 
when they hear of fiber.  Dietary fiber,  the kind found in plant foods, is of greater 
physiological importance than crude fiber.  Th is kind of fiber is found in whole grains, 
legumes fruits and vegetables.  Vegetable fi ber from vegetables like broccoli, brussels 
sprouts, cabbage and cauliflower is highly beneficial.  A good definition of fiber is 
anything that passes through our intestines undigested.  These are typically undigested 
complex carbohydrates.   
There are five different types of fiber, from soluble to insoluble.  Each has its own 
characteristics and effect on the body. 
Fiber does more than just scrape our intes tines.  Foods containing water-insoluble fiber 
bind with bile salts, thereby interfering with bile reabsorption and lowering cholesterol.  
Fiber modifies intestinal bacteria, and pr omotes weight loss.  Byproducts of fiber 
strengthen the lining of the intestine.  Some  of them are short-chain fatty acids (acids 
originating from hydrocarbons) and are better so urces of energy than glucose. People with 
a diet rich in fiber feel full,  so they tend to eat less volunt arily and weight  loss occurs.  
Pectin and guar gels from oats, beans and fr uits appear to alter the structure of the 
intestinal villi, thereby increasing pancreatic en zyme activity to help in the digestion of fats 
and vitamin B 12 metabolism.  And they lower choleste rol (par at ticularly LDL) and serum 
glucose, thereby reducing your insulin requirements. 
Start off with lower amounts of fiberous f oods, and increase over the course of a few 
weeks.  OK, so high fiber diets can have a few side effects including sensations of 
abdominal fullness, increased flatulence, mild  diarrhea, or even temporary constipation.  
These are temporary and would take anywhere  from a day or two to a few weeks to 
subside.  However, it may take as long as  six months to adjust  to high-fiber diet. 
High fiber diets of whole grains, form irreve rsible bonds with minera ls, interfering with 
mineral absorption throughout the intestinal tract.   Essential minerals like calcium, copper, 
iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc  have increased losses with high-fiber diets.  This is 
true to a lesser extent with ot her kinds of fiber. Minerals such  as above should be taken one 
hour before or three hours after ingesting in soluble fibers to reduce the risk of losing these 
minerals through fiber-mineral complexes. 
 
Sodium (Sodium Chloride, or Salt) 
98 A marketing consultant once told me there' s a saying in the snack food industry: "To 
make snack food taste better, just  add more sugar or salt."   
Sodium plays an essential ro le in the regulation of flui ds and blood pressure. It is 
chiefly obtained in sodium chloride, or comm on salt.    Also, baked goods contain sodium 
as the bi-carbonate. 
Although sodium is necessary in the diet. The National High Blood Pressure Education 
Programs (from the National Institute of Hea lth's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute) 
recommends a daily intake for everyone of no more than 2,400 mg of  sodium (the amount 
in 1-1/8 teaspoons of salt), and the American  Heart Association's recommendation for the 
general public is no more than 3,000 mg. Th e average amount consumed by Americans is 
4,000 mgs.  If no salt were added to food duri ng processing or cooking, there would still be 
an adequate amount of sodium in the diet.  
Other minerals, such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, also play a role in blood 
pressure regulation. 
Many studies in different populations have  shown that a high sodium intake is 
associated with higher blood pressure. Most re search suggests that many people at risk for 
high blood pressure can reduce their chances of  developing the conditi on by using less salt 
or sodium.  However, some other factors may in teract with sodium to affect blood pressure.  
Sodium and salt are mainly found in proce ssed and prepared foods .  Some people add 
salt and salty sauces (like soy sauce) to thei r food, but most dietary salt comes from foods 
to which salt has already been adde d during processing or  preparation.   
Take note of the sodium content of your condiments, particularly soy sauce, meat 
tenderizer, steak sauce, salsa and catsup.  Try using alternate seasonings , and a salt shaker 
with smaller holes. 
People aren't born with a taste for salt, it's acquired.   And it's a lo t like sugar -- getting 
used to using less salt results in a greater sensitivity in th e taste buds.  So a reduction in 
your intake of salt will result in a greater  enjoyment of very small amounts.    
    
Caffeine -- Coffee, Tea,  Cocoa, Nodoze etc. 
Some research shows that a cup or two of coffee a day can be good for you. 
Caffeine, found in coffee, tea, colas, choc olate and cocoa is a drug. Caffeine is the 
naturally occurring toxicant methylxanthine (x anthine, for short).  Related substances 
found in tea and cocoa are called theophylline an d theobromine.  Individual responses to 
caffeine vary, but people seem to fall into  two groups. For many people, small amounts 
increase alertness and larger am ounts result in nervousness.   
Caffeine inhibits the breakdown of cyclic  AMP and GMP (nucleotides that carry 
signals from the cell surface to proteins w ithin the cell).  Normally, AMP and GMP are 
rapidly broken down. They control metabolic pro cesses in the brain, nerves, heart, arteries, 
kidneys, stomach and intestines.  
More than two cups of coffee significantly affects the levels of total cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and blood levels  of epinephrine rise 147%. 
Coffee drinking has been associated with in creased serum cholesterol levels in some, 
but not all, studies.  
99 Coffee affects your hormones which in turn can affect your mood.  It 
alters insulin response, and makes the blood gl ucose levels more unstable for a few hours.  
Some people report increased desire for carbohydrat es later because blood sugar decreases.   
There is some evidence it may reduce the risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. Caffeine stimulates the heart muscle and dilates coronary arteries.  In contrast to their 
dilating effect on other blood vessels, xanthine s constrict the blood ve ssels of the brain, 
reducing cerebral blood flow – that’s why they relieve some types of headaches.  Caffeine 
also stimulates gastric acid and other gastric secretions.  It ta ns your intestines.  What could 
be worse?  It alters moods, sleep patterns , behavior, cognition, psychomotor coordination 
and the quality of sleep. 
All xanthines act on the kidne y to increase urinat ion, which limits their usefulness in 
fulfilling the body’s fluid needs.  So all that coffee doesn’t count as water. 
Here’s the good news: caffeine can improve athletic endurance!   
More bad news: People suffer from caffeine w ithdrawal headaches after about 12 to 18 
hours, and these caffeine withdrawal head aches may persist for several weeks. 
More good news for tea drinkers: Green tea contains polyphenols, alleged to do a host 
of wonderful things, like prev ent cancer, protect the heart fr om athersclerosis, improve 
HDL/LDL ratios, exhibit antioxidant properties,  decrease hypertension, is an antibacterial 
for cholera and typhus, and is antiviral for influen za.  But wait, there’s more: It is alleged to 
decrease tooth decay.  Green tea does contain ca ffeine, but it is reported to not cause people 
to become as jittery as coffee. 
Researchers found that drinking 350mg of caf feine can cause lapses in concentration 
and increased stress, according to a survey s ponsored by Volvic mineral water.  This may 
be partly to blame for office workers' poor  performance. The av erage cup of coffee 
contains about 100mg of caffeine.  Of 1,000 of fice workers surveyed, 76% said they drank 
tea, coffee or caffeinated cola more than th ree times during the work ing day, with one in 20 
consuming more than 10 drinks.  Stress spec ialist Dr David Lewi s, who analyzed the 
research for Volvic, is calling for traditional mo rning and afternoon breaks to be scrapped.   
He said: "Our clinical research found that a high caffeine intake (more than 350mg during 
the working day) acts as a powerful diuretic  and causes people to visit the toilet more 
frequently, which can lead to performance-zapping dehydration.  
"This, coupled with the powerful stimulating e ffects of caffeine, increases stress and causes 
failures in concentration."   Sarah Schenker, a dietician for the British Nutrition Foundation, said there was nothing wrong with peopl e drinking three or four cups of coffee 
a day - provided that they also drank water or  other decaffeinated drinks to compensate.  
She said: "If you only drink caffeinated drinks  then you will become mildly dehydrated. It 
has been shown that just 2% dehydration doe s affect concentration, and also makes you 
irritable."  
Having devoted all this ink to the subject, you might think I’m down on the bean.  
Well, here's a reversal -- A new study of 8,004 Japanese-American men in Hawaii suggests 
that coffee may prevent Parkinson's disease. Researchers said the benefits were probably 
linked to caffeine, and they say apparently the more, the better.  They suggested some 
theories about how it might work.  
But some people tend to just become more al ert, and others become more anxious when 
under the Starbucks spell  [??? Can I say that?] .  The anxiety prone people display increased 
irritability and agitation, and insomnia, and in more extreme cases, tremor, palpitation and 
nausea.   
100 Personally, I have found that a little coff ee (about 6 oz.) makes me perky, and a lot 
makes me jumpy.  Most hardcore coffeeholics would do a lot better, and feel better, on 
less.  It’s one of my few vices  these days, although I have cu t down from about 3 to 6 cups 
per day to maybe 1-1/2, and often substitute green tea.  So all things in moderation – including caffeine. 
 
Alcoholic Beverages 
The alcohol equivalent of one to two glasse s of wine each day have may be beneficial 
to one’s heart.  Red is preferred to white.  Of course, more alcohol does not mean even 
longer life. Studies show dri nking more than one or two drinks per day can raise blood 
pressure, and can cause fetal alcohol syndrom e, stroke, irregular heartbeat and sudden 
death. 
All this doesn’t necessarily mean that if a tea totaler starts drinking, that they will live 
longer.  It just may mean that there is something else that re sults in an inclination to live 
long as well as have a drink.  Correlation does not necessarily mean a causal relationship.   
On the other hand, the relaxation and stress reduction can  be beneficial. 
The publication Wine Spectator is pleased to report that Danish researchers have found 
wine drinkers to have a lower risk of deat h from heart disease a nd cancer than people who 
consume only beer and spirits.  Wine consumpti on appeared to be related to a reduction in 
death from both coronary heart disease and cancer, wrote the researchers, who theorized 
that "wine may contain one or se veral substances that add to th e beneficial effect of intake 
of a small amount of ethanol."  
Needless to say, but I’ll to say it anyway: 
Don’t drink and drive – or operate heavy machinery, or drink and do anything else 
that requires your full concentration and mental  faculties.  What’s more, if you start 
making speeches when you' re drunk you’ll make the best  speech you’ll ever regret! 
 
Caloric Restriction  
Caloric restriction (CR) is a reduction of calories in a diet, while maintaining a very 
high nutritional value in the food that is cons umed.  It is often cal led undernutrition without 
malnutrition.   At this time, it is the onl y proven life extension method -- in laboratory 
animals anyway.  It has been shown to extend the lives of a wide range of animals, from 
worms to fruit flies to mice, and probably monk eys.  These effects are dramatic if initiated 
early (30 to 40 percent if init iated in early adulthood) and ha ve significant effects even if 
implemented by middle-age.  
First we'll talk about the experimental resu lts in laboratory animals.  If you're not a 
laboratory animal, you may be intere sted in the section on humans. 
Most of the CR research has been done on an imals, such as nemotodes, fruit flies and 
rats, and research is currently being conducte d on monkeys. CR animals have a significant 
reduction in the ailments of aging, such as ca rdiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer.  
Rats continued to master mazes  long after rats on a typical di et stopped learning.  But this 
effect has often not been the case in monkeys.  Also, studies suggest that CR results in a 
reduced ability to withstand stress, such as  injury, infection or  exposure to extreme 
temperatures, as well as increase d incidence of osteoporosis.   
One likely explanation for caloric  restriction's role in the prevention of aging is that 
lowered caloric intake results in lowered meta bolic rate, and therefore a lowered rate of 
oxygen consumption and damage due to oxidative stress.  Metabolism is the process by 
101 which foods are transformed into basic elem ents which can be utilized by the body for 
energy or growth.  Species with low metabolis ms tend to live longer, and vice versa.  The 
process of metabolism generates free radicals , and metabolism determines intracellular 
enzymatic activity.  So less free radicals are ge nerated, and they are better disposed of.  
Glucose causes oxidation within  the body, and caloric restrict ion forces the body to use 
glucose more efficiently.  
It has been theorized that the reason caloric  restriction works in rodents is because it 
lowers their body's temperature set point, resul ting in less free radical production.  But we 
humans maintain our temperature. 
Recent evidence shows that CR increases th e available amounts of the substance 
called nicotinamide adenine dinuc leotide (NAD), which plays an important role in cellular 
energy production through th e breakdown of glucose.  Abundant NAD increases the 
effectiveness of the protein Sir2p, which prev ents, or "silences" the expression of certain 
genes that are believed to be responsible fo r DNA damage.   In an article in Science 
magazine Dr. Leonard Guarente and associ ates have identified a cellular metabolic 
pathway underlying this.  This pathway is a su itable target for a new drug to mimic the 
effects of caloric restriction.   
Some of the most exciting research to  date has been performed by Dr. Richard 
Weindruch and Dr. Tomas Prolla of the Univ ersity of Wisconsin. Genetic analysis of 
caloric restricted mice has shown that thei r DNA remains in a more youthful condition.  
And although muscle and organ mass is decr eased, the mice remain active, and maintain 
brain mass until later years. The incidences of degenerative diseases decrease. The effects on humans appear to be remarkably simila r in many respects. And have demonstrated 
results like lowered leukocytes, uric acid a nd LDL cholesterol, and higher HDL cholesterol 
with caloric restriction. And it is  effective even is begun in mi d-life. Caloric restriction has 
also been shown to improve physiological m easures of health, like basal glucose and 
insulin sensitivity in monkeys.  
 
Great!  But What About Us Humans 
But aggressive CR has not been proven to extend the lifespan of humans.  Not that 
many people have been practicing aggressive calo ric restriction to have the data necessary 
to prove its effectivenes s and safety in humans. 
Most of the research on food re striction on humans is related to  obesity and weight loss.  
In this group caloric restriction has been shown to lower blood pressure, produce the level 
of blood lipids, increased the ratio of benefici al HDL cholesterol, improve insulin responds 
in the control of blood glucose level and diabe tics, decrease frequenc y of angina (pain in 
the chest, sometimes radiating to the left arm,  caused by a spasm of the coronary artery of 
the heart), and claudication (cramplike pains in the legs due to insuffi cient arterial blood 
supply to the muscles seen in association with hardening of the arteries of the legs).  It 
reduced abnormalities of cardiac rhythm revealed by electroencephalogram.  It also improved memory, alertness, and other complex mental functions, as we ll as retarding the 
onset of mental decline. 
The research in animals and obese humans  offers strong argu ments that an ongoing 
low-calorie diet will improve he alth and extend the life span.  We have certainly seen the 
detrimental effect s of overeating. 
There are problems when applying the result s of animal research to humans.  One 
major consideration is that we just don't know the long-term effects of  caloric restriction on 
humans -- particularly upon th e brain and mental function. 
102 Aggressive caloric restric tion for a human is something in the neighborhood of 1300-
1800 calories per day.  The irony is that many people, practicing poor dietary habits, are 
getting less nutrition of a CR program, but with a whole lot more sugar and fat!  
A typical caloric re stricted intake for a 150 pound pe rson would be about 1400 calories 
per day.  This is very difficult for most peopl e.  However, with the right motivation and by 
practicing methods like those in the Behavi or Modification and Motivation section, and 
self-hypnosis and neurolinguistic  programming, it could be much easier.  When testing a 
diet that was around 1900 calorie s, I actually experienced a good feeling of reassurance 
from the empty, kind of hungry feeling. 
The mice on caloric restricted diets not only become very mean, but they often kill and 
eat each other.  Videos of the mice show th em to be as active as young mice, long into the 
evening.  But I don't know, maybe they're just se arching their cages for a morsel of food.  
And maybe it's my imagination, but I thought I heard one of them say  "Hey! Ya got any 
food?  I'm hungry here!  Just a scrap of rat chow or some  lettuce?  Anything will do." 
There is a narrow margin of error in being assured of proper nutri tion when drastically 
reducing food intake. Obviously, people who eat so little become very thin. Different 
people have different caloric needs, and nut ritional supplementation is a given. A human 
must restrict calories slowly, and will abso lutely need qualified medical supervision. 
There's uncertainty about the effects CR might  have on osteoporosis in later years.  
This is particularly important for women, as well as the fact that it is entirely inappropriate during pregnancy.  
Caloric restricted mice maintained brain mass until later years.  But people are not 
mice.   Our brains and nervous systems are a great deal more complex than those of mice, 
giving rise to things like language, higher judgment, creat ivity and much much more. 
Convincing evidence that humans will not lose  brain tissue and neurological and other 
function with a serious caloric restri cted diet does not yet exist.   
And everyone's different.   We each have a different genetic makeup, and a CR diet that 
works for one person may be disastrous for another. 
I personally speak from the experience of once having blindly followed a very 
aggressive program based upon incomplete evid ence and doing myself a lot of harm.  The 
system outlined in this manual is a reduced ca loric restriction program , but with important 
exercise, nutrient and other components that are in balance with its nutritional component.  
Your exercise would need to be reduced along with the reduced calories.  But it is possibly 
your mental abilities would also be reduced for you. 
Still, some people practicing aggressive calori c restriction say that it's not all that bad 
once you get used to it.  It has even been described as fulfilling, and some medical measurements have been desc ribed as "phenomenal".   
Looking up the keywords "caloric restrict ion" in a web search engine (I use 
www.google.com  and the multi-engine system at www.dogpile.com ) will reveal a lot of 
papers, resources and "how to" discussions. 
At around 2250 calories per day, the nutrition system outlined in this manual is a 
modified caloric restriction program, and is  balanced with the exercise, nutritional 
supplementation and quality of life issues.   
Although I don’t recommend CR just yet, I le ave it to you whether to really take the 
plunge and severely restrict ca lories.  I would hope to compar e notes in with you to about a 
hundred years. 
103 By the way, it is difficult to tell whether the CR monkeys are happy. 
 
Healthy Eating at Restaurants 
This is a tough one, as it can be difficult or dering healthful foods at  restaurants.  Most 
restaurant food has a lo t of hidden fats.  Polyunsaturated fats are cheap, and people seem to 
like the taste, so they find their way into rest aurant foods.  No, fat doesn't really "find its 
way" anywhere, they are placed there.  Chic ken is one of our favorite protein foods, but 
restaurant chickens, particularly  those from fast-food restaurants, are ofte n fatty birds.   
Pressed meat contains various fillers, byproducts, fat, and I suspect, the beaks and 
talons.  I can't tell you how many times I as ked the counter person at a sandwich shop 
whether the turkey breast was re al or pressed meat, and was told it was definitely real 
turkey breast -- only to find that it was pressed meat with the sandwich came.   
Here lowdown on some t ypical restaurant items: 
 Caesar Salad -- 38 grams of fat, 505 calories Ach!  
  Pasta Salad -- 28 grams fat, 450 calories  Ohmygosh!  
(not enough protein in the above salads for a meal, maybe 0-10 grams depending on 
how much meat, if any, is included) 
 Cappuccino -- 9 grams fat, 160 calories  Egad!  
 Mayonnaise 11 grams of fat and 100 calories per tablespoon, and thousand island salad 
dressing 5-6 grams fat and ar ound 50 calories per tablespoon. Oink!  
So specifying no mayo or salad dressing will go long way to reduce the 
unhealthiness of your food. 
 The "Big Mac" -- 32 grams fat, 570 calories.  But at least you're getting 26 grams of 
protein.  McZowee!  
 Chicken or other meat pot pi es, fast food taco salad and tuna sandwiches are more of 
the kinds of fat-laden foods to be greeted with an " Ugh! " and crossed off your list.   
 Precision nutrition must be ongoing.  After bei ng on this system a couple of months and 
experiencing the benefits, particularly more energy and clarity of mi nd, I got disorganized 
and lazy. A real backslider.  I started thi nking it would be just OK have a few yucky ice 
cream sundaes each week as well as a few junk food treats every day, fall back into a work 
life of great stress, and skip working out and still feel fully  energized and alive.  And I 
stopped drinking enough water.  WRONG!  It doesn’t work that way.   
I also wasn’t feeling as fulfilled or as ha ppy as at first when closely adhering to the 
system.  So I went back and took a look at  the details that had brought these negative 
changes.  After 3 times through this routin e I FINALLY GOT IT!   And like me, you will 
figure out that remaining disorganized in your  eating habits, not taking the time to prepare 
or take the right kinds of foods to work with you, just eating whatever, and whenever, 
JUST ISN’T WORTH IT!   You'll get th e results you want if you keep it up! 
 
Now Take Some Action! 
Expect to just lose your in terest in harmful "foods".  And when that happens, you'll 
know you've arrived. 
Now on to the next part for some beha vior modification and motivation . . . 
 
104 Chapter 4  -- Behavior Modification and Motivation 
 
"Motivation is what gets you started.  Habit is what keeps you going."  
Unknown 
The one overriding requirement for using these is that you have to want to.   Still, there 
are some methods you can use to implement this system and turn the ap plication of  it into 
habit. As evidenced by your reading up to this point, you're al ready rolling. With 
motivation, one could fly through the rest of th e pages, implementing the system and on to 
youthful, joyous living for years, de cades, maybe even centuries.  
I placed this section here because you may need some methods to make the nutritional 
guidelines, as well as the other id eas that follow, a little easier. 
And even the most motivated of us could use a boost sometime -- myself included.  The 
good news is that you can do a lot to more easily ma ke this system a habit.  Why?  So that 
you will take action, and follow this system for 6 weeks.  After that, when you experience 
the youthful and joyous living, you are sure to continue. 
It's been said that it takes 21 days to change a habit.  But it may take as long as several 
months or longer for you to change your lifel ong eating habits.   Ever y day you exercise is 
a big win. Each time you just say no to junk food is  a score.   It all adds up, at the end the 
results are lifelong, positive changes.  The payof f  will be that you w ill get what your want 
out of life. 
You must be committed and follow this system even when it is inconvenient. You are 
in control -- you can influence th e events in your life.  Maintain an attitude of curiosity and 
responsibility. Provoke questions, explore, take responsibility,  maintain control and learn 
new attitudes, and look at things as an inte resting challenge. And s eek to transform your 
life. 
 
Medical Details -- and Follow Your Doctor's Guidance  
Review the "friendly" disclaimer at the st art of the manual. Have a complete physical 
exam (which is probably long overdue anyw ay) and get your doctors approval before 
implementing any of the ideas in this manual. 
 
If You Have a Medical Condition 
As with nutrition, if you have a medical cond ition, that changes things. The information 
below would need to be modified  to meet your special needs. 
 
Some Behavior Modification and Motivation Methods  
With the methods that follow will help you ope rate your brain. Although we have what I’ll 
call our “higher self”, so me parts of the brain act pretty much automatically.  Some are in 
the form of reflexes, and others are learne d ways of behaving.  There are ways you can 
operate these automatic systems, much like flipping a light switch or driving a car.  
 
What do you want?  A good first step is to decide exactly  what it is that you want.  Write 
down your goals and include timeframes. 
Once an hour, every hour    Whatever it is you want in life, write it down on a piece of 
paper once each hour.  Then look at it, and read  what you've read.  It doesn't have to be 
105 legible, a scrawl will do. You'll impress your br ain within instruction in three ways -- 
visually (by reading), through sound (by sayi ng, even if it is to  yourself) and through 
motion (by writing). If there’s just no pen and paper  around, write it in th e air with your 
finger. If someone asks what the heck you' re doing, just tell them you're conducting the 
Philharmonic next Saturday and need to rehearse. 
Make your statements in the positive, and complete with an action statement. For 
example: “The desire for unhealthy foods is gone gone gone.  It is replaced with only the 
desire for healthful and nourishing low-calorie an d low-fat foods according to this system.”   
Do not confuse your mind with negatives or double negatives, like “I don’t like 
unhealthy foods”.   
For whatever reason you undertake this system , whether to make the fat go away, or to 
have an improved and younger appearance, or to make your energy rebound, the result will 
be yours. 
And remember, you can format this to work with anything you want.  Scott Adams, the 
artist who draws the "Dilbe rt" cartoons used this met hod by writing down "Dilbert will 
become the most widely read cartoon in Amer ica."  Sure enough, slowly at first then ever 
increasing, his readership widened and he accomplished exactly that. 
Obviously, if you are driving a car, in a mee ting, or flying an airplane, it'll wait -- but 
hopefully not for too long.  If not, then please do this right now. 
There is a mysterious connection between impressing in your brai n in this way, and 
what comes into (or exits from) you life.  Perhap s that connection is my stical or spiritual.  
Or maybe your mind is working in the backgr ound and you just put plans into action or 
become more tuned in to acting on the opportuni ties that are continually coming our way,  
often without our noticing.   
You may be amazed at how this works!  The br ain is smart.  It'll find a way to make it 
happen.   
After the change in habit has been put into  place, you may want to only do this a few 
times a day or once in the morning instead of every hour.  But it's one of those things it's 
easy to forget -- so don't forget.  
 
Meditate On How Great Your Life Can Be 
You'll learn more about meditation in a la ter chapter.  But for the purpose of 
motivation, as you meditate envision your beha viors and body changing.  Old habits float 
or drain away, while the golden light of your new habits fill and warm you.   You see your 
body changing -- becoming leaner and stronger, while your mind becomes ever clearer and 
filled with joy.  
 
Ask Yourself Enabling and Empowering Questions 
Asking yourself enabling and empowering ques tions will redirect  your mental focus 
and state of mind, thereby changing how you feel  and the inner workings of your brain and 
mind.   
What you ask depends on your unique goals a nd needs.  The questions are usually in 
the format "What would life be like if . . . "  or "How would I feel if . . . ", or "What will I do when . . . ?" and so forth.    
For example, if you want to make life-ch anging improvements but are having difficulty 
getting started (when you experience the great positive effects and it becomes a habit it will 
106 be really easy), ask yourself "How will I feel when I am eating right, exercising properly, 
and thinking clearly?" 
If you have been living in stress, you might ask yourself "What woul d life be like if I 
were totally stress-free?"  Or if you have a f ear of heights, you might ask " What things 
will I do when I am free of this feat of heights and be comfortable and joyful in high places?" 
Your mind will find ways to turn your questions into reality. 
 
Big Bang 
Envision what you would like to change on your mental screen.  This could be your self 
as overweight, or slothing on the couch like a couch potato, or not being able to face a particular situation, anything you just don't want .  Make it as vivid as possible -- see the 
colors, hear the sounds, smell the smells, imagine how it feels.  Now imagine how you 
would like things to be in mi niature at a corner of your mental screen.  Imagine the 
miniature growing, swirling, making a sound lik e a jet engine and swooping up and around 
and smashing into the larger vision that you no longer desire.  Imagine a big swooshing 
sound as it moves to demolish the thing you wa nt changed with a big bang.  Make new 
image as vivid as the first one was.   
The brain/mind knows what to do to make this  happen.  It's working in the background 
to change habits and become receptive to oppor tunities, and will do what it takes to bring 
the change you want into reality.   
After you find the change coming about you can do the Big Bang less frequently.  
 
Double Ben Franklin 
What's better than a hundred dollar bill?  Two hundred dollar bills.  Although this ain't 
that, it could help you make a whole lot of hundred  dollar bills.  Ben Fr anklin is attributed 
with coming up with the method of making a list  of "reasons for" and "reasons against" a 
certain course of action in order to bring th e light important information and help make a 
decision.  (Or when comparing two possible courses of action you ca n assign a value to 
each reason and add up the totals and compare in order to find which one would be better).   
This carries it a step further in order to mo tivate and change behavior.  Take a piece of 
paper.  On the top left, write a brief headi ng describing the way thi ngs are not or what you 
are doing now.  It could be something like "E ating Unhealthy Foods" or "No Exercise" or 
the like.  Near the middle of the page on th e left write another heading, something like 
"Healthful Eating" or "Exercise".  Under each of these headings make two columns with the sub headings "What I'm Gaining" and "Wha t I'm Losing".  Now fill each of your four 
columns.  You should be a write down at least 3 things in each column. Perhaps a few more ice cream sundaes and nights “relaxing” in front of the TV (I don’t know about you, but I 
don’t feel all that refreshed after an evening of  vegging out in front of the tube).  Take your 
time, and find a whole lot of reasons.  You w ill accomplish two things with this: 1) You 
will find lots of reasons for making a pos itive change, and 2) you will impress these 
reasons upon your mind. Review this several time s a day. The brain is smart.  It'll make it 
happen.   
Go back and read the very start of this manual if you need a few ideas.  Come on, work 
with me on this.  ] 
107 Puhleez, just do the "Once an Hour", "Big Bang"  [???and"Double Ben 
Franklin"] now. Write these things down on  a piece of paper right and do the exercise 
now.  
Go ahead, I’ll wait . . .  
 
OK.  Although sometimes it takes a while for it to sink in, you will soon begin 
experiencing a thing called more  
MOTIVATION!   
By your own choice and design, you are making it much easier to follow this system 
for the 6 weeks I talked about on the first pa ge.  You're really starting to pull your own 
strings now. 
 
Snap Goes the Rubber Band (OW!) 
Put the rubber band of around your wrist, and gi ve yourself a stingy li ttle snap.  Hertz, 
donut? (hurts, don't it?)  :0)   Now do this wh en you start to think about unhealthy food, 
when you begin to flop on the couch while fore going your exercise, or when starting to do 
something by habit that needs to be changed. This will rewire your brain to connect the 
unhealthy effects of "the bad thi ng" with something irritating a nd help you break the habit.   
Just one more thing – right now sit or sta nd up straight and take a deep breath.  Now 
move your body with a sense of energy, and the way you would when you are feeling a 
sense of strength and control.  This will energize you to take action. 
Meditate, Affirm and "Program" Yourself   Go to a place where you wi ll not be disturbed, 
deeply relax and breathe deep from the di aphragm.  Just repeat the positive action 
statements like in the "O nce an Hour" section above. 
 
Expect the Best   When you expect a positive outcome, motiva tion increases.   Expect to get 
tremendous rewards from this system. It's true.  
 
Trying TOO Hard?  Some goals are driven by the "ego".  You'll learn more about your ego 
and how it can undermine your true happiness in chapter 6.  Regarding changes, sometimes 
the harder you fight it, the mo re power you give the ego and the more difficult it becomes.  
So sometimes the best course of action can be to just relax and not take it too seriously.

Dana working her biceps Chapter 5  -- Exercise  
There is no wealth but life   
     John Ruskin, 'Unto This Last' 
Vigorous exercise can help keep you younger longer -- and 
help prevent disease.   
Here's the short list of what th e exercise system that follows 
can do for you:  Increase lean body mass, promote 
cardiovascular fitness. It stimul ates the repair and growth of 
your body, builds muscle tissue, increases bone  density, increases the hormone production 
and balances hormones (increases HGH, testoste rone, estrogen, and reduces cortisol).  As 
previously discussed, a hormone is a kind of ch emical produced by a gland that is secreted 
into the bloodstream and contro ls the function of di stant cells or organs.  Proper hormone 
levels help reduce fat and build muscle a nd other lean body mass, gives you energy, builds 
your immune system, stimulates the repair of your body, reduces cholesterol and even 
makes you sexier. 
The more lean body mass (muscle) we have, th e greater the number of calories we will 
burn throughout the day. We can improve our body composition through exercise (both 
resistance training and aerobic exercise), which can dramatica lly increase our daily energy 
expenditure and burn off excess energy stores (fat). This happens while we are exercising 
and, if the exercise is intense, as the day goes on we continue to burn extra calories.  
Exercise will replenish and restore vascular endothelium and raises endorphin levels 
(endorphins are those brain chemi cals that make you happy).  It increases your cells' insulin 
sensitivity, raises basal metabolic rate, incr eases stress adaptogens , improves respiratory 
function, enhances immune responses.  It increases neuromuscular coordination and 
promotes enhanced mental function, reduces cholesterol & triglycer ides, increases HDL 2b 
(reverse cholesterol transfer).  It'll even make you sexier (did I say that yet?). 
When combined with practicing good posture, well-conditioned muscles will bring 
your body into proper alignment thereby prev enting joint grinding and wear.  Strong 
muscles and flexibility also re sult in less load on th e joints.  The increased blood pressure 
and circulation resulting from exercise will stimulate the growth of micro-capillaries 
throughout your body, resulting in th e better nutrient to flow to  your cells and better waste 
elimination.  Exercise improves glucose metabol ism and insulin sensitivity to assure that 
your cells have the proper amounts of fuel at the right times, and reduces cholesterol 
thereby reducing the risk  of heart disease and stroke.  It  can even improve your mood and 
stimulate the growth of brain cells in certain parts of your brain! And exercise lowers your 
appetite set point -- so you'll be less hungry.  Did I mention that exercise will even make 
you sexier? 
Of course exercise is good for people of a ll ages. But according to an Ohio University 
study men over 60 can become 80 percent stronger  if they start doing hi gh-intensity weight 
training. And seniors can gain stre ngth at the same rate as  
men in their 20s. The subjects were all healt hy but had never weight trained before also 
showed marked improvements in  their aerobic capacity.   
Robert Staron, an associate professor of anatomy at th e university's College of 
Osteopathic Medicine explains : "Elderly individuals are ve ry capable of responding to 
exercise and maintaining streng th," says Staron, who co-autho red the study that appeared 
in the Journal of Gerontology .  
109 Mitochondria were discussed in the "Why We Age" sec tion.  They are the energy 
power plants of your body.  There is recent ev idence that the demand exercise places upon 
the mitochondria causes them to multiply.  The result is more energy production, hence, 
feeling better and more energetic, and even a clearer mind.  
Studies with isolated mitochondria have  indicated that during normal cellular 
respiration (which differs from  "breathing" respiration) ther e is leakage of reactive oxygen 
species from the electron transport chain, re sulting in the produc tion of superoxide, 
hydrogen peroxide, and the form ation of tyrosyl radicals. 
There are downsides to just about everything, even breath ing which causes the release 
of free radicals. Vigorous exercise dramatically  increases cardiac outpu t to supply skeletal 
and cardiac muscle mitochondria with increase d oxygen. It has been determined that the 
increase in oxygen flow in cardiac muscle is 10-fold, and the increase in skeletal 
mitochondria is approximately 100- fold.  Th is possibly overwhelms antioxidant defenses. 
Therefore, the increase in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism induced by exercise may 
result in an increase in oxidative stress and increase protein oxidation.  So taking some 
antioxidants within a couple of hours before ex ercise, and some Acet yl L-Carnitine just 
before exercise is important because it is beli eved that extracellular saturation of vitamin 
dependent antioxidant enzyme systems is vital to protect cellular walls from oxidative stress injury and prevent a cascade of free radical pr oduction from oxidation of 
polyunsaturated fats in the lipid bilayer cytoskeleton, a 
layer of cellular membranes. 
Several investigators have postulated that contracting 
skeletal muscle is under exerci se-induced oxidative stress. 
In addition, they found that aged  animals are susceptible to 
exercise-induced oxidative damage. Moreover, 
investigators have found disr uption of mitochondrial form 
in electron microscopic studies  of heart tissue from acutely exercised rats. This altered 
mitochondrial form in the exercised animals was temporary and was not visible 24 hours 
after acute exercise.  
Good news for whoopee makin' -- acco rding to a study published in the Journal 
Urology , men who walked briskly for two miles a day were less likely to suffer from 
erectile dysfunction than  their more sedentary counterpart s. What's more, men who hadn't 
been active when they were younger but starte d a regular exercise regimen in middle age 
were able to cut their risk for the disorder.  If the risk of erectile dysfunction doesn't send 
you running to the gym, consider ulcers.  Now researchers who have studied 8,500 men 
over two decades report that those who ran or  walked at least 10 miles a week were 62 
percent less likely to develop duodenal ulcers than those who did not exercise regularly.  
The list of benefits goes on and on and on a nd on.  But too much exercise, or the wrong 
kinds of exercise do you damage.  This could include joint and cartila ge degeneration, and 
excessive free radical production resulti ng in DNA damage.  And proper nutrient 
supplementation, like antioxida nts and protein, should be us ed along with exercise.

If You Have a Medical Condition 
As with nutrition, if you have a medical condition, that may change things.  The 
system below may need to be modi fied to meet your special needs. 
The exercises below were designed for h ealthy adults who are free from medical 
conditions that would limit their activity or require special consid eration.  People with 
medical conditions require a program designed for them by a Consult a physician or other 
expert who is experienced in exercise trai ning.  These special programs are usually of 
moderate intensity, at most.  And ea ch group has its own contraindications. 
These medical conditions include, but are no t limited to: advanced age, arthritis, 
asthma, cancer, cardiac rehab, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, end 
stage renal disease, hyperlipidemia (elevate d blood fats), obesit y, pregnancy, nursing 
mothers, young people, to name a few. 
For example, arthritics may be placed on a program where they exercise two or more 
times a day, and in water for resistance b ecause it is easier on the joints.  Most 
hypertensives would not engage in resistance training until th eir blood pressure is under 
control.  Diabetics usually benefit from moderate  to low impact aerobics (like walking) that 
progress in time and intensity, as well as mode rate to low weight tr aining.  Many diabetics 
have serious cardiovascular pr oblems that could make sudden, intensive exercise a very 
bad idea. Diabetics’ blood glucose should be mo nitored and no exercise if glucose is out of 
range until food or glucose is administered, or  there are blisters on the hands or feet, 
cardiac problems or high lipid levels.

______________________________ 
Important Note: Start off Sloooooow  
If you haven’t been exercising for a while, star t off with easy exercise and increase the 
intensity and duration at a pace you are comforta ble with.  Ramp up slowly.  It will take 
you at least three months to get in shape.   Your tendons will be strengthened, blood 
composition will improve, and the infrastructure  in your body will develop and progress to 
support high-intensity wo rkouts and better health. 
______________________________ 
Another Important Note: Do not become injured.  
If you feel a muscle pull or an unusual pain, or  feel faint or dizzy, just stop!  If you are 
lifting weights and feel a muscle pull, do not even try to finish the set! An injury will really 
set you back.  And besides, it hurts! 
______________________________ 
 
Nope, Not the last -- Just One More Important Note: 
Overtraining can be damaging.  People tr aining beyond their metabolic capability can 
sustain tissue damage, protein deficiency, hormone imbalances, an impaired immune 
system and depression. 
______________________________ 
 
Stay away from all herbal stimulants be fore your workout -- and anytime -- as 
they could be very dangerous.  These include St. Johns Wort, yohimbe, ma huang, 
111 ephedrine, ephedra among others.  They ca n cause dangerously high blood pressure 
and irregular heart rhythms, and result in  death. The contents of herbals from 
different companies can be extremely variabl e, ranging from lit erally "zero" mg of 
the active ingredient to the fu ll value of what the label says.  
______________________________ 
In you feel ill, just  take the day off. 
______________________________ 
 
So here’s the precision, scientific ally designed exercise system  
Exercise at least 20 to 30 min. each day.  If you haven’t been exercising, start slowly 
for a few weeks.  Do it first thing in the morning -- later it's too easy to make excuses. I take at least one day off each 2 or 3 w eeks or when I feel the body needs rest.  
Warm up for 5 to 10 minutes whether you're going to do a weight tr aining or aerobic 
workout. Whether weight training or doing aerobi cs, start by stretchi ng. This will start the 
blood circulating, as well as break down the fibr ous material that builds in the tissues as we 
grow older. And stretch easily -- don't overe xtend your muscles.  Jog lightly until you 
break a light sweat.  At the start of each workout, warm up with some cardio exercises 
(walking, cycling) until you break a sweat.  St retch the muscles you will be working really 
well, easily at first. 
Start off easy during the first few weeks and ramp up.  But within a few months begin 
to really work it hard.  Drink extra water during the workout.   A nd you may modify this 
according to your own mental predisposition. Do not eat a large meal prior to working out, 
as blood will be diverted from the intestine and your digestion will not be as good. 
 
The Weight Training Component of Your System:  
Obviously, working out with wei ghts builds muscle. And even at 
rest, muscle burns calories – a very  good thing!  Muscle burns more 
calories than fat.  By building muscle your body is increasing its 
metabolic rate.  If you are over 25 and do not exercise, you are not 
building muscle, you are losing muscle. 
But weight lifting must be done properly, not only because injury 
can result, but heavy training not prop erly done can result in little or 
no results, or even muscle loss. 
Work out with weights on 3 of the 7 days each week.  Spread 
your weight workouts out with a day or two of cardiovascular 
exercise between them.   
If you haven’t lifted weights befo re or are out of shape, start 
slowly for a few weeks. Never lift more wei ght than you feel you can safely handle.   
Start lifting weights with a light set.  Use good form (described below). Injuries often occur when you try to lift too much 
weight. Focus on using proper form. Increase the weight  when you can do 12 to 15 reps 
easily and smoothly.  
Never hold your breath while li fting weights. Lift the weig hts slowly and smoothly, and 
exhale during the difficult part of  exercise – usually when extending.  
  
Pete building muscle 
with  a bench press  
112 Work opposing muscles on the same day -- ches t, back and abdominals, for example.  
On one of the days, work the chest and b ack muscles, abdominals and forearms.  On 
another, work the shoulders, biceps, triceps and forearms.  And of the other workout day, 
work the legs. It takes about a week for the muscle to heal, rebuild and grow. Working a 
particular muscle more often than once a w eek causes damage, so work any muscle group 
only once in a week. Refer to books on weight tr aining for specific lifts.   Have at least a 
few of sessions with a qualified and certified personal trainer.  Many gyms will give you training sessions as part of membership. 
After several weeks or months  of getting into shape, wh en normally lifting, lift heavy 
weights – as much as you can.  Do every set to “failure”, where you just can’t press any 
more, then slowly retract.  And form is im portant for getting the maximum benefit for your 
efforts, and for preventing injuries.  
Feel the muscle you’re working, and work ju st one muscle group or one muscle at a 
time.  Try to get a “burn” – a kind of hot sensa tion that most people know when they feel it.  
And muscles respond best to a variety of kinds of lifts, with different amounts of weight, 
different tempos, different types of exercise s (different angles and motions), and with 
varying numbers of repetitions  (typically around 6-8 reps fo r maximum muscle mass, and 
around 12 for best definition).   When I starte d I found that my muscles tended to be sore 
two days after working out, when I expected th is to be on the following day.  It's a sign you 
are building muscle.  If you are sore the da y after your weight wo rkout, you have overdone 
it. 
Here are some key concepts regarding form .  I’ll use the dumbbe ll bench press as an 
example. The weights should be extended (the  excentric or positive movement) to the 
count of 2, and retracted (concen tric or negative movement) to  the count of 6, and with no 
resting time between counts.  Most trainers  recommend a count of 3, but it's the negative 
motion that builds the muscle so that's why we  go with six counts.  Exhale when extending, 
inhale when bringing the weight s back.  Don’t extend or bring the weights back so that 
you’re resting at any time.   
When starting at the lower position, have  your upper arms extend straight out with 
elbows level with your shoulders – lower than  this risks rotator cuff (shoulder) damage.  
When extending, move the dumbbells to a posi tion above your head, in a triangular motion. 
Movement should be for a count of two.  M ove the dumbbells out to a position above your 
shoulders, then lowering for a count of six. 
The muscles should remain tensed throughout ea ch part of the lift -- do not extend the 
arms fully so as to lock the elbows and rest of the top or at the bottom of the lift.  Vary the 
kinds of lifts, the angles and the speed at di fferent workouts.  This will challenge your body 
and help you avoid a plateau, as muscles re spond to a change.  Eight repetitions will 
develop muscle size, and twel ve will develop definition.  A good combination for most 
people is two consecutive weeks workout s of 8 reps, then one of 12 reps. 
By changing routine, you force the body to be more efficient and snap out of 
complacency.  When keeping with the same weight training routine the muscles become 
complacent and we lose flexibility, as well as lose the different kinds of development the 
body can attain. 
And maintain good posture while lifting, as you are training your postural muscles as 
well.  This also will help you breathe correctly. 
Get your heart rate into your ta rget heart range (70- 80% of max heart rate) at failure for 
optimum results.  Then rest to bring it down to  somewhere in the '80s (preferably low '80s) 
before starting the next set. Lactic acid is the result of an aerobic exercise (not enough O 2 to 
113 the muscle - e.g. fatigue or full contraction of all the fibers in that  muscle group) when you 
left weights.  Bring the heart rate down will cl ear the lactic acid from your muscles.  You 
will need a pulse rate m onitor for this and for your aerobic exercise.  
New research indicates that doing just one set re sulted in between 70% and 88% of the 
increase in strength as compared to doing th ree sets.  In one exercise, the leg extension, 
doing one set at maximum efficiency and mi nimum amount of time expended resulted in 
an six percent increase in strength.  
For a muscle group I'll do just 1 sets each of  three different exercises.  For example, 
when working the chest it's something like 1 se t of bench press, 1 se t of reverse incline 
dumbbell press, then one set of cable flys.  But since the body responds to different kinds 
of exercises, I will vary the exercises with each workout. A majority of the time will be 
spent on bringing down the heart rate. 
Drink lots of water while working out. Also, have your protein meal  within one hour of 
ending your workout.  Protein dr inks mixed at smack bars in  gyms typically contain an 
awful lot of sugar and do mo re harm than good.  And unle ss you are certain your protein 
drinks sold at the snack bar contain high-qual ity whey & egg white protein that includes 
essential amino acids, use your own.  Usually I will have one scoop of Universal Milk & 
Egg protein along with 1/2 chicken breast a nd about 2 1/2 ounces of baked potato and 
about the 2-1/2 ounces of steamed vegetables, along with about a tabl espoon of olive oil. 
Your body requires adequate rest, as well as su fficient protein intake , for the repair of 
muscle (and you need sufficient carbohydrate for th is to happen).  It also requires adequate 
glycogen buildup in the cells fo r ATP generation.  If you have had adequate recovery your 
heart rate will go up to its maximum range -- at least 100 beats per minute.  If you are not 
getting adequate recovery, take a week off.   The body must recover on an ongoing basis.  
Pay attention when in the weight room, and have someone else watch over you  
(spot you) on difficult lifts.  Dropping a dumbbell on your head or any body part 
would hurt.  And don't do something like walk  into someone while they're straining to 
lift a barbell hoveri ng over their head! 
The Aerobic Exercise Component of Your System:  Do aerobic exercise at for least 20 
minutes for three days a week, and preferably fo ur.  It can consist of aerobics classes, or 
exercises like running (on a soft surface such as  grass), or fast walking.  Gradually warm 
up and increase your pulse rate over about 5 minutes until you reach your recommended 
heart rate.  You can also do your cardio on th e same day as your weights.  It's OK to do 
cardio before weights to increase heart rate and get an adequate warmup. 
You can do cardio (aerobic exercise) for mo re than 20 min (but not to exceed 40), 
depending on what you are trying to accomplish.  If you are trying to burn fat, more than 20 minutes is OK, but for cardiovasc ular fitness it's generally not  beneficial.   But for me it 
just seems like aerobic exercise for 25-30 mi nutes results in a lot better mood and joy of 
life. 
Your age predicted maximum heart rate (in beats per minute [bpm]) is computed as 220 
minus your age.  So for a fifty-yea r-old, the max would be 220 – 50 = 170 bpm 
If your goal is cardiovascular health:  Hear t rate of between 60% and 75% should be 
maintained for a maximum for 20 min.  So, for the 50 year old example above:  170 x 60% = 102 bpm  170 x 75% = 127.5 bpm 
If your goal is weight loss, it’s between 75% and 80% for 30 min. 
170 x 75% = 127.5 bpm 
114 170 x 85% = 144.5 bpm 
Dr. Lee-Benner cautions us:  Going over 80% of maximum 
heart rate is considered red lin ing it -- not good.  That's when 
you start losing more muscle (l ean body mass) than body fat -- 
a catabolic (breakdown) as opposed  to an anabolic (buildup) 
effect.  Also it injures the imm une system because it causes too 
much stress -- and increases the risk of cancer from the increase in free radical damage to DNA, and impaired killer cell function in the immune system (killer cells are the ones that seek out and destroy new cells with DNA mutations before 
they can become cancerous). 
I keep mine between 70% and 80%.  Again, you will need a 
pulse rate monitor to measure your pulse.   
Running (on a soft surface) as aerobic exercise is just fine.  It's OK to run part of the 
time and walk part of the time, the important th ing is keeping the heart rate in range.  It's 
not necessarily required to move the arms a nd upper torso a lot to get the benefits of 
aerobic exercise, such has increased vascularizat ion (the building of ve ssels and capillaries 
(tiny blood vessels) throughout your body.  The incr eased blood flow will provide nutrients 
and eliminate waste. 
I greatly prefer running in a natural setting to running in place on a treadmill and like to 
do a kind of jogging aerobics in a park or on the beach, jogging part of the time and 
moving the arms and legs all around in regular aerobics class kind of motion part of the 
time.  It gets a lot of funny looks from the seagulls.   
If you are under stress, do aerobic exercise tw ice a day for 20 min (but no more).   
Excessive aerobic exercise burns up your protein.   
This system may be modified to meet an individual’s interest and temperment.  Many 
people (especially seniors) gain a feeling of  autonomy and empowerment when working on 
bicycle or rowing machines.  And busy Type  A executives may go for the challenge of 
working against weight machines. 
Some people think that it's OK to load up with drinking sugary sports drinks, sodas or 
fruit juices when exercising.  But it is especially important to 
avoid these within 1 hour of exer cise because they can impair 
muscle performance and can also be responsible for pain, joint 
stiffness and the degeneration of arthritis of the spine. 
Do not overtrain.  If you feel extraordinarily tired or weak 
after your workout or for a day or two following your workout, take a week off then ease up on your regimen and consult your doctor.  
Also, stay away from all herbal stimulants before a workout, 
and at all times.  These include  St. Johns Wort, yohimbe, ma 
huang, ephedrine, ephedra among others. They can cause dangerously high blood pressure an d irregular heart rhythms, and 
result in death. 
Training methods can be quite sophisticated for high performance athletic training.  For 
example, interval training is basically wher e you do short bursts of peak effort (like wind 
sprints).  These are best done under expert guidance.

115 Yoga 
Although yoga can bring you great benefits to your life, for exercise purposes yoga will 
best be considered a flexibil ity building method, and should no t be substituted for weight 
training and aerobic exercise.  Excessive yoga practice wit hout necessary weight and 
aerobic training results in too much flexibility and inadequate muscle tone and strength.  
The yoga techniques of stretching, deep re laxation, breathing, and visualization are 
powerful tools for stress management.  But even  more important is yoga's value for helping 
you transform.   It can help you learn to open our hearts to your f eelings, and to reach 
lasting inner peace and happiness. 
Yoga originated as not so much a physical ex ercise, but rather as a spiritual exercise.  
Yoga literally means "union with God".  Tantri c yoga can take you to the highest level of 
spiritual awareness.  Along these lines, the book "Luminous Emptiness" by Francesca 
Fremantle, is highly recommended. 
See the appendix for more information on exercise.  
Now Take Some Action 
The exercise habit comes pretty easy.  You are likely to be drawn to daily exercise 
because it feels good, long after the workout.  OK, that may happen after some initial 
soreness, but even that hurts good.  If you need help in forming a habit of daily exercise, 
visit the section on "Behavior Modification and Motivation". 
 
An Exercise Sensation 
Suzanne Somers, who played that adorable but dingy "Chrissy" in the TV show Three's 
Company invented an exercise device called th e "Thigh Master".  It's simplicity will amaze 
you -- you just put the thing between your legs and squeeze your legs in and out!  Actually, 
that exercise only works a few muscles on the inte rior part of the thigh (the gracilis major, 
adductor magnus major, adductor brevis major and adductor longus major if you really 
must know), but it really work s them.  If you develop big muscles on the inside of your 
thighs people are sure to notice.  Both because of their impressive size, and because your thighs will slap together when you walk around the gym!  Just kidding.  Actually you can 
get the same effect by straddling a medicine ba ll and squeezing your th ighs together for 3 
sets of 25 contractions each. 
Hey, I bet if you're a woman your lover wi ll notice (nudge, nudge, wink, wink). I don't 
know, do you think the Thigh Master s hould go in the "Sex" section?   
This just in!  Suzanne has now invented an electronic contraption called the "Face 
Master"  (I personally avoid elec trical stimulation)  What's next?  Is the world ready for a 
"Butt Master"? 
OK OK, enough Thigh Master bashing.  No, I don't necessarily recommend the thing -- 
just got back from the gym, feeling fr isky and trying to have a little fun. 
Anyway, have you noticed how Suzanne looks  forever adorable & young?  And in case 
you haven't noticed, she's really smart too.  P. S. You can actually use the Thigh Master to 
work other muscles than the gracilis major, etc. etc. 
Addendum:  This just in! --  I was out for a walk  and passed a garage sale last week, 
and guess what I saw???  A genuine Suzanne Somers Butt Master !!!   But from the size of 
the proprietress's tush it must n't have been used much. 
116 Chapter 6 -- Happiness, Mental Clarity and Performance 
 
 
What Do You Really Want? 
Isn't it really happiness -- for 
yourself and for others? 
   
 
A Healthy Brain is a Happy Brain 
It doesn’t matter if you ha ve a healthy 120 year-old body if you don’t know who or 
where you are.  The system in this book is de signed to keep your br ain and mind at their 
peak, as well as the rest of you.  
In past chapters we looked at how your br ain and mental health and abilities are 
affected by diet, nutritional supplements and exercise, and some other factors that are 
within your control right now .  And by the way, although the supporting cells of the brain 
are replaced it has been found th at certain parts of the brai n really do grow new neurons 
(under specific conditions). 
The scientifically design ed, precision nutrition and exercise, stress reduction, 
appropriate amounts of well-de signed nutritional supplements, and other methods found in 
this manual can do a lot to im prove your mental well-being. 
On this system, protein, neurotransmitter a nd nutrient deficiencies or other problems 
can be resolved, thereby bringing more joy and happiness, more energy, a clearer mind 
with better concentration and improved pr oblem solving abilities, a more carefree 
approach, and a renewed enjoyment a nd spark of enthusiasm for life. 
Lowering levels of the destructive stress hor mones cortisol and adrenaline (a powerful 
muscle stimulant) that are pumped out during periods of stress by calming revved-up 
physiological functions will do much to pres erve and protect your brain function, clear 
your head and raise your consciousness and me ntal abilities. The end result is greater 
health and happiness. 
When your body, brain, and mind are tuned up working as well as they can, don't be 
surprised if things that have upset you or  problems that have dogged you no longer matter 
and just float away -- irrelevant and meani ngless, barely remembered.  You come to 
realizations that weren't easily apparent. Things are in perspec tive, in proper order.  Mood 
swings resulting from neutransmitter depletions  and insulin highs or lows may subside.  
Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are re leased from a nerve cell and transmit an 
impulse from one cell to another, be it nerve, muscle, or other organ or tissue.  The main 
ones in the nervous system are called GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin, and 
they are vital to the functioning of your brai n and body. Their production declines with age. 
On this system you'll now be getting the raw materials your body needs to manufacture these neurotransmitters and other component s key to brain, mind and spiritual health. 
 
117 Also, it's important to keep your brain stimul ated.  "Use it or lose it" applies to your 
brain and mind, as well as the body.  Take up new pastimes, try new mental tasks, 
continually remain stimulated.  Your brai n will continue grow more connections and 
stimulate neurotransmitter production. 
 
What's Going On Physiologically When You're  S T R E S S E D ? 
When we sense a threat, in a matter of seconds your body 
biochemically prepares for exertion.  Your adrenal glands 
produced about 40 hormones, but primarily the stress hormones 
cortisol and adrenaline (epinephr ine).  When under stress, the 
adrenal glands secrete lots of these, which rev up your 
metabolism to prepare us to either fight or run -- "fi ght or flight". 
These states may be acute (immediate, short-term) or chronic 
(long-term).  This is DESTRUCTIVE! 
Blood pressure and heart rate increase, and digestion is 
halted allowing the body to dedica te its energy to the muscles. 
Blood flow is shunted from less critical areas such  as skin and stomach, to more vital areas 
such as brain, heart, and muscles in preparation to create a state of a ggression or fear.   In 
extreme situations the bo wel and bladder empty.  
Extra blood cells flow out of the spleen, allowing the blood to carry more oxygen to 
muscles.  The liver converts sugar stored as  glycogen to glucose and calls up fat reserves 
(cholesterol, triglyce rides, and LDL, etc.) for quick energy.  The excess cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and LDL don't get metabo lized right away, so they hang around the 
bloodstream increasing the risk of  being deposited in the vessel  walls which leads to heart 
disease, and athersclerosis, as well as peripheral vascular disease, etc.   
Insulin is released in respons e to the elevated glucose.  As we found in the nutrition 
section, glucose causes oxidati on damage within the body.  So excess glucose really a bad 
thing.  Pain sensitivity decrease s.  The probability of survivin g this crisis has increased, but 
a dreadful long-term deterioration has begun. 
Cells lose potassuim and retain calcium a nd sodium, and free radicals are generated 
causing damage.   Blood is shunted away from  capillaries and the concentration of blood 
clotting mechanisms increases, to reduce bleed ing in case of injury.  Intracellular  
components such as mitochondria, liposomes, endoplasmic reticulum and outer cell wall membranes take a beating, and nerve and muscle action slows.   
A few minutes after the flight or flight response begins, your body makes other changes 
in an attempt to stabilize and replenish itself.  Your liver converts fa t into usable fuel.  
Immune function is diminished, probably in order to increase available energy.  In the 
brain, the hippocampus (the center for memo ry and learning) becomes activated.   
The net effect of all the cort isol and adrenaline is to d ecrease immunity, in order to 
conserve resources for what your body automati cally senses to be a more immediate and 
urgent requirement at hand.  Senses become acu te and the body begins to excrete an odor.  
In situations of great er stress, the hands and feet beco me cold and clammy as blood is 
directed away from the extremities and redir ected to the brain and major organs, and the 
large muscles that are us ed for fighting and running. 
But wait, there's more . . . 

118 The body converts sex hormones into stress hormones (cortisol, and adrenaline), so 
there goes your love life even  if you wanted one in situations of high stress.  Over time 
your adrenals increase in size to keep up w ith the request for increased production. Did you 
see that movie about the worm-like creature from outer space that  bores through the ear 
and eats your brain?  Well, stress is kind of like that but you're mostly doing it to yourself 
because over time cortisol can be toxic.   Th is cascades into depression.  High cortisol 
levels have been associated w ith depressive disorders, stre ss, anxiety states, and memory 
loss. 
Stress lowers your frustration tolerence, thereby predisposing you to become more 
upset about minor irritations. 
Decreases in blood flow to the stomach and intestines leave the mucous lining 
vulnerable to ulcers.  Actually there is an in crease in the flow of gastric acids to speed 
digestion, and a decline in mucous production wh ich is a "protective fa ctor" against ulcers 
and erosive gastritis.   
Communication happens in both directions  between the nervous, endocrine and 
immune systems. Stressors affect the imm une system by disrupting these networks.  
Functions of the immune system, like anti body production and cellula r immunity from T-
cell activity may also be impaired as a result  of the oxidative stress.  Lymphocytes, which 
are loaded with fatty acids to help them  fight your body’s invaders, but under stress 
lymphocytes turn against your body’s own immu ne to system. Stress throws a number of 
other components of your immune system out of whack, resulting in  decreased prevention 
of disease. 
Your immune system can go away -- losi ng self-tolerance and a ttacking your own body 
creating autoimmune disorders su ch as asthma, arthritis, scleroderma, lupus, psoriasis, and 
allow cell mutations to survive and become cancerous.   
The adrenals grow in response to chroni c stress, so you get upset and angry bored 
easily and stay upset and angry for longer. Over time, or if the stress response is activated 
too often, the cortisol becomes toxic to brai n cells -- cognitive ab ility is damaged, and 
fatigue, anger and depression ensue.  
And stress can indirectly harm us.  Have you noticed that your good eating and exercise 
habits go out the window when you’re  stressed?  This is often because of a hormone imbalance in the brain.  When we are stre ssed, the brain releases a chemical called 
corticotropin-releasing hormone, or CRH, that suppresses appetite. The adrenal glands then 
secrete their powerful fight-or-f light stress hormones, adrenali ne and cortisol, which propel 
sugar into the bloodstream for a short-term ener gy rush. After that rush, cortisol sparks the 
hunger for carbohydrates and fat.    
And how many times did you make really dumb mistakes, or miss really great 
opportunities, when you were stressed?  Have yo u ever been in an accident when you were 
distracted because of stress? 
 
Cells in the hippocampus are critical for memory.  The release of steroids caused 
by stress kills them, so your memory worsens with the long-term effect of dementia.  
But perhaps the worst part of it is that you  lose the ability to turn off the steroids 
that are causing the damage.  Additional stre ss, not only psychological but things like 
low blood sugar or low oxygen, kills more brai n cells. The result is a vicious cycle of 
more stress –  and more damage! 
119 In the short term, sure, these changes will give you more strength to fight oh, say, a 
sabre tooth tiger.  We all have a lot of those to  deal with in our dail y lives?  But in today's 
world these elaborate preparations are wasted.   
 
Science shows that people get sick when under stress 
There are a very great number of scientif ic studies showing the relationship between 
stress and illness.  For example, UCLA experiment tracked a group of patients with 
melanoma, a potentially lethal skin cancer . Half the group receiv ed mind/body therapy, 
including support-group in teraction and relaxatio n techniques to reduc e their stress. After 
six years, patients who received the additional therapy were th ree times less likely to suffer 
a recurrence of cancer and three times less lik ely to have died than those who did not. 
It stands to reason that the military would be  interested in knowing about the effects of 
stress.  A study conducted for the U.S. Navy showed that men who had gone through stress 
causing profound life changes (lik e job loss or divorce) had a greater chance of becoming 
sick within the months following their proble ms than those who suffered no such changes. 
Stress also has an effect on those who care for those who are ill.  So this is yet another 
part of the vicious cycle of stress -- stress causes illness, which in turn causes stress in 
those who care for them.  In a study conducted by researchers at Ohio State University it 
was shown that chronically stressed women car ing for dementia patients took an average of 
nine days longer to heal a small biopsy w ound than those in a control group.   The 
caregivers blood cells produced le ss of a chemical involved in immune defense that is 
important for wound healing.  They also found th at caregivers of patie nts with Alzheimer's 
disease didn't produce as much of an antibody in  response to a flu vaccine as controls. The 
caregivers also did not produce as  much of a T-cell reaction. 
These are just a few of the many studies that have been done demonstrating the 
connection between stress and a variety of illnesses.  
Or how would you like a nice cold or a case of  the flu?  When you're stressed and your 
immune defenses are down, you're a lot more  likely to get a minor malady, and suffer the 
discomfort and lack of productivity that accompanies it.  
See the appendix for more information on stress. 
 
The Power of Imagination 
Your nervous system cannot tell the differe nce between an imagined experience and a 
real experience.  In either case, it reacts automa tically to information which you give it 
from your forebrain.  Your nervous system reacts appropriately to what you think or 
imagine to be true.   Getting ready to go on a vacation can be stressful, as well as the initial 
effect of being away from your regular routine.  Of course, af ter that period of adjustment 
you will relax, but, then getting back into your work-routine creates more stress again.  
Change of routine, change of employment, je t lag, all are stressful.  Every hour of time 
zone change requires a full day of adjustment. So avoid making important decisions until that period of adjustment has passed. 
 
It's As Though We Create Our Wo rld By Our Thoughts And Actions 
It's as though we design our world by our thoughts and actions.  We can influence how 
we perceive the world by our thoughts -- and some spiritual and religious schools believe 
that our thoughts directly  affect the physical world itself.   I plan to investigate whether 
some physicists are confirming this with quantum physics, etc.   
120 My friend Jean is a computer consultant and former pop and jazz musician who is 
sometimes, well, takes things a little too seri ously.  He relays to me "I recently had a 
situation where I was sloshing around, forgetting to do my Behavior Modification and Motivation methods described in Chapter 2.  It was a cloudy, kind of gloomy day. As 
described in "Once an hour every hour" I wr ote down how I feel re ally good, very happy 
and at peace, filled with energy etc., and just then some clouds must have opened up 
because for a brief while it was sunny!  And when I got home I opened an Email saying that the $2700 check I was expecting (havi ng some doubt whether it would ever come) 
would be arriving soon!"  And it did!

So Cut the S tress  
Some stress reducing solutions to heal your body, mind and spirit:  
Although it's sometimes simple to say but difficult to do -- look for and reduce the 
underlying causes of stress. 
Pay attention to what’s going on inside you the next time you’re rushing around under 
siege.  Take a moment and ask: Is my breat hing shallow or am I hol ding my breath?  Are 
my muscles tight? Is my mind racing from one thought to another, never really thinking 
anything through to completion?  Is a fast  song running through my head?  Am I all 
hunched over and developing a “turtle back” co mmon in a lot of people who work with 
computers? Are my shoulders pulled up? Am  I wearing a scowl, resulting in semi-
permanent wrinkles etched in my face?  Or  having imaginary arguments and fights with 
people I feel have done me wrong?  Or worse yet, am I having road rage that sooner or later 
will lead to an life-shattering accident? 
All this is just an outward reflection of  the damage you're doing to yourself on the 
inside. And the worst part is that it is  often self-inflicted and can be avoided. 
Our bodies operate about the same today as  they were when we were cave-dwelling 
hunters and gatherers 50,000 years ago. In those days, we lived by our wits, killing animals 
for food and protected ourselves and our their families against attack either by fighting or 
by running away.   Although this can get us out  of physically life-t hreatening situations, 
today we invoke much the same response to non -life-threatening situ ations like giving a 
speech, worrying about money, having a healthy c onfrontation with someone or flying in 
an airplane. These can have much the same ef fect as being chased by wild animals nonstop 
from sunrise to bedtime.   
Many of us are stressed that we don't even know it.  We get conditioned to feel that 
stress is normal, or even miss the excitement  when things are calm. Some people become 
hooked on the stress, and even become listless or  bored, or feel that something is missing 
when not on the edge.  Over the long term ev en moderate amounts of these biological and 
mental changes add up to immense damage. 
121 The damaging physical and mental changes th at occur during stress can be stopped and 
reversed.  Applying this system, particul arly the exercise, meditation, nutrition, and 
nutritional supplement parts, wi ll do a lot to reduce your chronic stress le vel.  Meditation, 
deep relaxation, hypnosis and prayer are all rela ted in the way they affect your biology and 
reduce stress.  
Recognize when you are under stress -- many of  us are stressed that we don't even 
know it.  Take corrective act ion early.  Begin by breathing deeply and relaxing the body 
then and there.  Break that stress habit. 
My friend Jean, the computer consultant, told  me about a damage control situation that 
happened to him recently:  "When a supplie r dragged his feet and didn't secure a 
component that was both vital to my business (and  near and dear to my heart) I started to 
get really, really, and I mean really upset.  Fortunately, I recognized what was happening 
right away, and how the downward spiral that  was starting was completely unnecessary.  
So I took control of the situa tion and immediately shifted into  correction mode.  First, I 
wrote down on a piece of paper 'The bad feeling about this has left. It is replaced by calm 
and assurance that things will be fine and this is for the best' according to the 'once an hour every hour' technique under the Motivation and Behavior Modification section of Johnny's 
manual. Then I meditated to physiologically and mentally calm down. Then, I used the 
'eraser' technique that I learned from some  Anthony Robbins materials to just undo it from 
my mind about it. 
When under abnormal stress, try the followi ng and find what you like and what works 
best for you.  Recognize that you can endure anything. 
The next section on meditation covers a lot of  relaxation methods.  Meditate for at least 
40 min.daily.  And when stressed, twice daily  would be even better.  A section on 
meditation follows.   
Exercise is the best stress buster.  If you are under a lo t of stress, do a second aerobic 
exercise session for about 20 minutes (don't exercise much longer because it will start to 
burn the protein in your body for fuel).   Don't be  tempted (like I have been) to just sit in 
front of the TV "relaxing" -- get your butt up and exercise.   You will feel better.  You just 
can't afford to not undo the physical and ment al damage, can you?  While your spouse or 
friends may forgive you for some bad judgmen t, can you afford to make a wrong decision 
while driving your car, or to make a very bad decision at work because you are all wound up.  Get up and go!  You'll feel a release al most immediately.  Go go go!  Exercise! 
Relaxation is liberation.  By implementing stress relieving and relaxing methods your 
health will improve almost immediately and you will feel much, much better.  Another 
good stress-reduction method (also a meditation method) is to pr ogressively relax parts of 
your body, starting with the feet, ankles, up to  the calves and moving upward.  Spend more 
time on any part of the body that's particularly  tight.  This will settle your body's chemistry 
and spirit.  Listening to a relaxation audio ta pe can be much more helpful than doing it 
alone.  Envision all the stress, the problems, the worries and heartaches as draining down 
and out of your body, being replaced by a golde n light that brings healing, joy and 
relaxation.   
Make the decision to do someth ing about unnecessary stress. 
Think back on a time when you were joyful a nd filled with power.  Play some music 
that reminds you of that time. 
Get a massage. Make love with your lovi ng and willing (and hopefully enthusiastic) 
partner.  Adapt a more spiritual outlook.  Make  an affirmation to reduce stress a part of 
122 your “Once an hour, every hour” routine.  Or  just go for a long walk and focus on the 
outward beauty of the world and untangle the close focus of attention that you've been 
giving to your work or your PC, or on your thoughts or in ternal turmoil.  
Do yoga, listen to soothing music.  Write about  the stressful periods of your life.  Do 
some things to feel more in control of your lif e -- make a list of things to do or set some 
goals (hopefully overachievement is not what got you in this stress in the first place). 
Having fun and laughing releases endorphi ns in your brain to soothe you, and 
interleuken, a powerful cancer fighting and interferon drug is also released.  The tranquil 
experience produces a relaxing surge of diazepam -- the real valium.  
When you're rushing off to work to do erra nds, stop to smell the ro ses -- and the grass, 
and the air.   While you're at it, take a look at  the sky and the trees, listen to the birds and 
the feel of the breeze. 
Perhaps under situations of extreme une xpected stress, a littl e valium or similar 
relaxant, under the guidan ce of your physician, could be the right thing for you. 
Reduce stimulation, relax and lounge around fo r an entire day.  Impractical?  Well, 
maybe not as much as you believe.  Thi nk of how much more you'll get done, and how 
much clearer your decision making will be, after an entire day of nothing. 
 
Choose to be happy 
Mark Twain once wrote that people are as ha ppy as they decide to be.  So deciding to 
be happy would be a good first step down the happy trail.   
 
Act Happy 
     There is a direct connection between  your body movements and neurochemistry.  It’s 
called “neuro-kineseology”.  Act happy.  Talk  happy. Think happy.  Put a big silly grin on 
your face.  Move all around happy -- arms, legs, big smile. Walk a happy walk. Put a skip in your step.  Do a happy dance.  Do the th ings that happy people do.  Fake happy 'till you 
make happy.  Fill your heart with love. A nd put the characteristics of happy people 
described above into action.  This will se nd a signal to your ne uro-endocrine system 
resulting in the release of endorphins and impr oved receptivity to them.  And it will trigger 
your positive emotions, and the soon it will become a habit.   
I had an unpleasant situation lately and wa s lied to, cheated and stressed.  I put a big 
happy silly grin on my face, walked a fun,  happy silly walk, put the problems out of 
my mind – and felt a WHOLE LOT BETTER!   
This can work for you. 
 
Meditation and Deep Relaxation 
Meditation has been defined as the "self-regulation of attention." It 
can clear your head and raise your consciousness. It increases 
creativity and intelligence, improves memory and learning ability. It improves energy and promotes inner calm and peace. Our muscles and nervous and endocrine systems have a kind of "memory" in that they 
store the hurts, fears, upsets a nd sadness that you may experience 
throughout the day.  Medita tion helps dissipate this. The end result is 
that we are healthier and happier.       
 
Mi meditating  
123 Meditation can be divided into two (o r more) major types of techniques: 
"concentration" meditation, which encompa sses transcendental meditationTM and the 
relaxation response, and "mindfulness" (or "i nsight") meditation, which uses one-point 
attention to cultivate calmness and stability.  
There are many kinds of meditation, and diffe rent methods are suited to different 
people. Some of the major methods are Zen, Yoga, Sufi, Gurdjieff and Transcendental. 
"Paths" of meditation include through the intellect, the em otions, the body, and through 
action. How to Meditate by Lawrence LeShan (Back Bay Books) is an excellent book that 
goes into the background and practical application.   
Some of the main purposes of meditation ar e to achieve deep re laxation, and quiet the 
mind and give it a break and allow it to replenish neurotransmitters. This is accomplished, in part, by stopping all the mental chatter. Medi tation reverses the negative effects of stress. 
Meditation lowers the cortisol and adrenaline that build up wh en you are under daily stress, 
reducing the physiological cascade that thes e damaging hormones trigger. So worries 
diminish, problems don't loom as large, worr y, anger, frustration de cline, and fear and 
aches & pains will even diminish, blood flow to the brain increases, good hormones like growth hormone, testosterone, and estrogen increase and come into balance. Happiness, 
confidence and memory improve. The benefits of meditation will become apparent very soon after starting. The result can be dramatic.     
Alpha brain waves (slow electr ical firing of the brain associated with relaxation) 
increase during meditation. The hormone melat onin is associated with better sleep and 
meditation can increase levels of melatonin in the fluid portion of blood. It remains to be 
determined whether this is achieved through decreased hepati c (liver) metabolism of the 
hormone or via a direct effect on the pi neal gland, where melatonin is produced.  
Transcendental meditation (TM
TM) is based on traditional Indian vedic philosophy and 
is the method often used in scientific resear ch studies because of the specifics of its 
application. The goals of TM involve inducing less active thinking processes and creating a 
state of "restful alertness." It was founde d by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (the guru to the 
Beatles) and is perhaps the most widely know n.  There are seven step s to learning TM. The 
Maharishi Health Education Centre s describe it as a simple, natu ral, effortless technique.   
Many effects on physiology have been reporte d in the TM medical literature. These 
include decreased respiratory ra te, decreased skin conductance,  decreased total peripheral 
resistance, increased alpha-wave activity as measured by an electro encephalogram (EEG), increased frontal and occipital lobe (parts of  the brain associated with thought, motor and 
visual function) blood flow, alterations of hor mone levels, decreased serum lipid peroxide, 
decreased beta-receptor sensitivity, decreased er ythrocyte glycolysis and decreased serum. 
I'll not go into what these are now, but suffi ce it to say that these are good things. The 
bottom line -- TM is believed to have a beneficial effect upon risk factors for cardiovascular disease, includi ng high cholesterol, high blood  pressure, and even tobacco 
use.  
Every moment you are relaxed results in an improvement. 
 
Transcendental Meditation and the Prevention of Heart Disease and Other 
Positive Effects on Health 
This part relates to what is often called "mind-body medici ne", addressing the intimate 
relationship and influences of the mind and body upon one another and it is related to the 
"placebo effect" (discussed later).   Medita tion is one form of mind-body medicine.     
124 One randomized, controlled study examined the effects of regular TM on carotid 
(heart) atherosclerosis.  One group was asked to meditate twice a day for 20 minutes, the 
other (called the "health education group") was asked to devote the same timeframes to any 
leisure activity, like reading or  exercising.  The study lasted seven months.   In comparison 
to the health education group, the TM group showed a significant decrease in carotid 
atherosclerosis -- and the health ed ucation group had an increase.   
Positive results have also been reported in  studies using TM for patients with angina 
(pain or discomfort from a blockage in th e coronary artery, resulting in not enough blood 
getting to the heart), high blood pressure and high cholesterol. 
Some studies have demonstrated positive resu lts of TM such as a reduction in health 
care visits, mood disturbances, cancer surv ival rates and psychosomatic symptoms. 
Important: TM or other forms of medi tation should not be used as a 
healing method that substitute for traditional medical treatment. 
 
How to Meditate 
Twenty minutes meditation each day, in the form  that works best for you, is essential in 
your system.  Try it first thing in the morning and see how it sets the tone for the day.  Or 
perhaps the middle of the day or the evening is best for you.  Twice a day meditations 
would be even better, and it should be  done anytime stress begins to build. 
Some forms of meditation are structured and others are unstructur ed.  Meditations are 
done sitting, lying or standing. There are medita tions to connect you with  the spirit, but the 
one I use is one that empties the mind.  Here 's a brief introduction to some ways to 
meditate in this way. You can meditate with  a friend, and meditating with a dog or a cat 
can be soothing for all concerned.   
One way is to stop all thoughts as much as po ssible.  Deeply relax the muscles -- "past" 
the point of just being relaxed to where ever y tension is totally re leased. Breathe deeply 
from the diaphragm -- this is vital. "From th e diaphragm" means you feel the lower part of 
the lungs filling up with air fi rst as your tummy goes out, then  up through your chest as the 
lungs fill.  Exhale in reverse by letting out th e air from the top down.   Your heartbeat will 
automatically slow with each exhalation. 
The idea is to deeply relax and set aside th e conscious mind, or ego.  Stop the mental 
meandering and mental chatter. 
Posture is important.  Sit up straight, with back straight and lower back supported, and 
head centered above the shoulders.  Legs may be  crossed if you like.  If you meditate while 
lying down your mind is more likely to wander or go to sleep.   
It may take a while to ease into the s oothing meditative state of mind.  But as the 
minutes pass, more and more you'll fi nd yourself calming and unruffling.   
Don't be tempted to fall asleep while meditating.  Sleep is good and if you can squeeze 
in a nap sometime during the day, that's just gr eat.  But sleep is not meditation and you do 
not get the same beneficial effects.  And of course, thinking about problems is not 
meditation.  However, ideas, answers to quest ions or solutions to problems just may pop 
into your head while without trying.  Perhap s you are using the untapped power of your 
mind, or maybe the angels or God are whisperi ng in your ear.  You may have to make a 
decision whether to write it down on a piece of paper or wait until later.  (But if you don't 
write it down right away you'll probably forget). 
125 There are many ways to meditate.  We're all different, and different  kinds of meditation 
will appeal to different people.  Counting breat hs teaches the ability to do one thing at a 
time.  Some of us tend to pro cess the world visually, so it st ands to reason that they may 
prefer a visual form of me ditation by envisioning somethi ng soothing or something to 
change.  Others process the world by sound more  than by the other senses, so they may like 
to hear soothing sounds to help them meditate .  And others tend to process the world in 
terms of the way they feel, so they may prefer to concentrate on their breathing or the feel 
of something soothing.  Perhap s while taking a nice warm bat h.  There is even a soothing 
moving meditation where you walk across the room absolutely as slowly as possible.  And 
you can combine several sensory methods.  Tr y different ways and find what works for 
you. 
You can concentrate on a particular sound, or a color, or an object in the room. Or 
imagine a calm, soothing scene -- clouds, a park, the wilderness, a sunset.  Use your 
imagination to visualize the scene and hear the sounds of birds or  waterfalls, "smell" 
freshly cut grass, "feel" the warmth of the sun.  Or listen to a tape or CD recording of the 
great outdoors with birdies going tweet tweet and maybe the bgloishhhhh  of a blabbling 
brook.  Or go out in the woods to experience thes e for real.  Silently watch the branches of 
a tree from a window as they gently bend in the breeze.  Or listen to soothing music or the slow and deeply resonant tones of a wind chime.  
Perhaps envision all the stress, the problems,  the worries and heartaches as draining 
down and out of you.  And imagine the words or  symbols for youth, joy, life -- as well as 
contentment, confidence, carefree, fun, or wh atever as they flow into you. Or healing, 
golden light accompanied by feelings of joy a nd loving, and the sound of beautiful music. 
Out with the bad, in with the good. 
A mandala is a circular geometric pattern used as for meditation.  Meditators have 
gazed upon mandalas to induce a quite, inner pe ace.  Mandalas have been used in every 
corner of the world, from Tibetan mandalas,  Native American sand paintings, to Hindu 
Yantras, to the Christian Rose Window, to the Jewish Star of David, to Islamic geometric 
patterns.   
Do NOT stare at the s un or a bright object. 
Some people can go into a meditative state by tilting the eyes upward about 45 degrees.  
A relaxation audio tape can put you into deep meditation and keep the mind from 
wandering.  Just sit and listen.  Try to s it up straight while meditating, as lying down 
usually doesn't work well.  
Try a relaxing "rolling meditation". N o, not by rolling on the ground.  Feel the 
relaxation roll up and down your body from head to  toe with each cycle taking about 2 or 3 
seconds and a brief pause between each one . Spend more time on any part of the body 
that's particularly tight.  Scan your body, seek out and unwind those tense body parts on a 
"search and relax" mission. 
And if you need a creative solution try th is: tell yourself wh at you want, sit and 
meditate, clear your mind of all thoughts ( do not think or try to reason through the 
problem).  Wait for answer to pop out. 
Or count slowly from zero and go as high as you can without having thoughts pop into 
your mind (number cruncher types may like this, but then again, they may want to get away 
from numbers for a while).  The moment you feel  a thought, start from one again.  Don’t be 
concerned if you didn’t get very far.  It’s no t a contest. If your mind should wander, just 
126 keep coming back. With each count, and in each moment, you are healing your mind and 
body and becoming more refreshed.  
Or if you are an engineering type, envision ga uges or bar charts with the labels of 
physical parameters like "cortisol", "adrenalin e", "blood pressure" and the like, and others 
with labels pertaining to yourse lf like "worry",  "anger" a nd "tummy upset" or the like -- 
these are going down as you meditate.  And th e ones labeled "white blood cells" or 
"oxygen flow", "calm", "contentm ent", "joy", etc. are rising. 
See how low you can get your heart rate (your  heart rate monitor will come in handy 
for this).   
Chanting can be good -- like "Aaaaahhhhhh"  (the sound of creation) or 
"Ooooohhmmmm" (the sound of tha nkfulness), or "whateverrrrr".  It would be fine to 
make a chanting sound throughout your medita tion, or if you feel your mind start to 
wander, start chanting until it's again centere d.  Sunrise and sunset are particularly 
synchronous powerful meditation times. 
Write down a question or a problem on a piece of paper, then meditate.  Wait for an 
answer. 
I have known a couple of people who seem to process their worlds by food!  One was a 
really good cook and the other was bulimic.  An alogies of food are often woven into their 
conversations, and they will tend to laugh more  at jokes when produce is involved. I once 
heard how, if asking for directions, some pe ople will say "Go down th e street until you 
reach the McDonald's Burger Joint and turn  right, then go down to the Piggly Wiggly 
supermarket and turn left . . ." etc.  I don' t know, maybe to meditate  they could think of 
jell-o gently jiggling in the breeze.  Better ma ke that steamed vegetables.  Or the ancient 
zen quotation "Life is just  a bowl of cherries." 
Just be still. Quiet the chatter. Listen.  Y ou will feel the hurts, fears, upsets and sadness, 
all the upsetting memories of events of the da y that have caused you stress will dissipate.  
Feel your body becoming filled with health and healing. 
Don't be dismayed if you do experience an  unusual sensation resembling a flash of 
light, a  scene or a sound.  This could be  anything from auto-suggestion (self-hypnosis) 
leading to a self-induced hallucina tory experience (similar to an LSD effect), to a release in 
neurochemicals such as endorphins  or neurochemicals that have  a stimulatory effect on the 
senses arising from the occipi tal lobe (associated with visi on) or the mid brain and limbic 
system  (emotions). 
Perhaps ask the spirit for an answer to a question, then sit quie tly and listen for the 
answer. And don't forget to give thanks in your meditations for your many gifts. 
Also, thinking about events, problems etc. is  not meditation.  But don't be surprised if 
ideas or solutions to problems pop into your head  without trying.  If this happens to may be 
faced with a decision whether to interrupt  your meditation and write down on a piece of 
paper what has come to you.  (You probably will forget if you don't write down then and 
there). 
Just stop thinking for a while. Similar to nutritional habits  and adequate amounts of daily  water intake, this one is 
easy to let slip. The ultimate goal of every med itation is to empty the mind of all thoughts, 
even if it is only a brief moment in time.  A successful meditation passes quickly, because 
for that moment, you have you have left your body and are floating in timespace. 
127 Any meditation should make you more alert, but if you do  also feel kind of groggy 
after meditating, don't operate a motor vehi cle, heavy equipment, fly an airplane or 
do anything dangerous that woul d require your full concentration. 
 
Johnny's favorite meditation  
Try this as you read about it.  It's a little difficult to describe, but it really does it for me 
so here goes: Sit up straight, with back stra ight and head centered above the shoulders.  
Eyes are usually closed, but can be open wh ile looking at an object.  Relax all over, but 
particularly around the head, face and eyes. Af ter a short while I try to feel what the 
difficult to describe feeling of a kind of "loosening" and "sinking" and "opening up" 
sensation, particularly in the head, eyes, betw een and behind the eyes, and the entire body.  
Something like a soft mental  "cap" drops down and covers my head.  Breathe deeply 
through the nose, down into the diaphragm, and exhale slowly through the mouth, in 
reverse by letting out the air fr om the top down. During, and especially at the end of each 
breath, become a more deeply relaxed.  Relax ev en further "past" the point of just relaxing 
the muscles, to where every muscle fiber is  released -- head, eyes, and between & behind 
the eyes, and in the entire body.  Soon, almost from somethi ng you could perhaps describe 
as the “third eye”, a kind of field of vision seems to “open up” .  It's nothing as clear as 
actually looking at a real scene, but more  of a sensation.  You may possibly kind of 
envision a plain, or the ocean, or  a field with mountains in th e distance, but it's more of a 
sensation of "distance vision" that's really ha rd to describe.  Shor tly after each exhalation 
feel the experience of sinking and detachme nt, going deeper relaxed. If your mind should 
wander, just keep coming back.  Continue to  relax the head, eyes, and between & behind 
the eyes, and in the entire body, and progressi vely relax different parts of body (starting 
from the toes, to the feet, up to the ankles et c. for example). Breathe deep, sink, detach, and 
go deeper relaxed. Breathe deep, sink, detach, an d deeper relax.  It wi ll probably take about 
20 minutes, but when you're there you'll know it.  Breathe deep, sink, detach, relax, and try 
to get that field of distance vision to "open up".  Feel the area around and behind your eyes 
become particularly relaxed and open up. That’s  it!  I this works for you, it really does it 
for me.  You will feel serene, refreshed, and experiencing the world anew.  Maybe a little 
groggy, but in a nice sort of way.  And ag ain, don't operate a motor vehicle, heavy 
equipment, or do anything dangerous requiring your full concentrati on if you're feeling 
groggy. 
After finishing a meditation, hold onto that state of mind.  Should a disturbing thought 
pop into your mind, let it go.  Ho ld on to the relaxed state. 
You may want to meditate before doing crea tive work.  Creative ideas and solutions to 
problems may flow.  I have had creative br eakthroughs and complex technical solutions 
will just come to me while doing this.  Many of the best parts of this manual came during or after meditation, or while drifting off to slee p.  This gets you in touch with spirituality 
and some interpret this as God speaking.  
I find I have to immediately write the idea down on paper or I'll forget it.  Obviously, 
this can be a real distraction.  So unless you have an extraordinary memory, you may be 
faced with this choice.  But after all, it's a great choice to have to make. 
Each time that you have a calmed mind that is free from chatter and free from the 
racing, mental meandering of monkey mind, howev er short, you are living life your own 
way. 
128 Surely the meditation described here, along with the nutrition, exercise, nutritional 
supplements, etc. all work together to this end.   So the next time your mind is abuzz, quiet 
that monkey mind and make it your friend.  
Some people have reported a feeling of being detached from the body while in a 
meditative or spiritual state. 
 
Yoga 
Please see the exercise section on page 8 for a discussion of the benefits of yoga. 
According to Swami Vivekananda: Combining all of the yoga methods-techniques in 
their original context yields  a power greater than the su m of the individual methods. 
That's because while yoga is a very powerful system of Stress Management, these tools 
were designed for something much greater-as tools of transformation. 
The yoga techniques: stretching, deep re laxation, breathing, and visualization 
techniques-are powerful tools not  only for "stress management" but also for helping us to 
learn to open our hearts to our feelings and inner peace. 
Thoughts connect our heads; f eeling connect our hearts. 
Altruism, compassion and forgiveness-openi ng our heart-can be powerful means of 
healing the isolation that leads to stress, suffering, and illness. 
Now, I avoid getting into a power struggle with people. I just provide them with 
information so that they know what their opti ons are and then can make informed choices. 
And, I support whatever they choose. 
There is nothing you can do or get that will bring you lasting peace and happiness! 
Lasting peace and happiness are not something we get; we have them already until we 
disturb them. In that sense then, acting "selfl essly" is the most "selfish" way to behave, 
since it maintains our sense of inner peace and joy. 
The purity of the feeling-even a negativ e feeling has the po tential for being 
transformative if properly guided. The intensity  of negative energy can be directed into 
something more positive. 
That which you meditate on you begin to manife st in your life. To the extent that you 
(I) can have compassion for your (my) own ignorance and your (my) own darkness and inner demons, than you (I) can begin to have  the same compassion and love for other 
people whenever they display their darkness to you (me). 
Fear creates inner walls that keep our heart in darkness. Th e ongoing process of 
learning compassion-for my own darkness and that  of others-is what helps to free me from 
my sense of isolation. That's what frees us, th at's what heals us, and eventually, it may open 
our arteries as well as our hearts. 
Pain and suffering, whether in the form of physical illnesses like heart disease, or 
emotional diseases like severe depression, or spiritual pain, like hatred, can be profoundly 
healing. The goal is not simply to reverse the anatomical blockages, the real issue is how 
we can feel more free and more joyful. How to  open our hearts on psychological levels to 
build intimacy-and spiritual levels-to devel op compassion. More precisely, we are free 
already; by remaining compassionate, we can  stop binding ourselves and limiting our 
freedom. We may live longer because of this, but that's not the primary goal. We can live better. 
129 We can use our pain-emotional or physical-a s a catalyst to begin healing, not just 
curing. To me, "curing" means only getting back  to the way we were before we became 
diseased. "Healing" is when we use our pain or  illness as a catalyst  to begin transforming 
our lives-healing our inner pain and our re lationships, our hear ts and our souls. 
-- Swami Vivekananda (1896) Juana Yoga 
 
Another Application of "Once An Hour" 
Get an inexpensive watch with a pleasant chime that beeps once an hour.  Each time it 
beeps, clear your mind, relax, meditate fo r a brief period.  Remind yourself of how 
important it is to relax, how damaging the stre ss is, and how important it is that you're 
happy and feel great. 
 
Feel it Flow 
Feel the joy flow up from your heart.  Ma ke everything you do and everything you look 
at bring you joy.  Hold that f eeling -- if you "force" it for a wh ile, even 20 minutes or so, 
soon it will become hab it and a part of you. 
 
Decide to Wake Up Happy 
When you go to bed set the idea in your mind that you will wake up happy – and that 
you will not allow any negative thoughts to en ter your mind.  Also, sometimes just laying 
around in bed after waking up can lead to gr ogginess and depression (at lease for me 
anyway).  
 
Anytime, Anywhere 
This one is a combination of a relaxation and meditation method.  It may be a little 
difficult to maintain, but it can be very e ffective whenever and wherever.   You can 
experience very positive effects any time of th e day or night by just breathing deep from 
the diaphragm, relaxing all the muscles and the body and the putting your thoughts on hold.  
Do any body movements   s l o w l y  -- as slow as possible. Just continue to relax all the 
muscles in the body.   
Breathing "from the diaphragm" means you feel  the lower part of the lungs filling up 
with air first as your tummy goes out, then up through your chest as the lungs fill.  Exhale 
in reverse by letting out the air from the top down.   The heartbeat automatically slows with 
each exhalation.  Perhaps repeat the phrase "r elax the body all day long, relax the body all 
day long" over and over.   Within a few mi nutes you will experience of greater comfort, 
calmness and clarity of mind, more refreshe d and unwound.  Continue to relax, whatever 
you're doing.  It gets easier as each minute pa sses.  If you can keep this up for about 20 
minutes, your mind should be clear and you should be feeling great.  When you get to a point where you can do this all day long, no ma tter what your activity, you'll know you've 
got it made. 
A great variation of this that works to star t off the morning is to slowly repeat to 
yourself "Relax the body, breathe deep, rela x the body, move slow" again and again.  One 
statement whould take about eight seconds.  Or  substitute the things you need to do, like 
"Relax the body, breath deep a nd right, relax the body, have good posture".  Make up your 
own.  Remind yourself when you go to sleep (a nd write yourself a note) to do this first 
thing in the morning.  
 
130 Take a Walk  
Take a nice long walk while focusing your attention on things in the distance, like 
houses, trees or scenery.  Feel the solidness of the trees, buildings etc. This will relieve the 
stress of living in an internal world. 
 
Take a Vacation  
And here's a tip that will work fantastic for you: take an vacation!  About four days is 
the time that it takes to replenish depleted brain neurotransmitters.   
Or occasionally take at least an entire day to just stroll around places you enjoy or lie 
on a beach doing absolutely nothing in particular.  Or just stay in bed.  OK, I know that in 
real life you may have many important respons ibilities, and children or others who may 
need your attention.  But couldn't you find just one day each week just for you?  Don't be 
tempted to turn on the computer, or make just  a quick hop to the store, or whatever -- you'll 
just keep going and do more.  And you'll find th at the next few days you'll get a lot more 
done that you would have had you worked st raight through -- and you'll feel better.  
 
Johnny's Big Day Off -- You Can Have One Too  
After working about 11 days straight I noti ced I wasn't taking my own advice and was 
starting to get way stressed and worn.  So  I went over nearby Huntington Beach, CA and 
sat drinking a cup of green tea, then just strolled up and down the sidewalks, beach and 
pier.  
I came upon the Huntington Beach Surf Mu seum, a fun place that brought back 
memories.  And there was a concert by the "C hantays", a five piece surf band rocking the 
crowd with a 40" mural with su rf and surfers, miles of cr ystal white sand and California 
beach babes as a background (OK, I just imagin ed the beach babes).  I forgot to ask, but 
what the heck is a chantay?  It's interesti ng how fun things appear  for you, and how much 
better ordinary things seem, when you're in the right relaxed frame of mind.   
Then, my mind and work took on new clarit y and energy and passion that I hadn't felt 
since, oh, about 11 days before.   
Enough of Johnny's big day off.   Go design your own.   
 
Important Note: Don’t get carried away by your new superpowers. 
Just what do I mean by that???   And what’s it got to do with  s t r e s s ? 
When I first started feeling all supercharged  with this system, I got extraordinarily 
ambitious and started working day and night  on some projects.  But I wasn’t paying 
attention to how hard I was working and my st ate of mind and had gotten into a spiral of 
stress that undermined the very goals of the sy stem.  When I stopped the stress it got better.  
So pay attention to how you ’re doing, and stay loose. 
 
And this probably won't pertain to you, but as  an aside, I noticed that after a while on 
this system I would become just a little more impatient, irritated or ups et with the kinds of 
people or situations that are easy to become  impatient, irritated or upset with.  More 
buttheads seem to magically app ear.  This may be a personal plight with just me, and the 
result of misdirected energy.  A powerful racecar  takes some time to learn to control. As 
this can be a negative spiral, so stay in  control and don't let this happen to you.  
 
131 Who Wants to be a Gazillionaire? 
Is an ultra-fast paced go-getter materialis tic millionaire lifestyle worth it?  Is the cha-
ching  of the cash register of greater value to you than happiness? Are dollars (or your 
favorite currency) the measur e of your life? In The Ov erworked American, Harvard 
economist Joliet Schor reports th at since the late 1960s, the average U.S. worker is putting 
in the equivalent of one month more each year .  But today lots of highly paid, overworked 
workers are trading in there hi gh-powered occupations for le ss punishing jobs, but at lower 
salaries.  Lawyers are purchasing and tending vineyards, investment bankers are opening 
bed-and-breakfasts, consultant s are going into teaching. 
Are you working really really hard, but maki ng more money just to spend it?  Sure, on 
this system you will find that you have the ability to work longer, harder and smarter in your work, thereby increasing your ability to make money.  But consider how much better 
the quality of your life might be by working le ss hours but in a more focused and smarter 
fashion. And consider how much more you c ould make for each hour of your time.   
Think of how much more mone y will come to you in those extra years, decades, or 
even centuries if you stick can just around to  earn it?  You purchase money with your time 
and expertise.  You decide whether or not the price you are paying for the money, in terms 
of body, brain, peace of mind (in short, your own flesh) is a good deal.  
There are those who, rather than having an interest in finding ha ppiness and conscious 
raising, prefer a matter of fact approach using financial tools like cost benefit analysis, ROI 
and the like.  So how much more money will you make next year by being more creative, 
thinking outside the box, and being receptive to opportunities?  How much will you save on insurance premiums with the reduced risk of getting sick?  If you get a disease that 
could have been avoided or de layed, how much put cost you to treat the disease, and how 
much would you lose by being away from work?  Or if you feel that sooner or later you'll 
get sick anyway, what's the time value of that money by delaying the cost?  How much 
more we be up collect on that retirement or  pension by sticking around a little longer?  If 
"stuff" is your thing, think of how much more  stuff you'll be able to accumulate.  Decide 
what measure is important to you, th en run your own numbers for yourself. 
A red traffic light, the hourgla ss on your computer, a long wait  in a line or the sands of 
time do not mean "stop" -- they mean "rest". 
See the appendix for more information on reducing your overhead and living simply. 
 
Got Happy?  
"People are as happy as they decide to be."   -- Mark Twain 
OK, another stupid "got whateverTM" tag line.  But isn't happiness what it's really all 
about? So what is happiness?  Joy, an inner feeling of balance and contentment, pleasure 
out of daily living?  But for most people it needs no definition.    
No matter what your station in life or how  much stuff you have, if you're happy then 
you're better off than someone with higher position and more stuff.  
Happiness means different things to differe nt people.  For one person it could be 
complicated balance of having pleasure a nd avoiding pain.  And maybe adventure, 
challenge, and service to others are more im portant than joyous happiness to another.  
Factors like wealth, fame, and good fortune have  been associated with happiness.  And 
sure, poverty is associated with misery.  But beyond a certain level of  resources, increased 
132 affluence adds little to happiness.  Winning the lottery would definitely make us happy for 
a while, but eventually we would cal m down to our habitual level. 
It's so important I'll say it again -- The pr ecision, scientifically designed  nutrition and 
high-performance exercise methods, appropr iate amounts of well-designed nutritional 
supplements, stress reduction, and other methods found in this manual will do a lot to improve your mental well-being.  Sometimes th ey will bring immense results.  When your 
body, brain, and mind are tuned up wo rking as well as they can, don' t be surprised if things 
that have upset you or problems that have dogged you no longer matter and just float away.  
Mood swings resulting from insulin highs or blood sugar lows, protein, neurotransmitter 
and nutrient deficiencies can be resolved, as well as fatigue, stress, hormonal shifts. 
This will bring you more joy and happiness,  more energy, a clearer mind with better 
concentration and improved problem solving ab ilities, a more carefree approach, fewer low 
points that don't last as l ong as they once did, and a renewed enjoyment and spark of 
enthusiasm for life. 
So go forth and make happy.  
 
If You Need Help 
This is not a mental health program, per se .  What follows are some little methods to 
give you a lift and bring cheer, and even provide some amusement.  But if you are 
regularly depressed, sad, angry, confused, frustrated, resentful or scared, you won't 
just want something to reduce the intensity of your problems so that you can function 
the little better in the world.  You want to eliminate the source so you can function 
fully in the world. 
Psychological counseling may offer you this.  Volumes could be devoted to do locating 
a counselor who could best help you. As with  any form of professional help you will want 
one with a lot of experience.  You will want to screen about a dozen. There are numerous 
kinds of therapies and one kind of therapy may be better for you than another.  The 
counselor you feel most "comfortable" with ma y not necessarily offer you the best or right 
kind of therapy for you, or even be all that good. Antidepressants or re laxants, under expert 
medical guidance may or may not be right fo r you, but they are worth considering. For 
some people short-term antidepressant therapy w ould be the best thing to temporarily help 
bring them out of the slump, and for others ev en lifelong antidepressa nt therapy would be 
appropriate after other avenues ar e shown not to work.  Also, a Course in Miracles  can be 
an instrumental in resolving deep-seated issues.  There were be the sec tion devoted to this 
later. 
 
Some Characteristics of Happy People 
Happy people have some things in common, acco rding to expert on happiness David G. 
Myers, PhD, who surely must be a darn ha ppy guy himself.  In his book "The Pursuit of 
Happiness: Who Is Happy-- and Why" he discus ses how satisfaction with income, family 
life and friendships are important, but satisf action with self ranks higher.  Happy people 
like and accept themselves, they have high se lf esteem.  Also, happy people tend to be 
optimistic and expect the best, as well as bei ng social and outgoing people.   And maintain 
close relationships.   
Dr. Joyce Brothers advises to share your feelings, successes and failures with friends 
and loved ones.  Initiate new relationships and nurture old ones.  Cultivate a sense of gratitude for the many, many good things you ha ve in your life, and frequently give 
thought to them. 
133 Angus Campbell remarks that the nationwid e surveys conducted by the University of 
Michigan show that happy people have a sense of control over their lives.  And they fill up 
their time with meaningful activities.  They do things to take control their situations. 
You can reverse engineer your happiness by doing these things 
until they become a habit. 
 
So here are some ideas to give you a lift and bring cheer, and maybe even 
provide some amusement.  
 
Think Positively 
Think positive thoughts, push negative thoughts out.  
 
Cultivate Optimism 
Actor Lorne Greene who played the patria rch Ben Cartwright in the TV show Bonanza 
used to do a news broadcast parody where he  would announce all the floods, fires, and 
earthquakes etc. that did not happen that day.   
Optimism is the expectation of a positive ou tcome, a cheerful hopefulness.  Cultivate 
optimism and try to expect the best.   
 
Gratitude 
Comparison is of great value in happiness.  Take a few minutes at  the end of any day 
and try to think of all the good things that have come your way and all the blessings you 
have had.  You are sure to come up with a long list -- much longer than you expected. Take 
a few moments to consider the poverty, famine and natural di sasters that you didn't endure 
today.  
 
Laughter is a Great Medicine 
Get a joke book and read some jokes (there  are some great joke web sites and Email 
joke lists.  Get together with your friends or  your dog and tell some jokes.  Really yuk it up.  
Watch a funny program or rent a funny video.  Ma ke up some jokes -- they don't have to be 
very funny, just look at some of mine.  Laughter  actually stimulates the emotion center fo 
the brain called the limbic system.   It is he re that endorphens are re leased that produce the 
sensation of pleasure and well-being. 
See the appendix for more information on jokes on the web. 
 
Sweet Dreams 
Your body repairs organs and tissues, pr oduces immune cells, grows new bone, and 
produces growth hormone while sleeping.  So  if you're not sleeping, well, you're not 
repairing organs and tissues, producing as ma ny or as much immune cells, bone and growth 
hormone.   
Sleep deprivation can throw your immune sy stem of whack and accelerate your aging.  
Cortisol (that really bad hormone) increases, a nd insulin response (the ability of your cells 
to allow the entrance of glucos e in response to in sulin) decreases with sleep deprivation. 
Drowsiness can result in accidents.  And feeling sleepy all day is no fun. 
134 Researchers at the University of Chica go found what appears to be a link between 
middle-age spread and sleep patterns as th ey get older. Men produce growth hormone 
primarily during deep sleep. The researchers f ound that the quality of men's sleep decreases 
with age along with the body's production of  growth hormone. The drop in growth 
hormone, in turn, is thought to lead to flab. Six months of growth hormone injections have 
reduced body fat 13-20% in growth hormone de ficient adults.  However, growth hormone 
is very costly 
So the researchers are working to see if new types of sleeping pills or hormone 
injections can improve sleep, thereby slowing the signs of aging. If deep sleep can be 
increased, growth hormone production will also increase. 
Some common causes of insomnia are stre ss, depression, stimulants (caffeine or 
nicotine), herbal supplements or over-the-coun ter medications, alcohol, medical problems, 
and a change in environment, time zone or work schedule.   
Implementing this system, particularly the exercise, will he lp you sleep better, 
naturally.  At one time in my life I would wake  up in the middle of night about 4 or 5 times 
a week and not be able to get back to sleep for an hour or more.  Now that is very rare, 
maybe once every 3 months or so. 
Ideas for better sleep include maintaining a regular routine and going to bed at a regular 
time,  keeping the bedroom dark, not smoking before bedtime (better yet -- not smoking ever), and avoiding naps or strenuo us exercise just before bedtim e.  Soft sheets of at least 
275 thread count are very comfortable. Maintain adequate  ventilation, and a comfortable 
temperature and level of humidity.  A comforta ble bed with clean sheets can be soothing.   
Too much caffeine too late in the day may keep you awake at night.  Caffeine after 10 
AM increases your stress level by speeding up your biologic clock.  Thus giving you, in 
effect, a much longer day. 
Use your bedroom only for sleeping, meditati on, nighttime reading, a nd of course, great 
sex.  This will help you associate your bedroom  with relaxing and sleepiness, and maybe 
with fun.  Go to bed and get up at roughly the same times each day, even on weekends.  A long, hot bath or shower before bed can be s oothing.  Read a magazine or book just before 
nodding off.  But avoid suspenseful or overly dr amatic materials.  Instead, read something 
amusing or uplifting --the kinds of things that  quiet the mind.  I've been noticing a lot of 
violent television programming, pa rticularly on cable, during th e hour or so just before 
bedtime.  Even the late TV news dwells on the worst of human nature -- police blotter 
kinds of stuff.  This can be engrossing, but can also put your mind in a stir and reduce the 
quality of your sleep.  Who needs dreams wher e you're being chased by criminals or in the 
middle of a disaster. 
Sounds that you may not even notice or have  become used to, like a television in 
another room or traffic, can pr event you from entering the deep pa rt of your sleep cycle.  If 
you can't avoid it, then moldable ear plugs can help.  Be sure to follow the manufacturer's 
instructions, and don't get them stuck in your ear. 
Plant a thought in your mind that will be pr esent when you awake.  For example, the 
idea that you will remain calm and free from stress all day long. 
One form of sleep inducing meditation is to breathe deep and repeat  to yourself “Relax 
the eyes, relax the face (while relaxing the eyes and face), rela x the head, relax the “another 
body part that needs relaxing” (move from toes to  foot to ankle, etc with each repetition). 
Relax them "past" the point of just being relaxed to where every tension is totally released. Breathe deep from the diaphragm with each breat h and exhale slowly.  Feel the heart beat 
135 slower with each exhalation.  This is a kind of like meditation, but now it's okay to fall 
asleep.  Repeat over and over as you relax these body parts.  Listening to a relaxation tape 
that guides you through this proce ss can really help unwind the mind. 
Tell yourself that you're going to sleep sooner or  later -- so it might as well be sooner.  
This will relieve the self-imposed pressure of  feeling you have to drift off, and you will 
further relax. 
Centuries ago the Chinese developed anothe r form of sleep meditation.  Close your 
eyes and imagine a small wheel turning inside yo ur head just above the center of your eyes.  
I prefer a waterwheel, with the water symbo lizing the flow of life.  Chant the word 
"ahhmmmm." 
Melatonin is a powerful neuro-hormone secret ed by the pineal gland in the human brain 
that is associated with  our natural sleep-wake cycle. It can be very helpful in getting a good 
night’s sleep and for insomnia.  Melatonin is a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin. It must be used moderately and wisely.  Se rotonin production decreases with age. During 
the day, our melatonin levels are very low. But at  night they rise drama tically, apparently in 
response to the fading light.   
 
Melatonin supplementation is not for everyone.  Not everyon e is low in serotonin.   
Only if you need it, use small amounts of me latonin – only as much that is needed to 
help you drift off.  
Too much melatonin can cause depression. 
You do not want to flood the brain with too much melatonin.  I take about 1/6 mg each 
night at bedtime.  I open up a 3 mg capsule, and place 1/6 of the contents and (1/2 mg) under my tongue for rapid absorption.  
If you are like me, a short while after taking the melatonin you may notice an 
aggressive feeling, or even a little anger.  If this is the case, ta ke less in the future. 
If you wake up in the middle of the night to  whiz because of all the water you're now 
drinking, it would be a good time to have a sma ll meal.  As previously described, the body 
doesn't store protein, and will even take it fr om stores in your muscle and organs, (i.e. 
disassemble you), even when you're sleeping.  I usually have one of my small meals then. -
- also some antioxidants. Saliva doesn't flow much when we're sleeping, so you'll need to give the teeth another quick brus hing.  You may or may not want  to take just a little more 
melatonin under the tongue -- prob ably less than 1/6 of the c ontents of the capsule (less 
than 1/2 mg), as it may cause you to be groggy upon waking. Personally, I do NOT need or 
take any melatonin in the middle of the night lik e I this.  Do the “Relax the eyes, relax the 
face . . . " meditation described above.  Upon doi ng these I go back to sleep fairly quickly, 
sleep deeply and wake up really refreshed.  A nd, it will really help you sleep.  Is waking in 
the early morning hours issue problem, perhaps even setting an alarm at 1:00 or 2:00 am 
and doing the above would be worth a try.   
Sweet Dreams. 
 
Behavior Modification and Motivation 
Using phrasing of your choice, use the "Once an Hour" and "Big Bang" methods in the 
Chapter 9 to get happy.  
 
How do you cook a monkey? 
136 First, you coax him into a kettle of moderate ly warm water with, say, a banana or a nice 
girl monkey.  He's happy, so you turn up the heat ever so little.  He doesn't notice a thing.  
Then up the heat just a tad, then a tad more.  He  still doesn't quite notice, but he's just not 
not as happy as at first.  Keep upping the heat and voilà -- your monkey is cooked.   
Animal activists, take note: This is just an example of what can happen to any of us.  I 
am not actually advocating the cooking of our simi an friends. I have never, ever in my life 
turned up the heat on a kettle of live monkey, or any other livi ng thing, not even a lobster.  
I believe animals have feelings and I advocat e the rights of animals on many, many issues.  
This is just an example of what can happen to a person who gets into a situation that's 
comfortable and satisfying at first.  Then a litt le of the reward is taken away or a few more 
demands are made.  More taken and more demanded and so on, until you feel like you're cooked.    
So learn to recognize when this  is happening to you -- Jump out of the kettle and flee.  
If there's a situation it your lif e that's repressive dragging you dow n, try to fix it.  And if the 
situation involve something other than, say, your  child or another personal responsibility 
that you really must to stay with, just get out.  If you must stay with it, then do was much of 
this system as you can for now, and pick up the rest later. These situations will be more 
easily recognized, and solutions will be mo re apparent with the fine tuning you'll 
experience from this system. 
 
Know what to change and when to change it 
Happiness can be a balance between accepting things the way they are and making 
some changes.  Take a look at what needs to be changed in your life -- your job, 
relationships, living situ ation, and the like.  Then take action to make what changes are 
necessary for greater happiness. 
 
Stonewall It 
Push unwanted thoughts out of your mind. The mind makes no distinct ion as to what’s 
real and imagined.  A positive mental outl ook will come easier with your body, brain, mind 
and spirit are operating as well as they can be with the use of this system.  Optimism will 
come more naturally. 
Eliminate thoughts of frustra tion, anger, resentment, depression, thoughts of what you 
should have said, that bozo who cut you off on the freeway, what someone said to you at 
work, and even fear . . . sound familiar?   Throw them out of your mind!  You have no 
place for them. 
Throw these thoughts out – and if they try to return, don’t let them get a foothold.  
Replace them with thoughts of love, joy and peace, thoughts of good things and good 
people who have graced your life, an d thoughts of your favorite things.  
Admittedly, this one can be the most difficu lt under normal conditions.  But if you have 
been under extraordinary pressure (whether “r eal”, or self induced and unnecessary), you 
may have reached that point of motivation where you’ve really, really had enough. This 
will change your life.  You will be  amazed at the value of this. 
Yes, ugly thoughts can be like old friends and hard to part with.  But they're not your 
friends – in fact, they are destructive a nd they tear your mind and your body down.  And 
you the have the choice in designing your own ment ality.   It’s difficult at first, but as you 
continue and gain momentum it becomes a posit ive habit.  So drive out all bad thoughts, 
137 thoughts of things that go wrong, thoughts of ange r, how you have been hurt or betrayed . . 
.  starting now.   
 
The Happy Blast  
This one is just a quick fix and really doe sn't solve any underlying problems, but it's kind 
of fun.  So for a quick positive charge (e specially when something goes wrong) I use a 
swinging little mantra I call the HAPPY BLAST and it goes like this: 
"I feel happy, I feel goo d, I feel happy, happy gooed,  
I feel happy happy good good, really happy happy good. . .  everythings going to be just gr eat, bad is gone good is in,  
hippy happy good good    ah-woo woo woo . . . "  etc. 
After about 20 minutes of th is I get real happy.  Just  make up what suits you.  
 
Try the accompanying happy walk.  Or for a really good time, do the happy dance. 
 
Last thing at night, first thing in the morning 
What are the first things you think about wh en you first wake up?  Probably all the 
things you have to do, rehearsing for what you will say to someone, or worrying?    
For a few minutes, make the last thing at nigh t and the first thing in the morning filled 
with positive thoughts. Remind yourself that th roughout this day, and in every day, there is 
no place in your heart for anger or worry, or an ything else that will disturb your peace.  
Is it worth the aggravation to let your e go win some minor battle, but damage your 
body with all the stress that it takes to get it?  
Consider the beauty of nearby trees and gra ss, how a seed melds with the earth, water 
and air to become a flower, the beauty and power of love. Maybe even put on some easy 
listening or soothing classical music to  further set your tone for the day.  
To help remember in the morning, the very last  thing before going to sleep at night is to 
remind yourself to do this  upon first awakening. 
 
Personal Growth 
There are lots and lots of books and tapes on self-improvement, self-help and spiritual 
awakening available to you from an array of s ources.  Everyone is different, so try some -- 
explore and find what works for you. "A Cour se in Miracles" is among the best. Wayne 
Dyer's "Manifest Your Destiny" offers spiritu al principles to help attract what you want 
into your life. For me, it was instrumental in  bringing about a greater sense of harmony 
with the world.  It's available in a book and on tape, with an accompanying meditation tape. 
Deepak Chopra's "The Seven Spiritual Laws Of Success" combines physics, 
philosophy, spirituality, Eastern wisdom, and we stern science for a fulfilling guidebook to 
discovering one's potential.  And Anthony Robbins offers lots of methods for rewiring your 
brain for success and happiness, as well as reduc ing the pain in one's life.   For example, 
his method of listing what you have to gain and lose can change unwanted behaviors and 
patterns. I have used these with excellent  success.  These methods are available in 
"Personal Power II" by Anthony Robbins. 
These are a few of the great materials out ther e, this list just scratches the surface.  
Don't be gullible, but continue to learn a nd grow, physically, ment ally, emotionally and 
spiritually.

Personal Relationships 
A study of 22,000 men and women at the Univers ity of Michigan s howed that people 
with few close relationships were two-to-four ti mes more likely to die in a given period of 
time than those with a strong network of frie nds. This demonstrates how relationships can 
help us handle stress. 
One study of elderly heart attack patients found that those with two or more close 
associates enjoyed twice the one-year survival rate of those who were completely alone.  
Relationships require time, cultivat ion and sometimes a little understanding 
 
Your Career 
My excellent pal of over twenty years, "C aptain" Rick is a high energy, movin' on 
down the highway of life kind of guy, and a budding musician and songwriter.  He's always 
eager to master new skills and take on ne w adventures.  Twenty years ago he would 
describe his dream of becoming a pilot.  Su re enough, through hard work and persistence 
he is now a pilot for a major airline.  P iloting a 727 can be immensely challenging and 
rewarding.  There's just one problem though, it's just not his cup of tea and it's a mismatch 
for his personality type. 
A happy work life is vital to health and antiaging.  "Have a job you love and you'll 
never work again" is a phrase we sometimes h ear.  One minor problem with that is that the 
world often places little value a nd won't pay money for us to do what we love.  Consider 
"Find something you like a lot that for sure th e world will pay for, and do other things you 
really love in your spare time, and you can still be really happy".  Or maybe "Find a way to 
make your present career fun and rewarding".  The Behavior Modifi cation and Motivation 
section can help with all this. 
If you are considering a new career, take pe rsonality tests to find what's really a good 
fit.  Research the opportunities and occupati onal categories.  There may be options of 
which you're not aware.   
Beware of inflated claims of market opportunities by educational institutions and 
companies selling training programs.  Resear ch the market thoroughly, talk to graduates 
and companies that might employ you. 
Here's a occupational retooling success story:   Everyone seems to immediately love my 
dear friend Amy.  When she enters a room full of strangers she is soon the center of 
attention.  And she has a profound love for animals -- dogs, cats, raccoons, llamas, you 
name it.  She was successful as a legal secret ary for 12 years, but wanted to move to a 
career with not only more opportunity, but also  where she could make more meaningful 
contributions to the world.  At first she considered something along the lines of a 
psychotherapist (one aptitude and personality test suggested the option of "ward nurse") .  
One problem is that it takes many years of st udy, then on to usually  unpaid internships, 
then a long time to build up a practice.  And it takes a special kind of  person to listen to 
other peoples' problems all day long.   Many people b ecome disillusioned and unhappy 
after making such a great investment in time and money only to find that it was fun while 
learning, but the day-to-day job is not for th em.   Anyway, legal secretaries know a lot 
about the inner workings of the law and le gal processes and the like, and often train 
attorneys fresh out of school as to what the law is really all about .  So I suggested she 
become a lawyer.  At first she was stunned w ith disbelief and just didn't think she had 
what's needed to be a "powerful attorney" t ype.  But over time the idea grew on her and she 
139 enrolled in night school.  Today she's a ha ppy (and "powerful") attorney and frequently 
takes on and resolves animal cruelty cases.  A nd recently she took about a 1/3 cut in pay to 
have a lower pressure position with work that she loves and a firm that really appreciates 
her. 
And all is well for Captain Rick.  His pres ent occupation supports him and his family 
well, and it affords him enough spare time to research and start new businesses. 
 
Come Up for Some Air 
Imagine a zeppelin that’s all crunched over and only able to be partially inflated.  Do 
you think it would ever get o ff the ground?  OK, another dumb  analogy.  But this is how a 
lot of people live their lives – all hunched over and depriv ing themselves of the oxygen 
necessary for your youthful joyous life.   
Every part of our bodies needs oxygen on an  ongoing basis, as well as to eliminate 
carbon dioxide.  
Deep breathing also helps reduce stress, as we ll as reduce the urge to overeat.  You may 
frequently catch yourself breathing shallow or even holding your brea th, especially when 
under stress.  This causes more damage to the body and brain by depriving them of the 
necessary ongoing resources.   Re solve to “catch yourself in the act” and always practice 
better breathing.  Soon it will become a habit.  
Get in the habit of sitting or standing up straight, and breathing from deep in the 
diaphragm as described in the re laxation and meditation sections. 
 
Deep breathing exercises? - NO! 
While correct deep breathing throughout the and while meditating is important, 
"health" and "therapeutic" breathing methods c onsisting of repeated de ep breaths, often in 
the hundreds of unnatural breaths, is dangerous and should be avoided.   
 
Spirituality, Faith, Prayer and Health 
Having your body, brain and mind in tune and wo rking at their peak with this system 
can do much to improve your spiritual recep tivity and help you fo rm your own spiritual 
connection.  The "body as a temple" is the co rnerstone of many reli gious beliefs.  Although 
this is not a spiritual program, per se, when your machinery is in optimal working order, it 
follows that you will be more spiritually aware,  and be better able to form a spiritual 
connection.  You will have higher conscious ness and a greater understanding of, and 
capacity for, spirituality and for making contribut ions to others and to the world, as well as 
make better judgments between what is real and the ones that are illusion. 
Spirituality is a personal con cern and is subject to indivi dual interpretation.  It is 
difficult to find agreement on exactly what it is.  In an article named "Leaping Lamb: 
Investigating the Spiritual ity of Children" in the July/August 2000 issue of Science & 
Spirit, K. Helmut Reich points out that although no concensual definition exists, some 
categories constitute the core of spiritual ity: achieving personhood, existential awareness, 
being-in-relation, a sens e of the sacred, and so on.  So me view religion as part of 
spirituality, others view spirituality as part of  religion, and others sa y that spirituality and 
religion are distinct but overlappi ng.  He says that perhaps sp irituality could be considered 
as not simply extending  but transcending  the biological.  In addition to religious 
spirituality, we can speak of the spirituality of art, music, es thetic appreciation and so on.  
140 Religion does not go hand-in-hand with spirituality.  Spirituality is completely separate 
from religion.  Spirituality is being aware, and listening to your essenc e, which is part of 
God.  Religion can be a way to bring people together to collectively do good and keep on 
track, and it can contain dogma and ritual.  One can be very religious, but completely 
lacking in any spirituality -- e.g. religious extr emists and fanatics, persecution and religious 
oppression, hatred, intolerance, inquisitions, to rture and other inhumane acts such as wars 
brought on by religious fervor.   
And in "First Impressions: Evidence of a Hard-Wired Spirituality", David Hay notes 
how the overarching theme, coined "relationa l consciousness", referred to an intense 
awareness of relatedness -- either to God, to ot her people, to the and garment and indeed to 
the self.  He also describes how language is  ill-equipped to give adequate expression to 
spiritual life. 
A study in the May issue of Health Psychology  entitled "Religious Involvement and 
Mortality: A Meta-Analytic Revi ew" reveals that religious involvement is associated with 
higher odds of survival (or, conversely, lower odds of death).   Dr. Michael E. McCullough 
and his research team summarized the findi ngs of 42 different studies examined the 
relationship between religious i nvolvement and longevity to a rrive at this conclusion.   
As Wayne Dyer describes in Manifest Your Destiny , a lot of people th ink of God is a 
kind vending machine.  They put in coins in th e form of prayers and hope to get what they 
want in return.  This has never worked for me .   Dr. Dyer also stresses the importance of 
the relationship of the person to the world in spirituality. 
Dr. Harold Koenig, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of 
religion/Spirituality and Health assurances that religion is relevant to health.  He and his 
colleagues have found that people who attend ch urch regularly are hos pitalized less than 
those who never or rarely partic ipate in church services.   
People who pray and read the Bible have lower blood pressure and stronger immune 
systems.  Health benefits are higher in thos e with a greater level of religious involvement. 
Other research in the field has shown that th e devoutly religious are less likely to suffer 
heart attacks, and religious cance r patients have less anxiety.    
The religious people tend to avoid alcohol abuse, risky sexual behavior and other 
destructive habits.  Also, and affiliation with a church may be practical in terms of support 
systems were even catching a right to the doctor. 
The National Institutes of Hea lth has just funded a five-y ear project to measure how 
prayer alters the natural neur oendocrine mediated immune protective mechanisms in breast 
cancer patients.  Neuroendocrine markers, and T, NK cell and lymphocyte immune cells 
will be measured, as well as subjective percep tions of stress, psychosocial functioning, and 
quality of life. 
The above effects, however, are observations  and not double-blind crossover studies.  
Others, including Dr. Lee-Benner have conducte d surveys among dying cancer patients and 
found emotions to be only a very weak contributor , if at all.  So the point is -- stay in as 
good of condition as possible and do what you can to avoid disease or diagnose and treat it 
early. 
 
"Why does man look for a God? Why does man in every nation, in every state of 
society, want a perfect ideal somewhere, eith er in man, in God, or elsewhere?-Because that 
idea is within you. It was your own he art beating and you did not know; you were 
mistaking it for something external. It is the God within your self t hat is impelling you to 
seek Him, to realize Him. After long searches here and there, in temples and in churches, 
141 on earth, in heaven and in hell, at last you come back to your own soul, completing the 
circle from where you started, and find that He  whom you have been seeking all over the 
world for whom you have been weeping and pr aying in churches and temples, on whom 
you were looking as the mystery of all mysteries, shrouded in the clouds, is the nearest of 
the near, is your own Self, th e reality of your life, body, and soul…By means of spiritual 
discipline the individual soul ultimately recognizes its onen ess with the Universal Soul." 
-- T.S. Eliot, Four Quarters 
 
Forgiveness 
For a long while I was in proximity of a bi g burly bearded personality with a booming 
voice and an ever expanding midsection.  We'll call him "Barney".  It can take some time 
and effort to find forgiveness for mere minor offe nses such as his -- we want to get to point 
where forgiveness comes natural fo r the greatest of offenses.   
With average height, the bulk of his midsec tion could fill a doorway. He can be affable 
and at times rather charming, and knowledgeable  on a great many things .  A pillar of civic 
responsibility and weekly churchgoer.  But wh en you are in proximity for a while, another 
Barney steps out.  This one's a strange butthead,  a bully and a self-centered child. He'd start 
to move with a kind of roly poly studly strut and you could detect a mean glint in his eye.  
When he's around it's somehow noisier. There's te nsion in the air, and at times, a lot of 
cursing which would upset the children.  Y ou feel somehow jumpy.  Not when you first 
meet him, though. At first there's just polite conversation, but if you were paying attention, 
a faint suspicion of an odd and overbearing presence.  
Barney seemed to take pleasure in toying w ith others.  One of his jolly games was to 
bushwack me from behind while I was absorbed in some activity, booming his trademark "YOOOO!". Variations on this in cluded bellowing, blitzkreig "f riendly conversation" or an 
enormous belch. Madcap fun for him, but after a couple of dozen times, absolutely 
unnerving for the subject. Made me jump out of  my boinkin' skin lots of times until I got 
smart and learned some evasive maneuvers.  This  silliness persisted despite repeated pleas 
in various forms to just stop. 
More antics: Once Barney came barreling down a hill in his car on a dark night when I 
couldn't have known it was him.  He swerved to  the opposite side of the road where I was 
standing and hit the brakes, st opping just short of me. A fright.  And once I was helping 
him with a piece of portable furniture.  He  was familiar with the operation of this 
equipment, but just must have forgotten how  the spring-loaded leg assembly would shoot 
outward with a  resounding schoick  sound unexpectedly, and with great force.  I was in 
luck, though.  It missed my eye by a good three inches.  
A couple of times when I didn't display appr opriate interest  in some long and involved 
paper he had written, he bumped me off my feet with his exce ssive belly.  But I had a soft 
landing, so no harm, no foul. 
He once casually informed me of the parki ng ticket I was about to receive all morning, 
but 20 minutes after it had been placed unde r my windshield wiper. He'll let out huge 
belches and pass gas just about anytime a nd anywhere, and has even subjected his 
extremely thoughtful and generous wife to this at  the dinner table.  He  turned up at a couple 
of singles get-togethers when wifey was out of town, and on ce bragged about the crude and 
ridiculous way he had recently propositioned a former girl friend. 
One appalling event I once witnessed was when, for no apparent reason, he told his 
visiting step-granddaughter "I'm really glad you ca me to visit. So I can spank ya." Yes, I 
142 alerted his wife to this meanness and was prep ared to take further action. No, I've never 
witnessed any such spanking.  But the sound of bushwacked children with a huge 
"Arrrrrrrrr!", instan tly followed by little shrieks or a feebly admonishing "Ohmygosh!!" 
still rings.  Spawning a new generation of bushwackers. 
My anger, resentment and distaste were kept  pretty much in check.  But a little dread 
would swell up from inside when I would h ear him coming, and I st arted looking over my 
shoulder a lot.   
But of course, Barney's obnoxious antics are no t in nearly the same league as physical 
abuse, rape, taking the life of a loved one and other transgress ions of the kind that others 
endure and forgive.  
Carrying around hateful and loathing bagga ge undermines your own mental and the 
physical well-being.  Maintaining "attack thoughts" is an attack upon yourself.   
Forgiveness will bring you healing.  It will  lift a burden from you and bring peace.  
Forgiveness will allow you to see the good and not the ugly, and redesign the world in 
which you live.  
Along with prayer, forgiveness is a fundame ntal component of mental and spiritual 
health and can produce beneficial  and healing effects.  This doesn't mean leaving yourself 
open for more abuse or even staying around an abusive person. 
Robert Enright is professor at the Univer sity of Wisconsin-Mad ison and president of 
the International Forgiveness Institute.  In a study among elderly females, Enright, along with researcher John Hebl found a significan t decrease in depre ssion and anxiety among 
those who participated in a forgiveness pr ogram (although the contro l group did experience 
some of the same benefits).  Furthermore,  the researchers found th at the elderly women 
who participated in the study not only used forg iveness skills to rec oncile with a single 
person, but "also to consider more deliberatel y forgiveness as a social problem solving 
strategy". (F1) 
My friend Adam is a writer with high amb itions of breathing life into dreams.  He 
affirms: "Holding anger, grudge s or attack thoughts will eat you alive.  They can bring 
down your health, your state of mind and your  effectiveness at work.  Let 'em go. 
Regarding snappy and aggravating people, we should feel bad for them because they're 
stuck with such sour attitudes and are awfully unhappy.  If we just treat them pleasantly it 
just may lift their spirits, as well as ours."  
Here are just a few methods:  Say that you forgive the person aloud, using their name.  
Or write them a letter of forgiven ess.  You don't have to give the letter to them.  Or see the 
person in your mind and try to perceive so me light within them, and a spark of goodness 
somewhere.  In your mind make him or her your friend.  Remember that you aspire to a 
level of living and freedom that is beyond su ch negativity.  "A Cour se in Miracles" and 
other texts can help you with this.  Also, the "Once an hour every hour" and "Big Bang" 
methods in the Behavior Modification and Motivation section will help get negative 
thoughts away from your mind and replace them with more positive mental activity. 
Surely you have known a Barney.   He seems to be mellowing in recent years, though. 
Increasing health problems must be taking the wind out of his sails. And I suspect, a great 
loneliness.  
See the appendix for more information on forgiveness. 
 
When Things Go Wrong 
143 When things go wrong, ask " what's the lesson here?"  Try to learn from it, and don't 
compound the problem by getting yourself all worked up. 
 
Love in the Streets 
As you walk down the sidewalk or drive dow n the road in your car, imagine sending 
love to every person and everything you pass.  You'll be surprised at how uplifting it will 
be for you, and how much better you'll feel about the world. 
 
Potpourri 
Envious of others and their posessions/friends/love live/[fill in the blanks]?  Well don't 
compare yourself with others -- consider what you have and how great you are.  Besides, 
they've got their own set of problems.  Lack  confidence?  Minimize your risks, ask ask 
"what's the worse that could happen."  Chances  are you could live with it.  Mourning a loss 
for too long?  Embrace the mourning for one day.  Go ahead, cry, do nothing, whatever.  Then absolutely put it behind you and move on.  Been living up to others' expectations?  
Free yourself -- so what if you disappoint someone  else?  Worry too much?  Take action to 
free yourself from worry.  Just start on the very  first thing, then the next, then the next.  
Make a list, take action.   Over committed?  Do some things just for yourself.  Stressed?  
This entire manual will help you lower it -- in particular, exercising twice a day as previously described, and meditation for around an hour on the days you might fall into 
particularly high stress.  
 
Meet Your Ego 
According to A Course in Miracles , your ego is the wrong-minde d attempt to perceive 
yourself as you wish to be, rather than as you are.  You perceive the world and everything 
in it as meaningful in terms of ego goals, which have nothing to do with your own best 
interests.   
The ego likes to run the show, and can cause us  an awful lot of grief.  It has a bag of 
tricks that it uses to try to stay in control. These tricks in clude conflict, c onfusion, illusion, 
dissatisfaction, self-preservation and fear. Sometimes it will cause you emotional distress 
for no reason just to try to show you it's influence.  
Egos often try to exploit situations and turn them into forms of praise for itself in order 
to overcome its doubts. It "gives to get".  Egos often clash, and some egos make 
themselves feel better by putti ng others down.  Egos can play lots of games for strange 
gratification. Like making inane remarks or vague insults to shake another up and draw 
them in, or watch them try to explain to them why they are so very wrong.   
The ego varies among people, but is universally  unstable.  It believes it is completely 
on its own. An ego will really fight to keep from  losing control to the (holy) spirit.  It can 
put you through hell to get what it wants. 
A Course in Miracles  and other psychological & spiritua l studies can help one drop the 
ego and live in spirit. 
Be free from the influence of the e go, and experience perfect happiness. 
 
A Course in Miracles 
A Course in Miracles  is a system of spiritual stu dy.  The curriculum is carefully 
conceived and explained, step-b y-step, at both the theoretica l and practical levels.  It 
144 emphasizes application rather than theory, and experience rather than theology.  It requires 
"a little willingness" and when going through it you normally study one lesson each day.   
A Course in Miracles  is the result of a joint effort in a common goal by Helen 
Schucman and William Thetford.  They were  Professors of Medical Psychology at 
Columbia University's College of Physic ians and Surgeons in New York City. 
Chapter One offers 50 explanations, or principl es, regarding what a miracle is.  It's not 
quite the same as the dictionary definition of "an event transcending the known laws of 
nature due to supernatural inte rvention", like instantly healing the sick or raising the dead. 
But to my thinking it is just  as wonderful an expression. 
The idea is to train your mind in a system atic way through a different, and immensely 
better, perception of the world -- free from  the influence of the ego and in perfect 
happiness.  It is Christian in statement, but deal s with universal spiritual themes.  It stresses 
that it is but one version of uni versal truth.  There are many othe r paths that lead to God in 
the end and this one differs only in form.   
Some of the concepts include the elimina tion of preoccupation w ith past thoughts such 
conflict, illusion and fear, seeing peace and be ing at peace, eliminating "attack thoughts" 
and their effects on you, and bringing peace through forgiveness.  
Some of the concepts can be disagreeable or  even disturbing.  Your ego may throw up 
barriers and actively resist. 
We consider "A Course in Miracles" a "r equirment", although it is up to you when you 
are ready to take it. 
Like all good things, it requires time a nd commitment.  Although I'm still working on 
it, the course has help ed me clear out some erroneous and illusory notions from my 
thinking and brought me peace.   
Although there are a number of supplements to  it, the usual format is the combined 
volume and consists of a blue book of about 1000 pages.  There is a text, a workbook for 
students, and a manual for teachers.   
SO THIS IS IMPORTANT: If you do A Course  and Miracles, it is important for you to 
know that the workbook for students starts at the middle of the book -- And that's the most 
important part for you to study.  You probably wo n't want to start at the beginning, like I 
initially did and got pretty confused. 
 
Daily Word 
The Daily Word is a neat little book offering brief, three or four paragraph inspirational 
and energizing messages each day on a variety of topics.  Subjects include life's journey, 
forgiveness, amazement and inner peace. The Daily Word is available from the Unity Church. 
 
 
 
 
145 Chapter 7 -- Water 
 
"All diseases will surely be cured, even old age." 
Benjamin Franklin 
Your body is kind of like the city of Venice, where the 
roads are canals.  Water is th e transportation medium by which 
necessary materials (in your body, that's things like nutrients, oxygen, energy and waste) are moved into, around, and out of your city/body. Now imagine the Venetian canals with about 3 
inches of water. Yikes! Gro ceries going undelivered, stinking 
garbage piling up.  Gondoliers r unning aground, and they're not 
singing.  Things start to stagnate and sm ell really bad.  I know, yet another obtuse 
comparison.  But I really want you to reme mber to drink your water, because . . . 
Like temperature, ph (acidity), and the concen tration of molecules, water has an effect 
on how your body operates on a molecular leve l and how the molecular structures 
necessary for life interact  with one another.   
We could live without food for two months, but without water you'd die within days.  
Water aids in digestion and metabolism, maintains body temper ature, and lubricates your 
joints.  It is also necessary for maintaining muscle tone, washing out toxins and impurities, 
and water helps the kidneys filtrate wastes fr om your blood. Blood is 50%  water, so if your 
water content is low, your blood is thick li ke sludge.  Well hydrat ed blood moves more 
easily around obstructions. Water helps to maintain our body te mperature, and it is needed 
for weight loss because it is needed in order to metabolize fat.  Also, drinking water will 
help you feel fuller and the less inclined to snack.  And it even keeps the skin full and 
plump, so you'll be lookin' good.   
The thirst feedback system -- I call it the “thirstmostat”, ☺  sets lower with age.  So 
older people actually need more  water than they perceive b ecause they’re not thirsty when 
they should be.  
As previously mentioned, coffee, tea and cocoa drinks act on the kidney to increase 
urination, which limits their usefulness in fu lfilling the body’s fluid needs.  So they don't 
count as water.  In fact, they  are diuretic and dehydration-pr omoting so you'll have to drink 
a little more water to make up for them. 
75% of Americans are chroni cally dehydrated, in 37% of  Americans, the thirst 
mechanism is so weak that it is often mi staken for hunger, even MILD dehydration will 
slow down one's metabolism as much as 3% , one glass of water shuts down midnight 
hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters st udied in a University  of Washington study, 
lack of water is the #1 trigger of daytim e fatigue, a University  of Washington study 
indicates that 8 to 10 glasses of water a day could significantl y ease back and joint pain for 
up to 80% of sufferers, a mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term 
memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty  focusing on the computer screen, drinking 
8 to 10 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash 
the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to de velop bladder cancer. 
 
Medical Details -- and Follow Your Doctor's Guidance 
Review the "friendly" disclaimer at the star t of this manual. Have a complete physical 
exam (which is probably long overdue anyw ay) and get your doctors approval before 
implementing any of the ideas in this manual. 

146 Some examples of medical conditions wher e the a person would have to modify or 
limit the amounts of water they drink include congestive heart failure , renal insufficiency, 
impaired renal function, among others.  Some one who is on diuretics may have similar 
considerations.  Discuss this  with your doctor and follo w you’re his or her advice. 
 
Amount of Water 
Spread your water drinking out throughout the day.   If large volumes of water are taken 
in a short space of time it can provide short lived symptoms similar to being drunk.  And 
it's OK to have water (and nutri ents) with meals as it's not goi ng to significan tly dilute your 
digestive juices. 
If you’re into formulas, here’s one for wa ter intake:  (Approx.)  2/3 ounce per pound of 
your body weight per day (if you’re active, and I’m assuming you are because you’re 
following the exercise recommendations above),  spread thruout the day.  So for a 150 
pound person, that’s 150 x 2/3 = 100 oz.  So th at’s about 12.5 8 oz. glasses per day.  It 
works best to carry water with you, or keep it nearby.   
And if you’re not into formulas and making measurements, usually about an 8 oz. glass 
each hour for a 150 pound person will do just fine  -- a little more if you’ re heavier, a little 
less if you’re lighter.   Or just make it a minimum of 2 quarts a day, but about a gallon a 
day is best. 
 
Water Quality 
Like health food, there's a lot of controvers y regarding our public water supply.  Clean 
water proponents and bottled water compan ies say that more than a dozen known 
carcinogens, pre-cancer forming agents such as  toxic minerals, are found in small amounts 
in drinking water of some U.S. cities.  Many of these form as a result of the chlorination 
process that kills harmful microbes.  In recent  years, detergents, pesticides, fertilizers, 
industrial byproducts, other ch emicals -- like arsenic, merc ury, cadmium and lead -- and 
even nuclear wastes have begun to seek into  our water supply.  Thes e have either been 
discarded improperly, or come from industrial dumping, leaking storage tanks, landfills, or 
storm runoff.  Lead is also a serious problem , and excessive exposure can lead to damage 
to the nervous system, brain, kidneys and red blood cells -- and children are particularly at 
risk for lead poisoning.(Ref T1)   Although th ere is controversy whether small amounts of 
these pose a cancer threat, just to play it safe but I'll drink bottled over plain old tap water.  
Buying a small water dispenser and 5-gallon bot tles is probably the most cost effective 
pure water solution. 
 But if there's no bottled water around or if you just can't afford it, drink it from the tap.  
However, be aware that even in water bottl ed directly "at the source" from "mountain 
springs" have been shown to have unacceptabl e levels of cancer causing chemicals, like 
chromium 6.  There are tests available to dete rmine the level of these chemicals that have 
been ingested.  
What Goes Up Must Come Down 
After a few weeks of increased intake your bl adder should be able to carry more.  Now 
for a bit of practical reality: The urge to purge the water you drank an hour ago can come 
up on you with an urgency that is immense.  Yup, like a racehorse.  And I mean desperate 
and getting worse by the moment.  You will have two options -- and one of them is to explode.  At minimum it would be a source of great discomfort.  Or even the source of 
147 great embarrassment if you are out driving around or are in a meeting and really need to 
use a bathroom but can’t find one.  So plan accordingly.   
And if you are driving and really, rea lly, really have to go, no matter how 
desperately, continue to drive safely.  
Also, unless you don’t mind getting up from bed to march down the hall a couple of 
times each night, don’t drink water a couple of hour s before bedtime.   More reality: Still, 
you'll probably need to urinate at least once in  the middle of the night.  A guy can keep a 
jug at the side of the bed and just, well, kind of roll on his side -- you get the picture 
(dabbing the urethral area with tissue afterward can cause irritati on).  For a gal, this can be 
the little more difficult to nego tiate.   And you won't want to have to wake up early in the 
morning, and not be able to get back to sleep and miss out on your REM sleep.   So 
definitely planned your dr inking habits accordingly. 
When you are awake in the middle of the night, that would be a 
good time to have one of your protein powder and carb meals. Since nutritional supplements are best taken throughout the day, that would be a good time.  Be sure to need to give the teeth another quick brushing afterwards . You'll find that you will sleep 
deeply afterwards, and you'll a  pr obably dream.  Read the section 
on sleep for ideas on how to get back to sleep easily. 
 
The body needs adequate amounts of water for the nutrition and exercise, and 
other concepts presented here to work.  But this is the easiest to forget. This has 
happened to me.  After about six months I no ticed that I didn't have as much energy 
and vitality, and wasn't as happy as befo re.  I made a check of everything in the 
program, and found that the correct amounts of water were missing.  Learn from my 
mistake.   
So measure it if you must, but remember your water.       
  
 
148 Chapter 8 -- Nutritional Supplements and Pharmaceutical Intervention 
  
"Health is the first wealth." 
     Ralph Waldo Emerson 
Moderate and appropriate amounts of well-designed vitamins, 
nutrients and other nutriti onal supplements can be a va luable part of your aging 
intervention system. 
They should be coordinated with a comple te health, fitness, aging intervention, 
antiaging science and life enhancement sy stem which includes the  scientifically 
designed and precision nutrition and exerci se, stress reduction, risk reduction and 
other methods in this manual.    
Remember -- "Youth Doesn't Come In a Bottle "? -- or a syringe or patch or other 
delivery system. 
Still, it would take 20,000 calories of vege tables each day to fulfill your requirements 
for vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients. 
Vitamins are vital nutrients and organic subs tances that act as components of enzymes 
and coenzymes.  Enzymes are needed for spee ding up chemical reactions that take place in 
our bodies. Coenzymes help enzymes carry ou t their life-sustaining functions.  These 
chemical reactions are what control our body’ s very metabolic processes.  So taking 
vitamin supplements are needed for maintain ing good health, especially if there is a 
deficiency.  
You will find the vitamin and nutrient suggest ions found in these pages awfully tame 
compared to the outlandish claims, or recommendations for megadoses that have been made by some popular authors and lecturers.  The hazards of megadosing (taking lots and 
lots of vitamins) and combining megadoses of many different supplements are coming to 
light and is considered u nnecessary and dangerous by many reputable and responsible 
experts and companies selling nutritional s upplements. But many still offer a very wide 
range of questionable supplements and make outrageous claims. The effects of combining 
lots of different kinds of  supplements are unclear.  
The Physicians Desk Reference  (PDR) is a comprehensive resource with information 
on more than 1,000 prescription medications, in cluding side effects and possible food and 
drug interactions. There is a PDR for Nutriti onal Supplements to help  you separate fact 
from fiction.   It's available here:

149 First we'll discuss some of the negatives (and dangers) of inappropriate 
supplementation, then we'll go on to some guidelines and what works. 
 Some Questionable Marketing Methods 
As I write this I'm looking at an ad with cro ss sections of three ar teries -- the first is 
nearly clogged due to atherosclerosis, the s econd is only partially clogged, and the third is 
healthy and clear.  The ad's copy talks about wonderful restorative e ffects of the product.  
Maybe I'm a skeptic, but to me it implies th at this product will restore atherosclerotic 
arteries to healthy ones. 
Some of the "scientific refe rences" at the end of the ad  may include popular magazine 
articles, studies or letters in  journals of questionable sta nding, rat data only (data from 
experiments done on rats -- and although we sh are many biological similarities, rats are 
vastly different from humans), references that  are only distantly rela ted to the product, or 
talk about diseases that are di fferent than the one the product is said to improve, and even 
U.S. Patents.   They often reference the a dvertising or articles in their own publication. 
Often these articles often don't show the name  of the author or their credentials  -- 
respected doctors and researchers with a lot to lo se if their reputations were to be tarnished. 
There will sometimes be references to "clinic al trials" or "clinical  studies" or "clinical 
research".  Often there is no mention of the na mes of the researchers and institutions where 
they were conducted, and in which peer review ed journals they were published – who is 
putting their reputations and liv elihoods on the line?.  The de sign of the "experiment" is 
often not discussed.  Most likely it does not  conform to the gold standard -- randomized, 
double blind, placebo controlled, ideally at multiple locations. 
Some companies make no claims in thei r literature but rely on testimonials, 
encouraging people to try their products and credit them for any improvement that happen. 
Chances are the people giving testimonials are doi ng a lot of other things  that will affect 
their health, and the positive (or negative) changes may not be caused by the factor they 
think.  Some people just like to see their names in print,  and they may change their 
opinions over time after having more experience  and after the novelty has worn off.   Often 
testimonials are entirely fictitious. 
And all this is complicated because many prom oters sincerely believe in what they are 
doing, whether it is true or not.   And ofte n information about proper nutrition, exercise, 
stress reduction and the like are completely igno red.  It could be argued that they're not in 
the business of nutrition, exerci se, stress reduction and shouldn't be expected to offer 
information on anything other than  their products, any more than  a car dealership should be 
expected to give you information on other pr oducts, like how to buy house.  But health 
issues involve a different, and higher, standard of ethics. 
Some ads for nutritional supplements will co ntain a vague reference to "people" or 
"scientists" making an endorsement.  Like "T here are many people who believe scientists 
have found the way for us to reach age 80, 90 or  100 in excellent h ealth and vigor. It's 
known as human wakinol . . ."   Or claims  may be couched in a question, like "Can 
polyurethane extract make you perform like you're  a twenty year old stud muffin again?" 
(assuming you ever could), and so forth. 
It's been said that if you want to boost sales of a product, te ll people it will:  
- Make them rich.  - Burn fat.  - Get them sex . . .  
150  
SEX sells 
. . . not just cars, clothes, ci garettes and booze, but health products as well.  One  recent 
ad I noticed is for a vitamin potion depicti ng what could only be described as a goddess 
come to earth lookin' for whoopee.  She appears very to be hot for one of us ordinary looking mortal type guy who just happens to  take a particular  kind of nutritional 
supplement offered by the company.   
And this morning I just happened to noti ce an advertisement w ith a gray-sprouting, 
manifestly middle-aged man who looked really really happy, and maybe a little disoriented.  
He was locked in an amorous embrace with a beautiful, and much younger, babe -- er, I 
mean young woman, who seemed to be really enjoying herself as well.  I would have 
mistaken her for his daughter!   
The unspoken pledge is the same as endless ot her pledges in modern advertising: "Buy 
this, get that". 
It is well known in the public relations bus iness that an editorial in a newspaper or 
magazine is many times more believed than an  advertisement. So so me of the nutritional 
supplement companies will pay someone with cr edentials to write an article and make 
claims for them. This person may be selling th e supplements in his or her own practice.  
The "research" is often based on data that is not genuine and certainly does not comply 
with the gold standard of research: randomized, double blind, placebo controlled research study -- ideally conducted at mu ltiple locations and published a peer reviewed medical 
journal.  And conducted by scien tists who are experi enced and respected in the scientific 
community -- and with a lot to  lose if their reputations  were to be tarnished. 
Sometimes authors and other proponents of nutritional supplements either have their 
own lines of vitamins to sell you or are aligne d in some way with th e  people who will sell 
you vitamins.   Vitamin companies are prohibited from directly making therapeutic or 
extravagant claims themselves in product lite rature.  Some companies run this risk, hoping 
that the government won't take action until their customer base is well established.  Often 
promises are couched in subtle pseudo-medical  jargon, or in weasel words like "appears to" 
(even though the statement may come from a le gitimate scientific source) that create an 
illusion of a promise. 
Danish scientists have studied the differences  in effects between groups that receive the 
medication being studied, as well as a placebo and no medication at all.  They found that 
the improvements in the patients who received  a placebo and no treatment were often the 
same -- leading them to wonder whether people who improve on placebos would do as well without any medication. 
Or the "results" may be based on "in vitro" (in glass -- [in the la boratory]) experiments 
with cell cultures or the like that are done in a test tube or similar laboratory container.  
Things are many times more complicated in  the human body.  Or the research may be 
based on rat data that is extr apolated to humans.  There is  a great amount of scientific 
literature with examples of chemicals that we re first shown to be safe an effective in 
animals and then found to be ineffective and/or toxic in humans.  
On the other hand, some substances deemed  hazardous are based on studies where huge 
amounts of it were fed to rats that devel oped cancer, and small amounts would probably be 
safe.  Rodents deal with oxida tive stress in ways that are fundamentally different and less 
effective than humans, and th ey have longer telomeres. 
151 There is little research having to do with the effects of a combination of different 
nutritional supplements.  Or recommendatio ns may be out of the context of a 
comprehensive system that is practiced on a da ily or lifelong basis.  Often presentations are 
unbalanced, and contain little or no informati on regarding vital exer cise, nutrition, stress 
reduction and the like 
And guess what comes after the scientific ar ticle in their magazine?  An ad for the 
product.  I'm not saying that that is necessarily  bad -- some of the ar ticles are informative, 
deep and insightful, and based upon good scientif ic research.  People need information to 
make an informed decision about purchasing pro ducts.   But often the references include no 
information on the efficacy of th e product they're actually selling. 
Psychosomatic symptoms (defined as a reaction by the body to tension) are often 
relieved by anything taken along with a suggestion that it wi ll work. Tiredness and other 
minor aches and pains may respond to any enthusiasm accompanying a product that does nothing in itself.  For these problems, even  physicians may prescribe a placebo. A placebo 
is something that has no pharmacological effect  on the condition for which it is used, but is 
given to satisfy a patient who believes it to be a medicine.  
 
Response to an Inquiry 
A personal trainer contacted me once to ask what I thought of some nutritional 
supplements with scientific sounding names th at he was selling.  He also asked about 
telomere shortening.  I did some research, a nd spend a good amount of time to give a very 
thoughtful reply to his request.   
I wrote back and said I'd be interested in knowing why someone would need the first 
three specifically, and why a ppropriate nutrition wouldn't s upply enough of them.  In a 
brief web search for some of them I found some unsubstantiated, bogus sounding statements -- and little or no talk of the im portance of nutrition, exercise, stress reduction 
etc. -- and how to do them -- accompanying the claims.  I obviously take a very dim view 
of a lot of supplements, and of companies that  do not tell the complete  story regarding the 
importance of nutrition, exercise , stress reduction, etc.   I also offered my opinion of the 
role of telomeres in aging along with some resources. 
After the time I spent and some useful information I provided, I expected some 
communication in return, or at least a "thank you" -- but never heard from him again.  It 
became clear that he was trolling for distributors. 
 
Megadosing 
Regarding megadoses, perhaps they would wo rk for some individuals and for some 
specific conditions.  But there is  little scientific evidence th at megadoses work under most 
conditions, and many vitamins and nutrients are toxic in even modera te amounts.   This 
risk rises exponentially when combining me gadoses of different nutrients.  Over-
supplementation, and using the wrong supplements , can carry potential side effects and be 
hazardous to your health. Megadoses of many mi nerals, trace elements or vitamins can be 
toxic, and can overload your body or block the actions of other nutrients. Free radical 
activity and oxidation are necessary in some forms and too many antioxidants can be counterproductive to your good health.  
I was once taking a lot of, and I mean a lot, of antioxidants.  I t ook what is called an 
oxidative stress test available from a company called Genox.  It revealed that the amount of 
oxidative stress (a measure of oxidation, or  free radical damage) in my body were not 
152 particularly low.  This is probably because  the antioxidants I wa s taking were of poor 
quality, as well as the truth that in  most people megadoses do not work. 
 
Just a few examples of the toxicity and ill e ffects of overuse of some over-the-counter 
nutrients: 
 Vitamin A can cause liver damage, and cerebral edema which can be fatal! 
 Antioxidants could cause fatigue and muscle weakness. Although Vitamin E 
supplements increase stamina, there's a point  of diminishing returns -- and after that 
Vitamin E can be toxic. 
 Too much zinc suppres ses immune function. 
 Vitamin D can contribute to hardening of  the arteries, liver damage and kidney 
damage.  
 Vitamin B6 can cause irreversible nerve da mage.  It took me about a year for the 
tingling and numbness in my right hand to go away. 
 Iron can raise "bad" (LDL) cholesterol. Middle-aged men and women should avoid 
multivitamins that contain more than 15 milligrams of iron. Having too much iron 
in the blood can put people at risk of can cer, diabetes and heart disease. Several 
studies have shown that people in indus trialized nations w ho regularly donate 
blood, thus depleting iron st ores a bit, have a lower risk of heart attack.  
 For those who are prone to calcium oxalate  kidney stones (the  most common kind) 
high doses of Vitamin C will break down into oxalates.  (Also diet must be modified)  Vitamin C oxidizes and becomes a free radical agent. 
 Everyone is different -- so me people are sensitive to particular supplements. 
The ingredient "thymus" in a dietary or herb al supplement might be thyme, or it might 
be lymph tissue from a cow.  Other raw animal meat may also be hidden in the supplement.   
Dr. Scott A. Norton, a Maryland dermatologist, wrote in a letter to the editor in the New 
England Journal of Medicine that because these "natural" supplements are essentially 
unregulated by the federal govern ment, many contain a variety of  animal tissues that could 
spread illness such as Bovine Spongiform  Encephalopathy (BSE), otherwise known as the 
mad cow disease we've been hearing about in Eu rope.   Eating meat from an animal with 
the disease is believed by scientists to cause a  new form of BSE.  A similar fatal brain-wasting affliction  that has ki lled more than 50 people in Britain.  However, no case of BSE 
has ever been  found in the United States.  Yet.  
And here's another example of suppl ementation that can be misapplied: 
androstenedione supplements are made of a naturally occurring st eroid hormone the body 
uses to make testosterone. The supplement had been used by home-run king Mark McGwire did raise his levels of  testosterone.  Researchers sa y that men who are past their 
prime muscle-building years can't count on andr ostenedione to help them build muscle.  
And a recent study found that the supplement raises the risk of health problems. " Andro  
didn't raise testosterone levels enough to trigger the male horm one's muscle-building 
capacity in men ages 30 - 56 y ears," it said.  Meanwhile, "level s of the beneficial form of 
cholesterol known as HDL fell," the study sai d. Researchers looked at blood samples taken 
once a week over 28 days from 27 men who took 100-milligram capsules of andro three times a day. Results from the men on andro we re compared with those of 28 men who were 
given inactive substitutes. The men on andro developed increases of 40 - 50 percent in free 
testosterone levels in thei r blood. In a similar study, men 35 - 65 years of age showed no 
153 benefit from andro, even when they did high-in tensity strength training.  Chronic andro use 
also lowers libido and erectile function. 
As previously discussed, prescription medications, and even over-the-counter 
medications, cause nutrient depletions resul ting in nutritional deficiencies. This is 
particularly true for the elde rly and women (particularly t hose taking estrogen).  People 
who take a lot of antibotics, such as ch ildren, are also partic ularly at risk.   
In some cases nutritional supplements can increase the effectiveness of prescription 
drugs.  
Most multivitamin/mineral formulas sold in stores are over two years old by the time 
they are bought off the shelf from the time of manufacture. Also these ingredients are 
usually a mixture of "natural" and processed products. They are made as inexpensive as 
possible. 
Recently scientists have found that s ynthetic compounds are purer and more 
completely absorbed by the body than the so-called "natural" products. For example 
"Natural" Vitamin E Oil capsules are rancid because they cannot be protected from 
oxidation in the oil form.  Vitamin E does not become an antioxidant  until it crosses the 
intestinal membrane and becomes chemically changed from the Ester form through hydrolysis to the free form. The only safe way to take Vitamin E is the synthetic form which is a pure crystalline powder. 
When you approach a nutritional and antioxidant system, it is important to keep in 
mind that we are biochemically individual.  This personal regimen is  not a blueprint for 
you, but rather an example of what worked for me. I offer it as an example to guide other people to help them find what will work for them. 
 
"Smart" Pills 
"Smart" pills are vitamins, herbs, & drugs ar e alleged to increase intelligence, improve 
memory, & prevent brain aging.  True, there are some smart pills that will preserve your 
brain and increase mental abilities like creativity  and memory.  But most of them should be 
taken in small amounts at the most. There ones that will damage you -- so not a smart thing 
to take.   
For example, St. Johns Wort is an herbal supp lement sold in health food stores. It is an 
antidepressant with powerful e ffects upon the brain. St. Johns Wort should not be used -- 
not even under "expert" guidance.    Also, stay away from all herbal stimulants before a 
workout, and at all times.  These include St . Johns Wort, yohimbe, ma huang, ephedrine, 
ephedra among others. They can cause dangerous ly high blood pressure and irregular heart 
rhythms, and result in death. 
The supplements recommended in the for im proved brain and nervous system Tier 1 
basic system in this manual are proven to be effective by scientific research.  Small doses 
are recommended.  A vast majority of people taking them feel more alert, happier and 
experience greater mental clarity.  Still, everyone  is different.  So if  you begin to feel not 
right, for example like being unusually agitat ed or "revved up", or overthinking an 
unfavorable situation that may arise, or feel  subdued, or notice anyt hing negative that is 
unusual about the way you feel, discontinue them  for a day or so, then try smaller amounts 
of them one-at-a-time to fine tune your system to find out what works best for you. 
As an example, choline is a dietary precurs or to acetylcholine in the central nervous 
system. It has improved memory and learning in normal subjects and is considered an 
154 essential component of a suppl ement program.  If you become depressed, choline is the 
most likely candidate to reduce. 
So discuss it with your physician, and pay at tention to how you feel and be aware that 
you may have to fine-tune your system as l ong as you are on an antiaging system and as 
long as you are taking supplements. . 
 
Hormone Supplementation -- Growth Ho rmone, Testosterone, Estrogens, 
DHEA  
Some of the conditions and diseases that  middle aged people begin to experience, 
including abdominal weight gai n, depression, and pros tate and heart disease, are directly 
related to hormone imbalances that are corr ectable with availabl e drugs and nutrients. 
Hormone supplementation can improve mood, alertness, libido, and skin and muscle 
tone in both men and women. 
For most people, human growth hormone (o r hGH, GH, HGH) Testosterone, estrogen 
DHEA and other hormone levels le vels drop dramatically by age 30.  This is only part of 
the picture. The simple, and often wrong, solution  to the decline in pr oduction and aging is 
to take hormones. 
 
Human Growth hormone (hGH)    
Human growth hormone has been getting a lo t of publicity lately. There is a lot of 
misunderstanding and misinformati on regarding hGH.  Its effect s can be very positive, but 
many people mistakenly believe that all you have  to do to be young again is inject hGH, or 
spray something that has been marketed as hGH (but is not) under the tongue.  Others 
would have it as the first thing they would do in their system. 
The effects of inappropriat ely administered hGH and other hormones, like other 
nutritional and hormonal supplements, can be hazardous to your health.  
People who are not deficient in hormones do not need to use them.  In fact, supra-
physiologic (more than the physiological amount) hormone replacement hormone 
replacement is harmful, even lethal! 
"Growth hormones and testoster one are indicated only for actu al deficiency", confirms 
Paul S. Jellinger, MD, president of the Americ an Assn. of Clinical Endocrinologists. "The 
issue gets complicated in th e context of anti-aging medici ne. Patients are asking about 
supplements and hormones, and doctors have to be well-informed."   
Often it is an entirely inappropri ate form of anti-aging therapy.  
Also , some preliminary data from studi es on animals shows th at although growth 
hormone can improve the apparent quality of  their lives, it shor tens them somewhat. 
Most doctors are not well informed about  this -- despite wh at they say about 
themselves.  The use of hGH -- which is a brai n hormone -- is a field best left to the sub-
specialty of endocrinolo gy.   You should definitely be unde r the care and supervision of a 
neuroendocrinologist. 
Growth hormone is secreted by the anterior portion of the pituitary gland located in the 
base of the skull.  A hormone is a kind of ch emical produced by a gland, that is secreted 
into the bloodstream and controls  the function of distant cells or organs.  Mention the word 
hormone, and sex hormones like testosterone  or estrogen, often come to mind. 300,000 
nanograms or more of hGH per day are required to do any good.  
155 hGH production, like neurotransmitters and many or most other hormones, declines 
with age.  hGH secretion begins to decline after you reach full growth, at the rate of 14% per decade., and is reduced from a peak of about 20 ng/ml to around 2 ng/ml. After the age of 50.  (ng = nanogram, or 1,000,000 gram).  Decreased production of growth hormone is responsible for the frailty and fragility of aging, produced by poor body and muscle tone, weight gain and immune function decline. 
Growth hormone is quickly 
metabolized, and only present in the bloodstream for a few minutes, so it is not easily measured directly.  It is responsible for intracellular transduction signaling for protein metabolism.  Its effect is 
to signal the liver to make a series of "growth factors" which 
may be the actual ones that repair  the cells.  IGF-1 is one of the 
more stable ones, because and it remains detectable in the blood 
for a 24 hour period. There is not a direct relationship between 
growth hormone and IGF-1 in the blood, so you cannot measure 
the effects of hGH is by measuring the IGF-1.  However, it is used as a measure to indicate excessive effects of hGH. 
The relationship of growth hormone with other hormones is 
complex, and growth hormone pr oduction is controlled by a 
complex feedback system.  hGH depends upon another hormone and is inhibited by somatostat in (growth hormone-releasing 
hormone), which is secreted by the hypothalamus. hGH is released in a pulse-like fashi on, 6-8 times  a day and most 
prominently during deep, slow wave sleep which occurs about an hour after you fall asleep.  
A simple, and often wrong,  solution to 
declining hGH producti on that accompanies 
aging that is performed by many inexperienced practitioners  is to put a patient 
on hGH.  Unfortunately, there are many other considerations, such as changes in hGH receptors, the patient's unique physiology, interactions with other hormones, and many others. 
There is a feedback system, so the body 
decreases or shuts down natural production.

156 Natural hormones produced by the body are usua lly better. And hormone receptors (the 
sites on the cells that are activated by the hormones that produce the desired responses) 
typically decline with age, along with the m achinery and the cells that communicate and 
make use of the hormonal messages.  All this  complicates things, which is part of the 
reason why the supervision of a neuroendocrinologist is needed. 
Growth hormone costs around $800-$1200 per month. If you have a whole lot of 
money, hGH might be a good idea -- if you need it  But most folks would have to work extra hard for more hours, and subject of themselv es a lot of wear and t ear (stress) to make 
that extra money to be able to afford it sin ce most insurance companies don't want to pay 
for it.  And by putting in all those extra hours you might be tempted to slack off on the 
exercise, food preparation for necessary nutriti on, meditation, and other key components in 
this system. This trade-off just wouldn't be worth it.  
Measures of aging include muscle, bone, orga n and fat mass.  The first three decrease 
with age, and as most of us know by now, fat tends to increase -- particularly intra-
abdominal (visceral) fat (a ca rdiac risk factor).  Growth  hormone supplementation can 
partially reverse this.  The size and number of  muscle cells, and the rates of protein, DNA 
and RNA synthesis within muscle cells, are sensitive to GH.  hGH also has important 
effects on the functions of most  organs, including the liver,  kidneys and lymph system.  
Adequate growth hormone rel ease is necessary for proper T- cell (a kind of immune cell) 
production.  Thus, the decline in the body's gr owth hormone release results in immune 
system decline.   
Growth hormone treated patients have had si gnificant improvements in quality of life 
scores on standard psychological tests of en ergy, and emotional reactions to stress, and 
social isolation.  This hormone is one of th e most studied and well researched.  There are 
40,000+ peer reviewed scientific articles resear ching the effects, efficacy, safety, etc. over 
the past 35 years.  This does NOT mean that all use of  growth hormone is effective or 
safe.  
The most common side effects of hGH in adults are edema (fluid retention) and 
arthralgia (joint pain) or myalgia (muscula r pain).  Also, carpal tunnel syndrome, initial 
bone loss, increased insulin resistance and possible cardiovascular disease. These are 
usually dependent upon the dosage.

The Rudman Study  
A landmark hGH study was performed by Dr. Dani el Rudman et al in 1991.  It showed 
how a small group of people with advancing age (who were experiencing a decrease in lean 
157 body mass and the increase in mass of adi pose [fat] tissue occuring with aging) 
experienced a decrease in fat and an increa se in muscle with HGH.  As previously 
discussed in the section on protein, the reduction of lean body ma ss reflects atrophy in 
skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, spleen, skin, and bone. 
This study examined 21 healthy men from 61 to 81 years old who had plasma 1GF-1 
concentrations of less than 350 U per liter during a six-m onth base-line period.  A six-
month treatment period that followed. In this group, lean muscle mass increased 8.8 percent, there was a 14.4 percent decrease in  adipose-tissue mass, and a 1.6 percent 
increase in average lumbar vertebral bone dens ity. There was no signifi cant change in the 
bone density of the radius or proximal femur.   Skin thickness increased .1 (1/10 of 1) 
percent.  
Here's a link to the Rudman study: 
http://www.bio-corp.com/growthb.html  
But based on this study, there has been a su rge of entrepreneurial physicians, who had 
no previous training in endocri nology and less insight into  neuroendocrine mechanisms, 
who began using "cookbook formulas" of "anti- aging hormone replacement" cocktails.  
This includes offshore brands of growth hormone, because U.S. pharmaceutical companies under the scrutiny of the FDA will not provi de it to Doctors who are not qualified 
endocrinologists -- skilled in diagnosis and treatment of growth hormone deficiency 
(GHD).    
 
Sublingual "hGH"  
It is important that you not confuse real growth hormone with sublingual (under the 
tongue) sprays.  Sublingual "hGH" is a product that is sprayed into the mouth or under the 
tongue, and is said to contai n real hGH (human growth hormone) that is supposedly 
absorbed under the tongue or through other parts of the mouth.  Often the ads will make 
inflated claims about the benefits of real h GH and describe the characteristics of another 
molecule called insulin-like gr owth factor-1 (IGF1), and it is difficult for the novice to 
determine that this is  not the product they ar e actually selling. 
Real growth hormone is produced by sophist icated genetic engineering methods.  It 
must be kept refrigerated, and is injected.  Sublingual sprays, usually synthesized from 
vegetable sources, are not real  growth hormone and they do not work .   
This graphic breaks out 
the different hGH amino acids by color.  The mucous membrane can pass molecules up to four amino acids wide (four colored sections in the diagram).  It demonstrates how sublingual "hGH" could not be absorbed, even if it were in the proper 3-D (folded) conformation that it needs to be in order to work. 
In the graphic of hGH, 
each amino acid in the chain is represented by a different 

158 color.   The distance between the arrows is r oughly the width of the openings in the mucous 
membrane -- four amino acids.  HGH cannot pass through an opening this small. 
hGH is a large, fragile protein molecule w ith a molecular weight of 20,000. It contains 
191 amino acids in an exact sequence. The molecule is folded and twisted on itself 
repeatedly. It is held in an  exact three-dimensional confi guration by fragile cross linkages 
between branches of this very large molecule .  It works on cell recep tors like a key in a 
lock. Its activity in the body depend on it be ing in an exact, comp lex configuration.  
Creating it in a lab for inject ion requires the use of very expensive equipment and 
meticulously preformed recombinant DNA technol ogy.  hGH from any other source than a 
human, even from other animals, will not work in a human. There is no other source of hGH (i.e. "plant source").  hGH must be made  using human genetics. The only safe form of 
hGH is made by splicing human genes into plan t cells and then multiplying those cells in a 
culture media.  A protein molecule as larg e as hGH cannot penetrate membranes to any 
significant amount.   Most of real hGH would be wasted if used in a nasal spray or orally.  
During storage and shipping hGH must be ve ry carefully freeze-dried under a vacuum 
to become a powder. Even the powder must also  be kept refrigerated to maintain activity 
for more than a few months. The hGH molecule  loses potency very rapidly when dissolved 
in solution. Even if the chemical formula remains exactly the same, any change in shape means hGH will not work.  Those cross-linka ges described above break very easily and 
become unstable soon after dissolving in soluti on. Only with refriger ation can biological 
activity be maintained for up to two weeks. Th at's how fragile the molecule is.  So its 
activity cannot be maintained in a liquid spray (if indeed th ere is any HGH present)..    
Ways to partially absorb some drugs through the skin have been developed. But this 
works only for small, non-protein molecules. In sulin is a protein molecule only half as 
large as hGH. If it were po ssible to absorb that kind of  hormone by mouth, by spray, or 
through membranes, millions of people with di abetes would not need to inject insulin.  
Dr. Chris Heward, of Kronos Science Laboratory, recently tested several of the more 
popular oral (sublingual spray)  hGH preparations to determ ine their hGH content.  The 
labels claimed that the products contained 2000 ng/serving (or 5,000 ng/ml, i.e. 1 serving = 
3 sprays; 3 sprays = 0.5 ml).  Test Result: None  of the products tested contained more than 
2.4 ng/ml hGH (less than 1/2000th of the amount cl aimed on the label).  The fact is, hGH is 
NOT absorbed through the oral mucosa anyway, nor is it absorbed through the GI tract. Even if it were, the amount of hGH in these prod ucts (if present at all)  is insignificant.  The 
normal average hGH concentration in the serum of patients stimulated with GHRH is in the 
range of 20-30 ng/ml.  Assuming that (a) hGH is  found only in the serum (it isn't), and (b) 
the average volume of serum is about 5 liters (5,000 ml), then the to tal amount of hGH in a 
typical normal patient is about 125,000 ng (25 ng/ ml X 5,000 ml).  Since, hGH secretion is 
intermittent (not continuous throughout the da y) the total amount secreted per day in the 
healthy adult is between 300,000 and 500,000 ng. 
Thus, even if the products tested  
(a) actually contained the hGH cl aimed on their labels and  
(b) were 100% absorbed through the oral mucosa or GI tract  
a single serving would contribute less than 2.0% of the amount of hGH normally needed 
for a meaningful physiological response.  A mo re accurate estimate based on average total 
body fluid volume is probably at least an order of magnitude less.  In  reality, practically 
NONE of the hGH in these sprays makes it to the appropriate receptors.  Thus, they are of 
no medicinal value.  Claims to th e contrary are simply not true. 
159 An anti-aging M.D. once sole me a popular br and of sublingual "hGH" spray at a cost 
of $120 -- and then an IGF-1 test ($40) whic h proved the sublingual spray did absolutely 
nothing to raise my IGF-1 level. 
The bottom line: reported benefits of "hGH"  sprays are apparently the result of the 
placebo effect.  Reported benefits of these sp rays coming from people who are trying to 
sell you the stuff are apparently place bo, fueled by the profit motive.  
 
My Experience with hGH 
For about 18 months I was fortunate to be  enrolled in a clinic al study conducted by 
Pharmacia-Upjohn Co using their brand of hGH, Genotropin. The benefits of this system I 
described to in the introducti on were written about before th is time and without hGH.  I 
was doing absolutely great without hGH.  However, on hGH I'm pleased to report 
noticeable, sometimes significant improvement s in mental well-being, performance and 
energy. It seems like I was even less interested in my worst vice of sw eet and gooey treats.  
Sometimes when looking at the clouds or a s unset, or when walking and feeling a slight 
breeze against my face, I felt kind of the same as when I was in my twenties.  But this 
happened a lot without hGH.  Although my  first musical choice is classical, The Rolling 
Stones  sounded real good again. And although I had often thought a bout digging out my 
old skin diving equipment and going diving again, I never really did it -- until then.  
Sex was definitely, well, sexier.  Sometimes it was 
Va-va-va-voom! 
Although I've been driving Volvos for a few years, 
there was a rekindled attr action to the Jaguar XKE 
roadster -- you know, the one that looks like it's doing 120 mph while sitting at a cu rb?  Don't worry, if I get 
another one I'll always wear my seat belt and drive like a 
gramps.  No more smash- ups like the last one. 
But I will also say that I sometimes tended to become 
more upset or angry over they kinds of situat ions and people that ag gravate, mistreat or 
cheat. 
Alas, it's inconclusive as to whether my own improvements on hGH are a result of only 
the hGH, or to some other positive changes a nd reduction of aggravation that I've made at 
about this time.  Or were these changes made as a result of a cleare r mind and greater as a 
result of the GH?  Or a little of each?  Such are the problems of interpreting anecdotal data. 
Anyway, my own improvements are not near ly as profound as some books and reports 
would lead you to believe.  At prices of around $12000 per year, I don't know whether I'll 
continue hGH after this study.   Probably depends on how many of these darn books I can 
sell.  But under no circumstances will I take hG H in place of the scientifically designed and 
precision nutrition, high-performance exerci se physiology, stress reduction, appropriate 
amounts of well-designed nutritional supplements , and the other methods in this manual. 
 
The bottom line on hGH 
Here's the bottom: If you are doing all the othe r things in this system (many of which 
cost no money, save you money, and help you ma ke more money) and do have a lot of 
extra money ($800 to $1,200 per month), then co nsider it --  but only under the guidance of 
a qualified neuroendocrinologist. But not absolutely according to the pharmaceutical 
Doing 120 mph in the driveway  
160 industry in their official policy.  As a matter of fact, they s tipulate that the physician must 
be a pediatric endocrinologist. 
  On the margin, it would probably be wort h it for you.  But you are likely to get much 
less value from growth hormone alone than the effective, conventional, common sense 
approaches like practicing excellent scientif ically designed nutriti on and exercise, stress 
reduction, proven nutritional supplements and other methods described in this manual.  
 
Counterfeit Anti-Aging Drugs and Pharmaceuticals 
Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a major worl dwide problem.  Regarding imported 
pharmaceuticals, you just don't know what you're  getting. There have been reports of 
counterfeit drugs, with packag ing that appears to be genui ne, being manufactured in the 
U.S. then smuggled into foreign countries.  Many drugs manufactured in other countries do 
not meet the same quality control standards as in the U.S.  It is against the law to get drugs 
without a prescription, and it is suicidal to take drugs wit hout expert medical guidance. 
 
Nutrutional Supplement Guidelines 
Nutritional supplements should meet FDA st andards and be manufactured according to 
FDA protocol for laboratories licensed under st rict federal guidelin es for pharmaceutical 
grade products. They should be hypoallergenic, and not contain a ny salt, sugar, or artificial 
dyes, colors or flavors.  They should be as fres h as possible.  
Some companies manufacture vitamins as cheapl y  as possible, and in huge batches in 
order to reduce the cost, so their products of ten sit on the shelves for a long period of time 
(for months or years).  Most multivitamin/mineral formulas sold in stores are over two years old by the time they are bought off the shel f from the time of manufacture. Also these 
ingredients are usually a mixture of  "natural" and processed products.  
Recently scientists have found that syntheti c compounds are purer and more completely 
absorbed by the body than the so called "nat ural" products. For example "Natural" Vitamin 
E Oil capsules are rancid because they cannot be protected from oxidation in the oil form. 
Vitamin E does not become an antioxidant until it crosses the intestinal membrane and becomes chemically changed from the Ester fo rm through hydrolysis to the free form. The 
only safe way to take Vitamin E is the synthe tic form which is a pur e crystalline powder. 
The most important concept to appreciate  when undergoing therapy for almost any 
condition is that people are diffe rent. It is easy to see the su perficial aspects of body shapes, 
hair, skin color, etc., but ther e are far more numerous and clin ically important factors that 
lie beneath the skin. Some of these are physiological (i.e., ho w much of how may 
antioxidants we have consumed, our vitamin/mi neral reserves, our i mmune system activity, 
our hormone levels, our toxic bu rdens, etc.). These latter elements are generally termed 
"biochemical individuality." 
 
What Makes a Good Multivitamin, Wh o Needs One and What They Do 
In a perfect world, patients would get an ad equate amount of essential nutrients from a 
well-balanced diet. However, for a variety of reasons-including nutritional deficiency, 
pregnancy, advanced years, and lifestyle-ma ny patients simply are unable to meet these 
recommended standards and may re quire dietary supplementation. 
For example, research has shown that adequate  levels of folate can  prevent neural tube 
disorders in the developing fetus. Howe ver, demonstrating that multivitamin 
161 supplementation prevents chronic disease ha s been another matter-made difficult by many 
contributing cofactors, such as diet, fa mily history, and environmental issues. 
Clinical trials and observational studies suggest an association between multivitamin 
use and disease prevention, but no clear causal relationship ha s been shown. For example, 
among the nearly 90,000 participan ts in the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study, the women who 
took multivitamins for 15 years reduced their risk of colon cancer by as much as 75%1. The data also suggest that multivitamins may reduce the risk of breas t cancer in certain 
women. Conversely, results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
found cancer mortality and overall mortality we re similar in regular  users and nonusers of 
dietary supplements. 
According to a survey conducted by the Amer ican Dietetic Associ ation (ADA), nearly 
half of Americans consume vitamin and mineral supplements on a daily basis 
A well-balanced diet can provide  adequate levels of most vi tamins and minerals as well 
as fiber and phytochemicals. Often, people w ho eat a nutritious di et don’t need to 
supplement with a multivitamin. Ironically, many studies have shown that people who have higher intakes of nutrients from food are th e very people who are most likely to take a 
multivitamin. 
As reflected in the ADA study, regular vita min and mineral supplementation increases 
with age and is associated with more frequent intake of fruit and vegetables.  Multivitamin 
use also seems to be most prevalent among thos e who believe their health is affected by 
diet. 
Try as many patients might, however, only 28% of Americans have made significant 
adjustments in their eating behavior. The vast  majority have failed to achieve a healthy, 
nutritious diet or have made no effort at al l. In addition, many people have special dietary 
concerns and may not be able to  get adequate levels of nutri ents from the food they eat. 
These people may include the elderly, children, pregnant women, the physically active, and 
those with absorption problems or chronic illnesses. In these situations, dietary 
supplementation may be necessary. 
 
Antioxidants 
Antioxidants are among the most important nutritional supplements.  They provide 
protection against free radical damage.  Now might be a good time to refresh your memory 
with a review of the section on free radicals  in Chapter 1 where we saw why free radicals 
are so damaging to your health.  
Antioxidants also may inhibit the forma tion of fatty streaks and plaque that 
progressively close off arteries.  LDL choles terol (the "bad" choles terol) have to be 
oxidized by free radicals in order to form thes e plaques. White blood cells' chief function is 
to scavenge toxins and other matter for excreti on.  As a result of engorging fat droplets of 
cholesterol-filled LDLs, the white blood cells  become transformed and become embedded 
in arterial walls within plaque.  Free radicals  attack LDL particles, deplete them of their 
antioxidants and degrade the pol yunsaturated fatty acids (lin oleic acid and arachadonic 
acid) that are bound to phospholip ids in their outer layer. 
Some of the body's own free radical scav enging enzymes are called superoxide 
dismutase, glutathione peroxida se and catalase.  For most pe ople, antioxidants are the most 
important component of their  supplement program. Vitamins C, E, B1, B5, B6, zinc, 
selenium, cysteine, and methionine are among th e most important  and most effective.  
Prescription antioxidants, like Hydergine, bromocriptine, and DMAE may also be 
162 considered, but only under close medical  supervision by a doc tor who is highly 
experienced in their use. 
In appropriate amounts, antioxidants can be particularly useful in the prevention of 
senile dementia.  
Aspirin 
An 80 mg "baby" aspirin each night can reduce platelet clumping, thereby helping 
prevent artery blockage and h eart attack..  A platelet is a disc shaped cell in the blood 
responsible for coagulation.  However, this can re sult in a slightly increa sed risk of stroke.  
Also, aspirin is an acid and can irritate the stomach. 
Also, a full sized aspirin tablet  and 1-2 cups of coffee on an empty stomach is the most 
effective and safest way to increase thermogenisis for enhanced fat loss. 
 
Timing 
Most antioxidant supplements are water sol uble and only stay in your system for a few 
hours. Antioxidant molecules are used up one-fo r-one with free radicals,  so it is essential 
that they be taken in divide d doses throughout the day.   So antioxidants should be taken at 
lease twice a day -- ideally every 3-4 hours.  Also, exercise gene rates free radicals, so take 
antioxidants within a couple of hours before exercise.  
Stay away from all herbal stimulants be fore your workout -- and anytime -- as 
they could be very dangerous.  These include St. Johns Wort, yohimbe, ma huang, 
ephedrine, ephedra among others. They ca n cause dangerously high blood pressure 
and irregular heart rhythms, and result in death.  
 
Making vitamins easier to swallow 
Chewing just a little banana, then popping th e pills in the mouth along with the banana, 
then swallowing them together can make your vitamins easier to swallow.  But be aware 
that some vitamins should be taken on an empty stomach.  Discuss this with your doctor. 
 
A Basic Vitamin, Nutrient, Mineral System 
Here's the generic nutritional supplement ation program developed by Dr. Lee-Benner 
to meet the basic nutritional supplementation needs of most people who are following the 
other components of this system.    
 
Medical Details -- and Follow Your Doctor's Guidance  
Review the "friendly" disclaimer at the start of this manual.  
It is recommended that you consult a phy sician who is highly experienced in 
health, fitness & aging intervention for a personal program based on your own 
personal characteristics. Have a complete physical exam (w hich is probably long overdue 
anyway) and get your doctors approval before  implementing any of the ideas in this 
manual.  This information is not intended to di agnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, 
and is not intended to provide medical advi ce or be a substitute  for a physician. For 
medical advice, consult a properly trained physician.  
The supplements recommended in the for im proved brain and nervous system Tier 1 
basic system in this manual are proven to be effective by scientific research.  Small doses 
163 are recommended.  A vast majority of people taking them feel more alert, happier and 
experience greater mental clarity.  Still, everyone  is different.  So if  you begin to feel not 
right, for example like being unusually agitat ed or "revved up", or overthinking an 
unfavorable situation that may arise, or subdue d, or notice anything nega tive that is unusual 
about the way you feel, discontinue them for a day or so, then try smaller amounts of them 
one-at-a-time to fine tune your system to find out what works best for you. 
As an example, choline is a dietary precurs or to acetylcholine in the central nervous 
system. It has improved memory and learning in normal subjects and is considered an 
essential component of a suppl ement program.  If you become depressed, choline is the 
most likely candidate to reduce. 
So discuss it with your physician, and pay at tention to how you feel and be aware that 
you may have to fine-tune your system as l ong as you are on an antiaging system and as 
long as you are taking supplements.  
These formulas are designed to be synergistic  with each other.  These are combined in 
precise ratios to each other in order to work properly. They are designed to build your immunity to disease, counteract  the effect of a nutrient de pleted processed food diet, and 
revitalize your overall health. 
 
And Once Again, If You Have a Medical Condition 
As with nutrition and exercise, if you h ave a medical condition, that changes 
things.  Your supplement requirements may be different from someone without your 
condition, dosages may be different  and lab tests may be needed.  
If you are taking prescription medica tions, care should be taken to avoid 
interactions.  This requires expert medical advice. 
Everyone is different, and the same p erson may have different requirements 
depending on their age, physiology, genes, what 's going on in their life, how long they 
have been practicing this system, and numerous other variables.  Also, recommended vitamins, nutrients and minerals will be di fferent depending on your life’s conditions 
at any one time.  These could include time s of stress, whether you smoke or drink, 
whether you have high cholesterol, etc.  P ay attention to how you feel and discuss it 
with your doctor, and be aware that you may have to fine-tune your system as long as 
you are on  an antiaging system and as long as you are taking supplements. 
Actually, how you "feel" may be very misleadin g.  You don't have to feel "bad" to have 
something bad going on.  Also, risk factors are important things to be identified and 
amelorated. 
An excellent resource that offers specif ics on medical condition precautions,  drug 
interactions and recommendations for special ci rcumstances is “Physicians Guide to Free 
Radicals, Immunity and Aging”  by Lord Lee-Benner, M.D. 
Scientific units such as "I .U.", "mg" and "mcg" are different ways of measuring the 
amounts of vitamins and minerals in each tablet  or soft gel. Water-soluble vitamins and 
supplements, such as B vitamins and vitamin C, are measured in milligrams (mg) and micrograms (mcg); one milligram (1/1000 of a gram) is equal to 1000 micrograms. Minerals that are needed in smaller amounts in the body are also measured in micrograms.  
 
"I.U.", or "International Unit," is the global standard for m easuring fat-soluble vitamins 
and minerals (e.g. vitamins A, D and E).  The I U is similar to the United States 
Pharmacopeia unit (USP) that al so is based on measured biolog ical activities.  The use of 
164 IU is mostly having to do with the daily re quirements for a human or an animal with the 
purpose of providing adequate an amount.   System atic procedures are used to determine its 
function, the effects of deprivation, and quantit ative requirement.  So the results will be 
expressed in terms of I U. 
 
The following supplement formulations (Basic antioxidant and vitamin formulation, 
Brain/Mind Formula I, Brain/Mi nd Formula II, and Growth Hormone Releasing Nutrients ) 
were designed by Dr. Lee-Benner 
 
Basic antioxidant and vitamin formulation 
Directions:  Please be sure you have read the secti on on free radicals in Chapter 2 -- 
Practical Information.   
An antioxidant nutrient is a compound presen t naturally in the diet, or added to it, 
which lowers the rate of production of delete rious changes by free radi cal reactions without 
significantly impairing the essential reactions  involved in body main tenance and function. 
The beneficial effects of antioxidant nut rients are now supported by many studies, 
including those that have increased life span and lowered disease incidence. In fact experts 
in caloric restricted diets for optimum health  and Longevity agree th at in addition to a 
sustained low-caloric intake, we need the equi valent of a 20,000 calorie  diet in nutritional 
supplements each day to protect us from free radical damage! 
The formula below contains the appropriate ba lance of necessary antioxidants: vitamins 
A,B,C,E, and D, plus minerals, selenium and zi nc designed to shield and protect cells from 
harmful oxidants and help ensure normal ce ll life. It provides calcium, magnesium and 
potassium in the right amounts for good health, nu trients which also help to protect bones, 
nerves, muscles and teeth against some of the effects of aging.  This formulation is high in 
both Vitamin C and E antioxidant s, which have been shown to  help reduce the risk of 
developing Alzheimer’s disease. 
Take two to three tablets with  the following ingredients with a full 8oz glass of water 
two to three times a day after meals as a diet ary supplement or as di rected by your doctor.

Brain Formulations -- Nutritional supplements often effect different parts of the body.  
The following act on the brain and nerv ous system for the most part.     
The supplements recommended in the for im proved brain and nervous system Tier 1 
basic system in this manual are proven to be effective by scientific research.  Small doses 
are recommended.  A vast majority of people taking them feel more alert, happier and 
experience greater mental clarity.  Still, everyone  is different.  So if  you begin to feel not 
right, for example like being unusually agitat ed or "revved up", or overthinking an 
unfavorable situation that may arise, or subdue d, or notice anything nega tive that is unusual 
about the way you feel, discontinue them for a day or so, then try smaller amounts of them 
one-at-a-time to fine tune your system to find out what works best for you. 
As an example, choline is a dietary precurs or to acetylcholine in the central nervous 
system. It has improved memory and learning in normal subjects and is considered an 
essential component of a suppl ement program.  If you become depressed, choline is the 
most likely candidate to reduce. 
So discuss it with your physician, and pay at tention to how you feel and be aware that 
you may have to fine-tune your system as l ong as you are on an antiaging system and as 
long as you are taking supplements.

167 Growth Hormone Releasing Nutrients 
3 to 6 at bedtime or upon awakening 
This formulation is a must for those who want to stimulate human growth hormone 
(hGH) production, immune and mental function, as well as lower blood pressure, reverse 
heart disease, have a better body, lose wei ght or increase fertility, and enhance sexual 
function. 
Some amino acids, like L-Ornithine, L- Tyrosine, L-Arginine , L-Carnitine and 
Phenylalylene can stimulate growth hormone s ecretion. Cofactors, like Vitamins C and B6 
are needed to help them work. They should be taken on an empty stomach when going to bed and when first awakening. 
Arginine, a by-product of Ornithin e, is now recognized to be a  pro sexual nutrient 
(whoopee!!). Arginine increases sperm count a nd motility. An Italian research team found 
sperm count to increase over 100% following ar ginine supplementation for six months. 
Fertility was increased over two-fold. Arginine works for both men and women by 
enhancing nitric oxide (NO) levels. NO has been dubbed the "sex trigger" because it has 
been found to be the neuromediator responsible  for initiating erections  in men, and vaginal 
arousal in women. In one dramatic study, 6 of  15 impotent men noted restoration of normal 
sexual function after only 2 weeks of taking 2.8 grams of arginine per day. 
At the 1995 meeting of the American Heart Association, British researchers reported 
that the amino acid arginine may reverse so me components of the aging process. Their 
findings were that the linings  of blood vessels, known as endothelium, are damaged by age-
related loss of their pow er to respond to triggering mech anisms that signal blood vessels 
expansion or contraction. This leads to heart disease. This study showed that his damage 
can be provented, or reversed by arginine. 
Free-form amino acids such as tyrosine, orni thine, arginine, glutamine, phenylalanine, 
L-Dopa, tryptophan and carnitine have been prov en in clinical tests by endocrinologists to 
provide a host of youth restoring properties to our brains. They enhance neuromuscular 
transmission, thus enabling our bodies to ma intain youthful function such as mental 
alertness, strength, vigor and stamina. They enhance sexual function, not only arousal and 
erectile function, but also sensation and fertility.  
By stimulating growth hormone release, it increases lean body mass, decreases body 
fat, and blood lipids, improves cardiac a nd immune function and also increases bone 
density along with skin thic kness, hair and nail growth.  
There is reason to believe the combination of Tyrosine, L-Ornithine, L-Arginine, and 
L-Carnitine, along with vita min co-factors B6 and C, are synergistic. The Lee-Benner 
Institute has followed the beneficial changes in  hundreds of age-related patients using this 
formula over the past 15 years. There have been excellent health improvements. These 
results were over and above the benefits achieved through just diet, exercise and 
maintaining a healthy lifestyle alone. 
This formula can stimulate hGH production, and lower blood pressure, reverse heart 
disease, have a better body, lose weight or increase fertility, and enhance sexual function. 
If you have cold sores, canker sores or herpes, this formulation may worsen the 
situation so consider de creasing or eliminating. 
 
168 Directions:  Take three to six tablets with a full 8o z glass of water, on an empty stomach at 
bed time (at least 3 hours after eating), and/or half hour befo re breakfast as a dietary 
supplement. One capsule contains:

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) 60.0 mg 100 
* US RDA has not yet been established 
 
Acetyl L-Carnitine 
Acetyl L-Carnitine is recommended, particul arly before exercise, because it enhances 
energy metabolism at a cellular level by easing tr ansport of fatty acids, which are used for 
energy, across the cellular membra ne.  This also helps prot ect the mitochondria -- the 
damage of mitochondria is one cause and type of aging.  
Essential Oils  
The most important ingredient in this supplement formulation are phospholipids and 
essential oils (fatty acids).  "Essential" means that the body cannot manufacture them, so 
they must come from the diet.  Thes e are phosphatydylserine, phosphatydylcholine, 
phosphatydylethanolamine and phosphatydylinosito l in a base containing medium chain 
triglycerides (MCTs).  These supplement helps build cell membranes, as well as keep nerve 
cell membranes flexible, permeable and resistant to stress and damage.   
Phosphatidylserine has been demonstrated in double-blind placebo-co ntrolled scientific 
studies to play an important and unique role  in memory function. MCT stands for medium-
chain triglycerides, a description of the lengt h of carbon chain of the fatty acids that make 
up the oil. MCT improves fat digestion and absorption. 
Only one-half tablespoon, twice a day, is recommended.  
Saw Palmetto (for men) 
     Saw palmetto can help to keep the prosta te gland from age-related enlargement.  (There 
is some positive evidence for its effectiveness against prostate problems, but there's a lack of real scientific information based on well-designed clinical trials.)  
Description of Supplements 
Vitamin or Nutrient, and Function -- Part ial list of known func tions for many of 
these. 
 
Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid, Ascorbate) The body's first line of internal defense.  Controls free radicals.  Can prevent the formation 
of peroxides or nitrosamines.  Essential in th e repair of skin, bones, teeth, and the ground 
169 substance between cells.  Detoxifies carci nogens, pollutants and pesticides.  Improves 
responses to stress.  Essential for brain neur otransmitter metabolism.  Membrane stabilizer, 
blocks malignant transformations, can increas e lymphocyte responsiveness.  May protect 
against cardiovascular disease by lowering total blood cholestero l and raising HDL-
cholesterol.  Vitamin E Antioxidant - free radical scavenger.  Preven ts lipid peroxidation of  PUFAs in the cell, 
particularly in the cell membrane.  Prot ects red blood cells from oxidative hemolysis 
(destruction of red blood cells and escape of  the hemoglobin within the bloodstream). 
Inhibits prostaglandin  (a  kind of fatty acid).   
 Vitamin A Immune system stimulant, affects thymus gl and to improve T-cell response.  Inhibits 
arthritis and the promotion pha se of carcinogenesis (cancer). 
 Viramin B1 (Thiamine HCl) Immune system stimulant and antioxidant.  Required for lipid synthesis from carbohydrates 
and conversion of glycogen (sugar as  it is stored in the liver and held ready for release) into 
ATP.   Plays role in peripheral nerve conduction.  Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) Riboflavin is essential for regulating oxidation and reductio n reactions and for reducing 
glutathione to prevent lysis of RBCs, reduc ing allergic reactions, and inhibiting the 
formation of cataracts. It may inhibit tumor development. Caution: Must be taken with other antioxidants to prevent photosentization. Large doses 
are contraindicated during lactation. 
 Riboflavin 5-Phosphate This is the same as B2, and it makes the ur ine bright yellow. So when it becomes straw-
colored again, it means all the water soluble vitamins have been eliminated from your 
system and it is time to replenish them for optimum protection.  Vitamin B3 (Niacin) Too much niacin can result in an uncomfortable  "flush", or kind of reddening accompanied 
by a warm sensation and possibly disorientati on.  Niacin is essentia l in the production of 
energy from carbohydrates. Large doses reduce se rum cholesterol, triglycerides and VLDL 
levels. Niacin elevates and stabilizes blood s ugar levels, stimulates histamine release for 
improved sexual function, and has been found to cause tranquilization.  High-dose niacin 
improves long-term mortality rate s in post-myocardical patients. 
Caution: Large doses may not be beneficial fo r maximum output endurance. Large doses 
may increase utilization of muscle  glycogen stores and decrease mobilization of fatty acids.  
To be used with caution for patients with se nsitivity to serotonin (headaches may develop), 
asthma or peptic ulcer disease. Watch for elev ated levels of serum en zymes, uric acid or 
glucose, liver damage and HBP. May cause temporary drowsiness which is dose related 
and subsides with tolerance. Large doses of  niacin are contraindicated during lactation. 
Niacinamide This is similar to niacin, but it doesn't produce the flush that you get fr om niacin.  It doesn't 
give you the benefit of reducing your car diovascular risk factors, either. 
 Vitamin B5 Pantothenic Acid  (D-Calcium Pantothenate) 
170 Pantothenic acid is a strong antioxidant and anti-stress vitamin. Pantothenate greatly 
increases resistance to stress in experimental  animals and humans.  In mouse studies, it 
increased life span by 20% when fed in quant ities of 12 mg/kg (equal to one gram/day for 
an adult human). Vitamin B5 makes up one-half of acetyl-CoA which is needed to convert 
choline to acetylcholine, is essential fo r the conversion ofglycogen to ATP and the 
biosynthesis of fatty acids. It prevents autooxi dation of L-Dopa in the brain and may help 
prevent autoimmune reactions. Caution: Large doses may cause a laxative effect. To prevent this, start with low doses 
(lOOmg/day).  Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxin HCl) High protein diets increase the requirements for pyridoxine in order to reduce free-radical 
damage. B6 supplements are also advised fo r  patients on INH therapy for TB prevention, 
penicillamine for treatment of Wilson's Diseas e, corticosteroid therapy, anti-convulsants 
and chronic alcohol abuse syndr ome. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome have become 
asymptomatic after a number  of weeks on l000mg/day. Long term treatment with large 
doses (500 mg/day or more) have resulted in ma rked clinical improvement in diabetics. It 
is necessary for fatty acid metabolism and should improve stamina for high performance 
endurance athletes. There are many references  citing its role in CNS metabolism,  
immunological phenomena, the prevention of kidney  stones, atherosclerosis, dental caries 
and endocrine metabolism. It plays an important role in the health of  the elderly. There are 
special requirements during pregnancy and during the taking of oral contraceptives. 
Caution: Parkinson patients initiating L-dopa ther apy should be closely supervised. Large 
doses, greater than 200mg/day are  contrai ndicated during lactation. Larger doses may 
cause reversible peripheral neuropathies.  
Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate 
An important co-factor needed for basic ce llular metabolism and the creation of energy 
within the cell.  It is involved in the synthesis and catabolism of all amino acids. 
  Vitamin B12 (as Cyanocobalamin) Cyancobalamin (vitamin 812) is recommended in normal adults from an anti-aging perspective because of research  that shows that it increase s RNA synthesis in rat brain 
neurons and is associated with improved learni ng in rat experiments. It is recommended, 
along with other agents, to counter the damaging effects of alcohol to memory. 
Caution: Even additional B12 may not protect ag ainst Bi2 deficiency when one takes 
megadoses of Vitamin C.  Beta Carotine B-carotene is converted to vitamin A on de mand in the body. High doses are non-toxic but 
can turn the skin yellow-orange (which is re versible). B-carotene is a highly effective 
quencher of singlet oxygen. It also protects against ultravio let radiation, and is being 
studied as a possible prev ention against lung cancer. 
 Vitamin D3 (Fish Liver Oil) Principal regulator fo rcalci um homeostasis, bone metabolis m and skeletal development. 
 Folic Acid An important cofactor for many intracellular energy reactions.  An essential ingredient for 
red blood cells, and the nervous system.  Lowe rs the risk of neural tube defects and 
171 possibly othe r types of birth defects.  It may have anti atherogenic, anticarcinogenic, 
neuroprotective, and antidepressant actions.  Biotin Biotin is a sulfur-containing antioxidant vi tamin and a portion of acetyl- CoA. It is 
important in fatty acid biosynthesis. Biotin se ems to be a growth factor. It improves energy, 
stamina and may benefit hi gh output endurance Athletes. 
 Inositol Inositol is an antioxidant and membrane- stab ilizing B vitamin. It promotes calming and 
REM sleep when used with niacin and GAB A. This combination is recommended as a 
substitute for alcohol or tranquilizers for suffere rs of anxiety or chr onic stress syndrome. It 
may have a function in reducing the pain of  arthritis. Another dietary component, phytic 
acid (inositol hexaphosphate) from cereals might  be the most important variable governing 
the frequency of colon cancer. Caution: When calcium intake or vitamin D activ ation by the sun is low, high inositol 
intake could be a contributi ng factor to osteoporosis. 
 PABA (Para Aminobenzoic Acid) Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is an an tioxidant, membrane-stabilizing B-complex 
vitamin. It has been used to retard ha ir loss and premature graying.  PABA is 
recommended for extra antioxidant protecti on from ozone, nitrogen oxides, and carbon 
monoxide gases. It can provide  added protection (when used  with other antioxidants) 
against lipid peroxidatio n. It is also benefici al to people who suffer from obesity, chronic 
respiratory conditions, arthritis , injuries and bruises.  
Caution: PABA is acidic and high doses (especially  when combined with vitamin C or 
niacin) may lead to gastric upset or  potentate peptic ulcer disease. 
Warning: PABA completely neutralizes the effect of sulfonamides. 
 Lemon Bioflavenoids Hesperidin and rutin are cof actors found in vitamin C and in crease the bioavailability of 
vitamin C and enhance its immune stimulant e ffect. Rutin is effective in preventing free-
radical-induced cataract forma tion in experimental animals.  Bioflavinoids are membrane 
stabilizers known to increase capillary resist ance and prevent damage to joint membranes 
and intimal lining of arteries. Supplements in doses of 500 mg to 1 gm have antithrombogenic, antiatheroge nic and antiarthritic effect s and enhance the immune 
stimulant effect of vitamin C.  L-Glutathione (99% reduced) This is the primary ingredient amont the thr ee amino acids which form the building blocks 
for one of the most important antioxidant enzy mes (glutathione peroxidase) to protect red 
blood cells from oxidation. Iodine (Marine Organ Min. Complex) Used to make thyroid hormone.  Calcium (Hydroxyapatite, Ascorbate) Basic building block for bone formation.  Magnesium (Amino Acid Chelate Citrate, Aspartate) Essential mineral -- the most abundant in th e body for many cellular reactions, control of 
blood pressure, nerve transmi ssion, muscle contraction. 
172  
Zinc (Picolinate) Zinc is essential for the f unction of more than 70 enzymes and is involved in many 
biochemical processes.  It is a free-radical quencher, membrane   stabilizer, and is required 
for mobilization of vitamin A stores from the liver It reduces the requirement for vitamin E in the RBC membrane to protect it from oxida tive damage.  It prevents the formation of 
MDA  another indicator of lipid  peroxidation. It directly s timulates the immune system 
resulting in a ten-fold increase in B cell perf ormance and three to five-fold  increase in T 
cell activity.  Zinc may be an  alternative to penicillamine  therapy for the treatment of 
Wilson's disease. The best reason for the use  of zinc as a prophylactic is its role in 
enhancing SOD, which is protec tive against air pollution, arthriti s, immune system decline, 
cross linking of skin  and other structural  organs, early mental and sensory decline 
associated with premature aging, as well as fo r its sparing of vitamin E and  enhancement 
of vitamin A function. Caution: Doses of 300 mg/day may actually result  in decreased immune activity, and  
doses of 100 mg/day have been associated wi th a reversible fall in serum  HDL levels 
during supplementation.  Potassium (Citrate) Essential component of the body's electrolyte system needed for all cellular functions. 
 Manganese (Aspartate) Makes up an energy component for the in tracellular factories,  the mitochondria. 
Chromium (Aspartate) Chromium in yeast enhances glucose utiliza tion through maintaining the body's sensitivity 
to insulin.  Glucose tolerance in chromium-def icient Turkish children was rapidly corrected 
when chromium was supplemented. Supplementation with chromium salts or with 
chromium-rich brewers yeast Enhances gl ucose tolerance in prediabetic adults. 
 Selenium (Amino Acid Chelate) Selenium is a free-radical quencher, primary an tioxidant and immune system stimulant. It 
combines with L-cysteine to form an important  part of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. 
It enhances vitamin E activity. It is important in slowing unc ontrolled cross-linking of skin 
and elastic tissue. It interferes with pol ynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) activation 
and binding to DNA. Selenium  when combined  with BHT, zinc and other antioxidant 
nutrientsbenefits smoker's cough, arthritic a ttacks, age pigment removal, damage to 
hormonal responsive areas of the sexual apparatu s, and risks of cancer  and atherosclerosis 
from acetaldehyde due to smoking and alcohol consumption. Warning: Excessive doses (greater than 600 mc g/day) of selenium may be toxic 
 Copper (Amino Acid Chelate) Only small amounts required for structural co mponent in certain intracellular signaling 
mechanisms. Caution: Too much cause s oxidation and free radical damage. 
 Molybdenum (Amino Acid Chelate) Only small amounts required for structural co mponent in certain intracellular signaling 
mechanisms. Caution: Too much cause s oxidation and free radical damage. 
 Vanadium (Amino Acid Chelate) Has insulin like effects, to enhance muscle  uptake of glucose and energy metabolism.

Organic excipient used in tablet construction.   
Brain/Mind Formulations  
Choline Bitartrate 
Choline is a dietary precursor to acetylcholin e in the CNS. It has improved memory and 
learning in normal subjects. It also aids in the lubrication of membranes for sexual 
function. Choline has relatively few side effects.    Co mplaints related to high doses include diarrhea, 
abdominal cramps, and nausea.  Bacteria in the intestine can change choline into an 
unpleasant, fishy smelling substance. Rarely, depressive people may become more depressed, or withdrawn or ap athetic, even on small doses. 
If you become depressed, or feel agitated or "revved up", reduce it and see how you feel. 
Caution: Should not be use in the pres ence of affective disorders. Bacteria in the intestine 
can change choline into an unpleasant, fis hy smelling substance. High doses may cause 
diarrhea.  Vitamin B-5 (d calcium pantothenate) Vitamin B-5 is involved in a number of biol ogical reactions, includi ng the synthesis of 
acetylcholine, and in the production of energy, the catabolism of fatty acids and amino acids, the synthesis of fatty acids, phospholipids, sphingolip ids, cholesterol and steroid 
hormones. Caution: it is contraindicated  in those hypersensitive to a ny component.  Pregnant women 
and nursing mothers should avoid doses greate r that U.S. RDA (10 milligrams/day) unless 
higher dosage is prescribed by their physic ian. Those who have developed contact 
dermatitis from the use of dexpantherol may develop eczema from the use of oral 
pantothenic acid.  The use of pa ntothenic acid for any medical  condition must be medically 
supervised. DMAE bitartrate  Lecithin -Phosphatidyl choline Lecithin is a precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, is a major 
component of cell membranes and plays a ro le in the maintenance of cell-membrane 
integrity.  It is essential for liver function a nd can help restore liver function in a number of 
disorders.   Caution: Those with malabsorption problems ma y develop diarrhea or steatorrhea. 
 Pregnenolone Pregnenolone is a steroid naturally found in tissues, especially th e gonads, adrenal gland 
and brain.  It is reported to have memory-enhancing activity.   
Caution: Pregnenolone is contra indicated in those with prosta te, uterine and breast cancer.  
It should be avoided by children, nursing moth ers and pregnant women, and by those with 
seizure disorders.  Some people experience mild gastrointestinal effects like nausea.  
Pregnenolone may be converted to steroids such as DHEA, and DHEA can cause adverse 
effects like acne and hair lo ss (especially in women).   
 Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Ginkgo is used for memory and increased circul ation in the brain, and for the inhibition in 
age-related reduction of muscarin ergic cholinoceptors, as well  as stimulation of choline 
uptake in the hippocampus.  It has been de monstrated to improve concentration and 
174 memory deficits as a result of  peripheral arterial occlusiv e disease.  Other clinical 
applications include inhibition of toxically or traumatically induced cerebral edema and 
retinal edema. Caution: Ginkgo biloba has a strong inhibitory effect  on platelet-activa ting factor and has 
the potential to interact with an tithrombotic therapy.  It is co ntraindicated in patients known 
to be hypersensitive to Gingko biloba prepara tions.  Mild gastrointestinal complaints 
sometimes occur, and allergic skin reactions have been observed on extremely rare occasions.  Possibly hypersensitivity reactions  are spasms and cramps, and in cases of 
acute toxicity, loss of mu scle tone and weakness. 
 Inositol Inositol is necessary for the formation of lecithin w ithin the body and aids in the 
breakdown of fats and is often used to reduce cholesterol. 
Caution: Should be avoided by pregnant wome n and nursing mothers due to lack of long 
term safety studies.  Pyroglutamate Cognitive enhancer.  Use under physician's guidance.  
Growth Hormone Releasing 
L-Ornithine HCl 
L-Ornithine facilitates release of growth hor mone and directly stimulates T cells and 
thymus gland immune function.  Caution: GH releasers counter act the effect of insulin; sy mptoms of schizophrenia and 
herpes simplex can be increased. Not Reco mmended for diabetics, growing children, 
pregnant or lactating mothers. Should be a voided with MAO inhib itors or melanomas. 
 
L-Tyrosine L-Tyrosine acts as a growth hormone releas er through production of norepinephrine and L-
dopa.  It has antidepressant, stimul atory and anorexigenic effects.  
Important Note: Most effective when used with vitamins C and B6. Caution: Should not be taken concomitantly with MAO inhibitors.  Avoid with Patients 
with melanomas, high or low blood pressure.   L-Arginine Facilitates release of growth hormone.  L-Carnitine Facilitates release of growth hormone.  Vitamin B-6 (pyridoxine HCL) Cofactor, needed to help the above work.  Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) Cofactor, needed to help the above work.  
175 Chapter 9  -- A WHOLE LOT  MORE -- Sex, Doctors, Dental Care, 
Reducing Risks, Cosmetic Surgery and More 
My dear friends, Dave and Patty, are a Spen cer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn pair if I ever 
met one.  He's a retired Marine officer and aviator who has flown the unfriendly skies in 
combat missions in three wars, and comm anded thousands of men.  He's highly 
knowledgeable on a variety of subjects, and thoroughly likeable, a nd very republican.  
She's a writer, an entrepreneur, a forever charming peacenik, and a total democrat.    
Patty once offered me the quote "For longevity, make love your priority" .    
I suggested "Just leave off the 'your priority' part." 
 
Medical Details -- and Follow Your Doctor's Guidance  
Review the "friendly" disclaimer at the star t of this manual. Have a complete physical 
exam (which is probably long overdue anyw ay) and get your doctors approval before 
implementing any of the ideas in this manual. 
 
If You Have a Medical Condition 
As with nutrition, if you have a medical cond ition, that changes things. The information 
below would need to be modified  to meet your special needs. 
 
Joyful SEX 
So for longevity, make love with a willing (and 
hopefully wildly enthusiast ic) partner every day.  
OKOKOK, I'm just kidding about  the "wildly enthusiastic" 
part -- don't  hurt yourself.  
Lovemaking reduces physica l and emotional tension, 
and burns calories -- very good things. It doesn't have to go to the point of orgasm. It is estimated that you will expend about 240 calories having sex, so it even contributes to weight loss.  And it's believed  that an active sex life is 
beneficial due to endorphen production and release (although long term studies on that  point are lacking).   But 
I can personally verify  that it feels good. 
And of course, great sex satisfies deep emotional needs.  
A buildup of sexual energy that  is unrelieved can be 
stressful and cause depression or even impotence from constant self-repression. 
It's fun.  It's an anatomy lesson.  And, it is a spiritual 
connection with your significant other.   
Bedroom athletics may not be necessary to reap health benefits from sexual activity, 
University of Bristol in England researcher s suggest. And even non-vigorous sex may be 
enough to significantly reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.   
Although testosterone is not th e hormone of love, adequate amounts of testosterone are 
necessary for sexual desire and fulfillme nt in both men and women.  While most 
aphrodesiacs produce questionabl e results that are difficult to reproduce, for me avena 
sativa can really get your  motor running.  Most testosterone  is bound to albumin (a soluble 
 
Why so forlorn?   
Well… you’re supposed to 
have SEX  -- not SAX! 
176 protein carrier).  The avena sativa is thought  to unbind some of it, thereby temporarily 
making it available for use on re ceptor sites in the brain. 
And if you are a guy there's more good news fo r whoopee makin':  exercise results in -- 
get this -- an ongoing ability to get an erecti on throughout later years!  OK, so that's great 
news for a gal too!  Just as exercise causes  the growth of micro- capillaries throughout your 
body, it also causes the you to grow micro-capi llaries in your private parts, as well as 
keeping them free from the artery clogging blockage that  causes heart disease and 
impotence.  So none of those limp, embarrassing moments!    
Henry Feldman, an impotence expert at the New England Research Institute in 
Watertown, Mass., and a co-author of a recent study in the journal Urology , tells us that 
exercise is most likely an erection-friendly pastime because it boosts overall cardiovascular 
health     Hopefully it goes without saying, but  just in case you haven't heard: There are a 
lot of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases ) like HIV, etc. going around, and you don't want 
them. With the skill that HIV is able to muta te, I wouldn't be surprised if some time soon 
(if not now) it could be transmitted by kiss.  So reduce risk to zero by being in a 
monogamous relationship with someone who is  free of these kinds of complications.  
While there may be times that driving to your whoopee session would be more 
dangerous than the whoopee itself, practice sa fe sex and fasten your seat belt. While 
driving there, silly, not during the sex. And definitely no sex while driving. 
Also, you do know where babies come from, don't you? So unless you want to have a 
baby, practice birth control. 
Dr John Leiper, an expert in fluid balan ce and hydration at Aberdeen University, 
stresses the importance of drinking water afte r sex.  A survey carried out for the Highland 
Spring mineral water company showed that couples run out of steam after having sex 
because they fail to drink enough water.  Do ctors say the finding could explain why many 
people develop headaches or become lethargic after makin' whoopee.  They have warned 
that couples who work up a sweat in bed risk de hydration unless they repl enish their fluids.   
It is said that French couples, on the othe r hand, do not have such problems because they 
drink five times as much water (and have even  more sex) than their British counterparts.  
This particular study found that  just two out of five people drink water after sex, to be 
precise.  
And if you do not have a willing (and hopefully wildly enthusiastic) partner, well, then 
it's a daily menage-a-un for you (pardon my French).

Mad Dogs and Englishmen and Norwegian Blue Parrots Go Out in the Midday Sun 
Ionizing radiation (i.e. sunli ght) promotes the 2 stages of the carcinogenic process, 
initiation and promotion. It'll tan your hyde, Clyde.  This happens mostly because the rays damage your skins DNA, as well as protein and immune system cells.   
The irony is that a great looking tan can be the first sign of skin cancer. Most skin 
cancers will not kill you. But mali gnant melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer, which 
quickly spreads to the vital organs  of the body, and that will kill you. 
Even if you didn't do a lot of tanning earlier in your life, it would be a good idea to 
occasionally check for blemishes that are larger than a pencil eraser, multi-colored or a symmetrical in shape.  If you have any questions, see a dermatologist.  
Tanning also makes you look wrinkled and old because it damages protein fibers that 
hold the cells together. 
The American Academy of Dermatology sugge sts that, regardless of skin type, a 
sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) as high as possible (but at  least 15) should be 
used year-round, and applied every few hours while  exposed to the sun. The sun emits rays 
in different spectrums, called UvA and UvB.  The shorter wave UvB rays are responsible 
for burning.  But the longer wave UvA rays go de eper into the skin and are linked to aging, 
cancer and damage to the immune system so they are the greatest danger. The UvB rays 
make it to the earth's surface (and to you) only from around 11:00 am to 2:00 pm. 
However, there is some evidence that chemi cal sunscreens are toxic to the cells.  The 
ideal sunscreen is a " physical" sunscreen that blocks in the s un, such as titanium dioxide or 
zinc.   The problem is that these are white, and you can't get really high SPF. 
178 Tanning salons should be avoided. Tanning beds emit about 90% UvA -- about twice 
that received while sunbathing at  noon on the beach in the summer. 
The sun's rays will go right through glass, so they're even hitting you while you're 
driving.  This is one of the causes of cataracts in the eyes. It takes y ears to show up, that's  
why it is considered a disease of "old age".  Most sunscreens shield for UvB only.  You'll 
want a sunscreen that protects you from both Uv A and UvB.  Sunscreens with the chemical 
sounding "zinc oxide" or "titanium dioxide" are preferred. "Neutrogena Chemical Free 
Sunscreen", is one example. 
Also, it is recommended that ey ewear (both regular glasses an d sunglasses) be coated to 
screen for UV.  
 
Smoking (yuck) 
If you smoke, it's probably the single biggest hazard to your 
health, outweighing the others co mbined.  If you have tried to 
stop smoking and failed, just keep trying 
Smoking is known to directly stimulate LDL cholesterol 
oxidation through free radical production.  This is why, in addition to the lungs, the heart, the entire cardiovascular system, 
and immunity is particularly affected.   
Try smoking only one half of the cigarett e and throw the other half out (after 
extinguishing it, of course).  There is said to  be seven times as much yuck is in the second 
half as the first, and doing this really helped reduce th e addiction.  Hypnosis and the 
“patch” have worked for many people. The ki nd of affirmations f ound in the "Behavior 
Modification and Motivation" sec tion can be highly effective. 
If you still smoke, do what you need to do to in  order to quit as soon as possible. Until 
you finally do quit, additional antioxidant  supplementation would be appropriate, 
particularly vitamins C and E, beta carotine, B
1 and B 6, selenium.  A lot of people who 
would like to quit are worried about gaining we ight.  Well, following this system will help 
that.  And be assured, it would take trem endous amounts of overwe ight to cause the 
amounts of damage done by smoking.  So if you still smoke, find what works for you and 
just keep trying to quit.  Just keep trying 
 
Floss or Die 
Floss or Die: Implications  for Dental Professionals  was the ominous title of the lead 
story in the July 1998 issue of Dentistry Today .  Periodontal disease pa ired with a number 
of potentially life-threat ening disorders?  I'm afraid s o. There appears to be a causal 
relationship between certain plaq ue bacteria and aberrant bloo d platelet activity. There is 
also a great deal of circumstantial eviden ce linking untreated peri odontal disease with 
endocarditis (inflammation of the valves or  lining membrane of the heart) and lung 
infections in patients with ch ronic obstructive pulmonary dise ase. The plaque bacteria get 
into the bloodstream resulting in an increased risk for blood clots associated with 
myocardial infarction.  Th is spells heart attack. 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  is the sixth leading cause of death in 
the U.S. and nearly 16 million Americans suffer from the it.   A study published in Journal 
of Periodontology,  suggests that simply taking better care of their gums might help COPD 
patients to avert the progression of the disease. Oral biologi sts from the University of 
Buffalo studied the gums and lungs of 13,792 patients. Those patients with periodontal 

179 disease, they found, had a one-and-a-half times greater risk of COPD than did those with 
sound gums.  Lung problems worsened with decl ining oral health. "We know that the onset 
and progression of COPD is dependent on smoki ng, and that repeated bacterial infections 
can worsen the lung disease," says team member  Frank A. Scannapieco. "It is possible that 
periodontal bacteria could travel to the l ungs through saliva or nor mal breathing and in 
some way promote lung infection. Another possi bility is that the inflammation caused by 
periodontal disease may contribut e to inflammation of  the lining of the lung airway, which 
limits the amount of air that passes to and from  the lungs."  Not brushing one's teeth won't 
cause lung disease, but for those who already ha ve lung disease, it is especially important 
to take care of the teeth and gums. 
With a bit of DNA detective work on centuri es-old dental pulp, researchers have 
confirmed that the disease we know as the pl ague was responsible for epidemics centuries 
ago in southern France. The wor k, which appears in this week's  issue of the Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Sciences, is the ol dest confirmation of Yersinia pestis--the 
bacterium that causes the plague--with DNA- detection techniques. Until now, historians 
and scientists studying ancient plagues have re lied on symptoms recorded by contemporary 
observers.   Led by Michel Drancourt from the Un iversité de la Méditerranée in Marseille, 
the team settled on dental pulp--which is both dur able and likely to harbor infection--as the 
place to find intact DNA evidence. 
 
GREAT News! 
I just came from a dental checkup.  I had b een away and having an extremely busy 
working in the biotech industry in San Die go and had gone without a checkup for about a 
year (shame on me).  I was braced for the wo rst, but for the first time in a long time -- no 
caps, no crowns, no root canals, no t even a cavity!  This is a first, because each year for 
over 1-1/2 decades I have had at least  a crown -- sometimes tw o along with a couple of 
cavities and even a root canal.  This has cost  a lot of money, not to  mention the time. No, 
I'm not running out of teeth.  Decay and gum di sease can still occur in teeth and gums with 
crowns. 
To what do I owe this improvement?  I'm fi nally really taking care of the teeth and 
gums with the dental program described below.   But the single thing I have been doing 
during for the last year is daily flossing.  40%  of the tooth surface can only be reached with 
dental floss.  That means that if you're just brushing, you're only cleaning 60% of the 
surface of your teeth -- the remaining 40% is unprotected against decay!   
And it was Shannon, my dental hygienist, who gave me some great advice that, if 
you're not flossing daily (or like me, think of it as about as boring as a stop light) I'll now 
pass along to you: Put the floss right next to the toothbrush.  Think of the two of them 
as going together.  This will help you make daily flossing a habit.  Thanks Shannon! 
Tooth decay, or dental caries, is the disease that begins when bacteria produce an acid 
that diffuses into the teeth and deminerali zes them.  This acid is a byproduct of the 
fragmentation of carbohydrates -- especially sugars.  Dental caries (tooth decay) is 
preventable. 
Run your tongue over the surface of your teeth.  They should not feel velvety or fuzzy.  
"Disclosing tablets" made from vegetable dye will stain the plaque.  Look for colored areas 
near the gum line. 
You'll want a dental team that provides dent al education, as well as  high quality dental 
treatment.   My dentist, Dr. Nicholas Davi s in Newport Beach -- a nd his entire staff -- are 
truly excellent in this regard.  
180 Robin, who is also my dental hygienist (I'm lucky -- I get two dental hygienists) advises 
using light pressure with the toothbrush.  Light pressure assures that the tips will get right 
into the areas where needed.  Excessive pressu re can be destructive to the tooth, and can 
even brush away gum tissue and cause r ecession of the gum and expose the root. 
Dr. Davis recommends to start by brushing all the surfaces of the teeth, then wedge the 
tips of the bristles down under the gum at about a 45  angle and slowly rota te in circles (the 
brush, not you) and finally pull the debris up and out.  Like a hula -- it shouldn't be 
particularly fast or hard.  The tips of the br istles will splay, helping to remove plaque and 
debris.  Be sure to get the hard to reac h areas, like behind the wisdom teeth.  The 
toothbrush with a little extended tuft on the end can be good for this.  Dry brushing can be 
effective, especially in areas  that are concave, like behi nd and in front of the upper and 
lower front teeth.  Get a new toothbrus h every couple of months or so.   
My weapon of choice is the Oral-B "Advant age" (medium) toothbr ush.  Watch out for 
those toothbrush handles with the heavy-duty indu strial strength grips that make it too easy 
to brush the teeth with hard pressure. 
Brush at least twice a day, and preferably after every meal, and definitely before 
bedtime.  Use a rubber tip at the gum line and be tween the teeth (inner and outer side of the 
teeth).  Flossing should be  at least once a day, and preferably twice a day.  
It takes 24 hours for dental plaque to "organize"  -- or form a matrix.  We need to totally 
disorganize it from every tooth surf ace, at least once each 24 hours.  
I use Colgate PreviDent 5000 Gel (1.1% Sodium  Fluoride) which I get from my dentist 
(if you use PreviDent, follow the instructions  and your dentist’s inst ructions – it’s not a 
dentifrice).  I first brush us ing my electric toothbrush, then apply the PreviDent to the 
surface of teeth with  a regular toothbrush, then floss. 
Every second of the day your teeth lose minera ls -- particularly calcium.  Minerals in 
saliva re-mineralize teeth.  When you use fluor ide toothpaste it substitutes fluoride (a better 
mineral for your teeth) for calcium that has be en naturally lost.  This makes teeth harder 
and more resistant to decay, at any age.  As age increases, sometimes saliva flow decreases 
-- particularly if you are on medications.  That  is why sometimes wh en people start taking 
certain medications (for example, certain hi gh blood pressure or heart medications) they 
experience dry mouth syndrome and rapid decay.  Saliva substitutes can help with this -- along with drinking adequate water. Water r un through reverse osmosis pulls out minerals 
from your teeth. Don't swallow the fluoride. 
Or, brush with baking soda and water, or  with baking soda mixed with hydrogen 
peroxide to form a thick paste (baking soda is  probably the best dent al cleaner there is). 
There has been a lot of negative press about fl uoride, especially rega rding its edition to 
municipal water supplies. Some municipal water has lots of chlorine, which is not good.  
However, studies have shown that the lim ited amounts of fluoride in toothpaste or 
mouthwash is not a problem.  If you do not use a fluoride toothpaste, rinse with a fluoride 
mouth wash. Brush for at least 3-5 minutes.  Massage with a pointed tip at the gums 
between the teeth to break up the colonies of  bacteria. Don't eat or drink the fluoride 
toothpaste or mouth wash, and be sure that  children do not eat or  drink the fluoride 
toothpaste or mouth wash.  And some people,  especially children, who use too much 
fluoride developed a discoloring of th e teeth called dent al fluorosis.   
Unwaxed floss works best.  No rinse, as that would wash the fluoride away. The 
American Dental Association recommends this  method: Break off about 18 inches of floss 
and wind most of it around one of your middle fingers.  Wind the remaining floss around 
the same finger of the opposite hand.  Hold ing the floss between phones and for fingers, 
181 guide the floss between the teeth, using a ge ntle rubbing motion.  Avoid snapping the floss 
into the gums, which can cause bleeding.  With the floss reache s the gum line, curve it into 
a "C" shape around the sides of one tooth, gent ly sliding into the space between tooth and 
gum.  Holding the floss tightly against one toot h, rub the side of the tooth from gum line to 
top, using an up-and-down motion.  (Avoid si de-to-side, or sawing, motion; some people 
do this so vigorously they actually wear a groove  in the tooth over time).  People who have 
difficulty grasping a toothbrush, such as arth ritics, can push the ha ndle into a styrofoam 
ball to use as a more comfortable handle. 
A hand held toothbrush works great for mo st people, but sometimes an electric 
toothbrush is advised.  The Braun brand of  electric toothbrush comes highly recommended 
because it comes with a smaller head than ma ny others and can be more localized to the 
area you want to brush, it doesn't vibrat e much, and is easy to control.   
Stay away from mouthwashes with alcohol .  Alcohol causes drying, which results in 
adverse effects to gums.  Most bacteria that  cause bad breath are on the tongue, and it's OK 
to dip the toothbrush into a mouthwash that has alcohol and brush the tongue.  
Saliva doesn't flow much when we're sleep ing.  So if and when you wake up in the 
middle of the night for a feeding you'll need to give the teeth a nother quick brushing. 
Dentists are recommending you keep your toothb rush in a medicine chest or in a room 
other than the bathroom because flushing the to iled aerates bacteria that can land on your 
toothbrush. 
And of course, see your dentist regularly a nd have a cleaning at least once every six 
months.   I have found that taking some i buprofen before a cleaning will reduce any 
potential discomfort.  And of course, gr eat home care will reduce the need for the 
discomfort of cleaning and dental work. 
 
Mercury Fillings 
While there may be some validity that mercur y fillings emit some harmful mercury gas, 
it is costly to remove and replace them, and the process is fraught with complications.  
Long term studies are lacking.  The vacuum extraction process requires a special hood, and 
drilling them out releases mercury.   
So there's another reason to take care of those toothies.  Until we figure out away to 
genetically engineer new ones, they're all you'll get.  
 
Posture  
There is a feedback system between the position of your body and your body’s 
chemical and emotional states.  This effects your physical health, and especially the health 
of your brain and mind. 
Craning the neck forward can cause neck, shoulder and arm pain along with headaches 
and dizziness.  Rounded shoulders may cause back and neck strain.  Overall postural 
imbalance can cause fatigue, joint pain, neuriti s, sciatica and pain throughout the entire 
body.   
Strong abdominal and back muscles develope d by proper weight training can help you 
maintain proper, healthy posture. 
So sit and stand straight with the head di rectly above the line  parallel with your 
shoulders, and with your shoulders back.  This  will help with your br eathing.  If you work 
182 with a computer, see the discussion on ergonom ics in the "Reduce Risks and Stay Safe" 
section.  
 
Clothing 
You'll feel better in natu ral fibers, like cotton.  
 
Our Animal Friends 
Ya gotta just love those dogs , cats, raccoons, llamas -- all our animal friends, even the 
ones who aren't so cute and cuddly.  Kind of hard  for me to warm up to goats, they seem to 
butt me a lot.  It has been reported that blood pressure drops when stroking a dog or a cat, 
and they seem to like it too.  Also, seniors w ith pets are reported to have fewer health 
problems and less visits to the doctor. It's worth the hair and clean ing up an occasional 
mess.  Sure does hurt when it's time for them to go to pet heaven.  But it's worth it.  
One more thing, let me preach a bit and ju st remind ourselves that animals have 
feelings too.  If you're going to have a pet, pl ease be sure you are rea dy to take care of it -- 
and for the eventual veterinarian bills.  As st ewards of the world we have a responsibility to 
not inflict suffering on them.  Spay and neuter  your pets, and for gosh sakes please don't 
dump them on an Animal Shelter or Humane Society if you can no longer care for them.  
Imagine what it would be like to sit there in a cramped cage listen ing to a lot of loud 
yapping.  You may be assured that they will be  adopted, but don't necessarily believe it -- 
most of them are put to death.  Some hints on pet care can be found at the Humane Society 
site at http://www.hsus.org/ace/12531 . 
 
How to Find a Really Good Doctor 
Antiaging medicine is not yet a recognized sp ecialty and a good pract itioner is immensely 
hard to find.  It took me a long time of tria l and painful error to find Dr. Lee-Benner. So 
this applies to finding specialists in areas where you may have a specific medical problem 
or a disease.  Most medical practitioners follow fairly stan dard methods of diagnosis and 
treatment.  A few are very bad, and a few are very good.  You want the very best, even for 
seemingly minor ailments.  The very best will know how to handle the minor problems 
most quickly effectively, and they will be best  able to identify serious problems that may 
have gone undetected.  Local newspapers some times publish surveys of the "best" doctors 
in the area.  Typically they are marketi ng information gleaned from county medical 
societies which, of course, want to promote thei r members.  This is their only criteria for 
who are the "Best Doctors". A doctor who teaches in a medical school is usua lly a good bet.  They tend to be current on 
the latest medical technologies , leading the others in private practice by many years.  Also, 
they can be among the smartest and less likely to be swayed by the procedures that are the 
most profitable. The best doctors are typically involved in research.  A number of years ago when I 
discovered I had glaucoma, I was motivated to find not only the best ophthalmologist 
around, but one who specialized in the kind of gl aucoma that I had (pigmentary glaucoma).  
I did a search on the "Medline" database.  Me dline is a National Library of Medicine 
system that categorizes medical research, and tracks an immense number of studies.   My 
search turned up Dr. Schaffer of the Universi ty of CA San Francisco.   That's several 
hundred miles from  me and a little far travel, so I called up there and asked  if they knew 
of someone in the Southern California area.  Dr. Donald Minckler of the world class 
Doheny Eye Clinic had trained wi th Dr. Schaffer.   So I got together with him, and ever 
since I've been getting world-class treatment.   
183 Back then I had to go to a medical library to  use it, and it was kind of complicated.  It's 
now available on the web, it's eas ier to use and it's free at www.nlm.nih.gov , or go directly 
to Medline's PubMed at:

Alternative Medicine  
Alternative medicine should be approached w ith caution.  Caveat em ptor (Let the buyer 
beware).  Alternative medicine can be define d as therapeutic (healing) practices which are 
not currently considered an integral part of c onventional allopathic medi cal practice.   They 
may lack biomedical explanations, but some , as they become be tter researched (like 
physical therapy, diet, acupuncture) become wi dely accepted and others (radium therapy, 
humors) fall into disrepute.  "Complemen tary" therapies are used in addition to 
conventional treatments and alternative ther apies are used instead of conventional 
treatment.   
Alternative medical therapies range from more familiar sounding methods such as 
herbal therapy, acupuncture and yoga -- to m oonbeam therapy.  They run the range of 
innovative and scientifically  proven methods of credible  professionals, to offbeat 
treatments with unusual sounding names and  questionable scientific  evidence, down to 
those offered by practitioners who go to a week end seminar then hang out their shingles, or 
decide to sell some worthless yet highly profitable product.   
Herbs and tonics are often like drugs and can  have powerful, and undesirable, chemical 
effects.   
Although many alternative therapies are now be ing evaluated in leading hospitals and 
research institutions by conventionally traine d physicians, a great many have not been 
evaluated in controlled studies , so their effectiveness is debated.  And even effective 
products or therapies can be worthless or da maging if misapplied.  And by investing your 
hard-earned dollars and your va luable time in therapies that don't work you are not 
spending your money and your time in things that will. 
In 1998 the National Institutes of  Health turned its Office of  Alternative Medicine into 
the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine -- and increased the 
budget from $2 million to $100 million.  
Some alternative therapies can reduce the effectiveness of conventional therapies. 
Your aging intervention or conventional physic ian should be able to help you evaluate 
alternative therapies and you should di scuss them with him or her.   
Several organizations provide information on alternative treatments.  The American 
Cancer Society publishes an Complementar y and Alternative Cancer Methods Handbook.

 Many of the concerns and words of caution discussed in the s ection on nutritional 
supplements apply to alternative medical treatm ent.   Many alternativ e practitioners have a 
bias (or even greater bias than  their conventional counterparts) .  They often are not critical 
of their therapies and find evidence to support their bias where there is none.  My opinion 
is that the field  of alternative medicine is overrun with self-styled experts, and my personal 
experiences have been mostly negative.   
Alpha and theta brain waves are associated with restfulness, creativity and sleep. The 
idea was to entrain the brain to a slower brain wave frequency so that you can enter a more 
relaxed, peaceful state.  I once went to a practitioner who used  a system with lights affixed 
to goggles that flashed at the same rate as alpha and theta brain waves (brain waves are 
oscillating electrical voltages in the brain).  I told him to set the syst em on "relax", but he 
set it on "psychedelic".  After a half hour of this I left feeling dizzy.   
One female attorney who has been active in aging intervention in her practice 
developed breast cancer.  An alternative medical practitione r with a questionable therapy 
told her that this therapy wa s all that was needed, and to forgo conventional treatment.  
Surely this course of action would have killed her. 
Last week I had a conversation with an alternative practiti oner who was selling a 
nutritional supplement.  I asked for evidence th at it would provide he alth benefits.  He 
adopted an aggressive posture a nd replied that a doctor had creat ed it, but confided that he 
was now dead.  I commented "It didn't save hi m." He replied "He lived a lot longer than he 
185 would have without it."  Snappy comeback, but  no evidence.  I bit my tongue and did not 
reply "Probably too much of his own product."   He left me with the revelation that he was 
on the cutting edge of medicine.  Again I b it my tongue -- he's on the cutting edge of 
confusion.

Quack Spotting 
While some quacks are thoroughly unprincipl ed ("ethically challenged"), most are 
well-meaning but just don't recognize their in eptitude.  Ones who are mad at the system 
may lack the skills to work within  it.  "Take some of this and mo re of that, and this and this 
and this, and more of that."  Next thi ng you know you're a walking toxic waste dump. 
Some define a quack as anyone who fraudulently  pretends to medical skills they do not 
possess. They distinguish among three type s: dumb quacks (ignorant), deluded quacks 
(self-righteous, true believers), and lastly dishonest quacks (ge nuine con artists, confidence 
men, swindlers, mountebanks, or grifters). Th ey go on to outline thirty ways to spot a 
quack, including  
1) exclusive reliance on anecdotes and testimoni als in support of extravagant claims;  
2) display of unrecogni zed credentials;  
3) claims that they are persecuted by ort hodox medicine or that their work is 
suppressed because it is controversial;  
4)  intimidation of their critics due to th reats of law suits or litigation;   
5) encouragement of patients to use their pol itical support to public ize their treatment 
methods; and  
6) charismatic individuals capable of exploi ting any "placebo effect" to the maximum 
advantage.  
Item 6 above is actually a good thing.  
Many doctors of this type, having no rigorous controlled animal or clinical trials to support 
their claims, can still attract thousands of patie nts and are treated as heroes.  Improvements 
are often a result of the "P lacebo Effect".  A placebo is something that has no 
pharmacological effect on the condition for which it is used, but the patient believes it to be 
a medicine.  The Placebo Effect is when patients sometimes have significant improvements or cures to their diseases for no medical reas on.  It is often attri buted to the connection 
between the mind and the immune system .  Such is the power of the mind. 
Sometimes after a period of time the body will heal itself without medical treatment.  For 
example, in the case of tumors there ar e sometimes spontaneous remissions with no 
treatment at all.  Sometimes, for reasons not fully understood, the immune surveillance 
system suddenly "wakes up" af ter the patient's tumor mass exceeds a critical threshold and 
"cures" him or her, in spite of, rather th an because of, the aggressive radiation and 
chemotherapeutic treatments provided by unw itting oncologists.  Spontaneous remissions 
can be the result of the placebo effect. 
 
The Power of Placebo 
 
Placebo Defined  
The "placebo effect" has a number of definitions: 
186 
  The placebo effect is the measurable, observable, or felt improvement in health not 
attributable to treatment. This effect is be lieved by many people to be due to the placebo 
itself in some mysterious way.  
   A beneficial response to a substance, device, or procedure that cannot be accounted 
for on the basis of pharmacologic or other di rect physical action. Feeling better when the 
physician walks into the room is a common example.  
   Some holistic researcher s say that the placebo does not  cause anything in the body, it 
triggers its natural response, which is defined as the healing force of nature. 
   Alternatively, it has been defined as a non-medication, or inactiv e treatment that is 
used to satisfy a patient's psychological need for medicine.  
   Another definition is: "a dummy treatme nt administered to the control group in a 
controlled clinical trial in orde r that the specific and non specifi c effect of the experimental 
treatment can be distinguished" 
 
Placebos in Action 
The word itself is derived from the Latin word placebo , which means "I shall please." 
The patient expects the "medication" to cau se improvement, and sometimes it does.  Many 
studies suggest that placebos can relieve a broad range of symptoms. In many disorders, 
one third or more of patients will get re lief from a placebo. Temporary relief has been 
demonstrated, for example, in arthritis, ha y fever, headache, cough, high blood pressure, 
premenstrual tension, peptic  ulcer, and even cancer.  
In these and other diseases, tension is often a contributi ng factor.  So lessening of 
tension often helps.  A sympat hetic ear or reassurance that no serious disease is involved 
can be therapeutic in itself.  
Confidence, hopefulness and ent husiasm in the treatment on th e part of the patient and 
the practitioner makes it more likely that a placebo effect will happen.   
Researchers have found that when patients using placebos experience relief from pain, 
their own brains are releasing endorphins that  help relieve the pa in.  Other studies on 
depression show that 45 percent of the pe ople who improve while using a placebo show 
measurable changes in brain chemistry.  One recent study showed that a placebo helped improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
People suffering from chronic symptoms ar e often depressed, and depression often 
produces symptoms that the patient attributes to the disease itself.  If a practitioner's 
suggestions make the patient hopeful, the de pressive symptoms may resolve leading the 
patient to believe (at least temporarily) that  the approach has been effective against the 
disease.  
A person's beliefs and expectations about a treatment, combined with how suggestible 
they are, may have a biochemical effect that affects their neurochemistry. The body's 
neurochemical system affects and is affected  by other biochemical systems, including the 
immune and hormone systems.  So a person' s hopeful attitude and beliefs may be very 
important to their physical well-being, as well as their recovery from illness and injury.  
But a part of the behavior of a "sick" person is learned (as well as part of the behavior 
of a person in pain).  This is not as faking it, or malingering.  The placebo may play a part 
in their changing the role they're play ing, and again affect their chemistry. 
Some studies suggest that pr oblems with vague causes, like the fatigue or aches, 
respond better than those resulting from obvi ous structural damage, like broken bones. 
187 Danish scientists have studied the differen ces in effects between clinical trial groups 
that receive the medication being studied, as well as a placebo and no medication at all.  
They found that the improvements in the pati ents who received a placebo and no treatment 
were often the same -- leading them to w onder whether people who improve on placebos 
would do as well without any medication. 
 
One EXTREME Example of Placebo 
It was in the 1950s.  To test the effectiven ess of a new surgical treatment for angina 
(chest pain), surgeons at the University of Kansas Medical Center performed real 
operations on one group of patients, and "placeb o" or "sham" operations" on another group.   
In this extreme experiment the group of placeb o patients were told that they were going to 
have heart surgery and were given a local an esthetic and incisions were made in their 
chests.  But no real therapeutic procedure wa s performed -- the surgeon simply worked his 
hands around in the chest wall fo r show.  The patients left the hospital with scars and with 
pain from the incisions, and with no reason to believe they had not undergone the real 
surgery.  Seventy percent of the patients w ho had the real surger y reported long-term 
improvement, but all the placebo patients did.  Many placebo pa tients declared themselves 
fully cured and returned to physically demanding jobs.  
 
Other Effects of Placebo 
Response to the treatment can also be negativ e ("nocebo effects").  In one experiment 
some subjects were warned of possible side eff ects of a drug were then  given injections of 
a placebo.  Many of them reported dizziness,  nausea, vomiting, and even depression. A 
recent review of 109 double-blind drug trials found that the overall incidence of adverse 
events in healthy volunteers duri ng placebo administration was 19%.  
The placebo effect may also result from various procedures, devices and physical 
techniques.  Chiropractors, naturopaths, and various other nonmedi cal practitioners may 
use heat, light, diathermy, hydrotherapy, mani pulation, massage, and various gadgets. In 
addition to any physiologic effects, their us e can exert a psychologi c force that may be 
reinforced by the relationship between the pa tient and the practitioner. Of course, devices 
and procedures used by scientific practi tioners can also have placebo effects.  
For example, vitamins used as placebos may not be as dangerous in the short term, but 
the habitual use of products that are not needed can be.  
 
Psychological and Physiological Implications of Placebo 
By lessening anxiety, placebo action may relieve symptoms caused by the body's 
reaction to tension (psychosoma tic symptoms). In certain circumstances, a lactose tablet 
(sugar pill) may relieve not only anxiety but also pain, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, 
shortness of breath, and other symptoms.  
The American Journal of Psychiatry  published a the first-of-i ts-kind study suggesting 
that patients with major depression who r eceive placebos experience changes in brain 
function similar to changes caused by medi cation.  The double blind study conducted by 
UCLA researchers used quantit ative electroencephalography or  QEEG imaging to look at 
brain activity in 51 patients who were assigned to receive either placebos or one of two 
antidepressant medications.  Afte r nine weeks, patients were cl assified as being medication 
responders, placebo responders, or non-responders to  either medication or placebos.   "The 
placebo responders and the medication responders  had changes in the same brain region," 
says Dr. Andrew Leuchter, lead author of the study and director of a dult psychiatry at the 
188 UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute and Hospital.   Placebo responders showed more activity 
in the prefrontal cortex while medication re sponders showed less ac tivity. Additionally, the 
decrease in depression with the placebo was th e same as the improvement with medication. 
 
Here's the Bottom Line on the Placebo Effect 
If it works, it can be a GREAT idea to use it.  
But . . . often when someone responds to pl acebo in the short-term, the effect doesn't 
last.  And, placebo responses, like feeling less pain or having more energy, may not affect 
the actual cause and course of the disease.  Placebo responses can obscure real disease, 
which can lead to delay in obtaining a ppropriate diagnosis or treatment.  
 
Health Insurance 
Health insurance can mean the difference between getting medical treatment when you 
need it, and not getting it.  Obviously, you need  high quality health insurance.  Do what 
you need to do in order to get it and keep it.   
An indemnity plan (also known as fee-for-s ervice, or FFS) allows you to go to any 
medical provider.  PPO (Preferred Provider Or ganization) plans combine some aspects of 
both Indemnity and HMO plans.   HMOs are li ked by the extremely cost conscious and are 
discussed in the next section.  Although ma ny good practitioners are providers for PPOs, 
ideally you will have PPO coverage that also pays something for any provider.  But often 
they will cover only around 50% or so.   Coverage with a hi gher deductible will be at a 
lower rate and is often preferred, and will cover you in case of catastrophic illness.  
Major insurance carriers negotiate much lower rates for things like lab work, so even if 
you're paying on the deductible out of your own poc ket it can be at a smaller percentage of 
the cost. 
Cost of care can go into the millions of do llars and today the maximum amount is an 
important consideration.  Having at leas t $2,000,000 maximum is a advised, but around 
$5,000,000 is better. 
Companies offer health care coverage as part  of their compensation package in order to 
attract and retain employees.  But consider what will happen when you get laid off, and 
have developed what will be a pre-existing condition with regard to your next health 
insurance coverage?  CORBA (Consolidated Om nibus Reconciliation Act) could provide a 
short-term safety net, but it's expensive and doe sn't last long.  At best there will be a 
waiting period for pre-existing conditions on your next coverage, but more likely it will be 
excluded altogether. 
You can often get health in surance at attractive rates through trade or professional 
associations, union or school  alumni organization.  
Study and understand the information on your he alth insurance, and pay attention to 
details like when forms are due for submission, etc.   
But sometimes a health insurance card from even a budget, no-name carrier can mean 
the difference between being admitted into a hospital or getting care when you need it, or 
not.   Someone once advised me that if you ar e really sick and home less or living in your 
car, if you show up at a majo r medical center or hospital that you can get treatment. 
See the appendix for more information on health insurance. 
 
189 HMOs 
This reminds me of the old joke about not wan ting to ride in an ai rplane that was built 
by the lowest bidder.  HMOs are based on cost  reduction and denial of service. HMOs are 
the junk food of health care.  They’re cheap, and fast too -- many HMO doctors are 
frustrated because they must  treat six patients per hour. 
I often hear “I’m only having such and such treatments because that’s all my insurance 
will pay for.”  What sense does this make wh en dealing with your most important asset – 
your health, and therefore you. 
Don't get me wrong -- I am sure that almost  all employees of HMOs are compassionate 
professionals.  But treatment is often dictated by administrators. I wouldn't be surprised if 
they begin drive-thru service soon to save mo re money.  But their top executives are paid 
millions each year.   
I think that next to the implementation of the health, fitness and antiaging system, the 
selection of medical insuran ce (and therefore selection of  health care system and 
professionals) is one of the most important health decisions a pers on will make. Volumes 
are written about the ins & outs of medical insurance, and find ing affordable insurance is a 
challenge -- particularly if you have a pre-existing condition.  I personally belong to plan 
with a $1000 deductible.   It's  a PPO but allows members do see doctors outside of their 
network.  Originally it paid for 70% of the co st of the out-of-network doctors but recently 
that was dropped to only 50%.  Rarely will I see a doctor within the network, so the cost of this plan is high.  But I won't be a member of a medical plan which does not allow me to 
select the best doctor, an d I won't go near an HMO. 
The following sections are not medical or scie ntific, so were not reviewed as such.  
 
Reduce Risks to Live Longer and Better  
Picture this: You're out for a Sunday driv e with your family.  Laughing, maybe even 
singing.  Life is good.  Not care in the world . . . then Whammo!  Out of nowhere a drunk 
driver plows into your car. So me of your family members are lucky, some are dead.  You 
wake up paralyzed in hospital -- for the rest of  your life.  Try just  laying there not moving 
for a few hours like a quadraplegic or rolling around in a wheelchair for a day or so like a 
paraplegic sometime to get a hint of this experience.  
Yup, pretty grisly.  But it's happened to  many, many people. I've personally known a 
number of them.  Just ask Christopher Reeve and a host of others w hose lives have been 
turned around in an instant.  
You may know someone who has had a life-sh attering event.  I've known quite a few, 
which proves how often it happens.  The result -- paralysis, permanent disability, immense 
pain for the rest of their (could be your) life.  And it can happen in an instant. 
To get just a brief slice of the life of a qua draplegic, for example, try laying in bed for 
an hour or two, and just don't move.  Have so meone turn you when you get uncomfortable.  
Have them help you go to the bathroom (reme mber, you can't move).  Of course this 
exercise is entirely inadequate to  understand what it would be like. 
Safety and reducing risks are often overlooke d in components of an antiaging system.  
But some of the greatest causes of serious inju ry are things like auto accidents and falling 
off of an unstable stool while changing a light  bulb.  Here are some ideas on how to avoid 
bone and life-shattering events, as well as th e daily occurrences that slowly wear you 
down. 
190 Use common sense, and pay attention to your intuition regarding safety in any 
situation. 
 
Some Defensive Driving Tips 
   It's easy to forget that while drivin g, we're hurling down the pavement in machines 
made of steel, glass and rubber -- and that either striking or being struck by other large 
machines can tear us to pieces. So staying se parated from other large machines (defensive 
driving) is obvious.   
   Insist that everyone in your  car wear their seat belt.   
   Always drive defensively.  Consider taking into our refresh or driv ing course or study a 
book  on the subject. 
   Don't follow other drivers too closely -- allow at least one car length for each 10 mph 
you are traveling.  
   Look down the road -- get the big picture. 
   Leave yourself a way out -- away from cars and from potential accident situations. 
   Drive a safe car, not a tin can. 
   Stay alert -- don't drive drowsy. 
   Always use your turn signals and brake lights to signal your intentions. 
   Make sure you have plenty of room when you want to merge. 
   Don't drink or use drugs (pre scription or otherwise) and drive 
   Allow more time for your trip. Instead of trying to "make good time," try to "make time 
good."    
   Pull over and stop your car  to use a cellular phone 
   Let irate drivers pass you.  Don't get mad.  
 
Top Reasons Why Good Drivers Get Injured or  Killed According to the National Safety 
Council 
   Head-on Collision -- caused by drivers passing at the wrong time and happens around 
curves.  But mostly happen when drivers ar e following a straight path, usually in dry 
weather, day or night.  Probably a result of be ing distracted -- by kids , changing a tape or 
CD, or talking on a cell phone.  Safest highway s are ones with center dividers or spaces, 
and where there are on and off ramps.  
   At a STOP sign -- other drivers failed to stop.  Be extra careful at intersections.  Make 
sure the other car is stopping and look at the ot her driver to see that they are not distracted 
and sees you.  
   A majority of accidents happen on side ro ads and "byways" -- st ick to major highways 
when you can.  
   Serious accidents, and resulting deaths, happen in places as apparently unlikely as 
parking lots, in driveways, at unmarked side  roads and shopping center parking lots.  This 
often happens where there are no stop signs or traffic lights,  
   By drivers running a red light.  Even when your light has turned to green, take one more 
look both ways to be sure no one is coming.   I ha ve my own real life tale about this one.  I 
used to have a small sports car.  One night ( it happened to be raining, but this would have 
been the same if it weren't) I was stopped at a red light.  The light turned green, but due to a 
glitch in the clutch it stopped temporarily.  Just as I got  rolling a HUGE ca r (travelling so 
fast I couldn't tell what kind it was) barreled through the intersection from left to right, and 
right in front of me.  It mu st have been doing 60, and I don't think it had it's lights on.  So, 
191 dear reader, had it not been fo r lucky intervening glitch in the clutch, you just wouldn't be 
reading this.  
 
Road Rage  
   Watch out for people with road rage -- and don't be a road rager yourself.    
   Don’t slam on the brakes if someone’s ta ilgating you, just signal, pull over to let them 
pass. If you are in the left lane and someone wants to pass, move over to the right and let 
him or her by.  
   If someone cuts you off, slow down and give  the car plenty of room to merge into your 
lane. Just send them unconditional love.   
   Don’t offend other drivers. Remember, you may be "right" because you’re traveling at 
the speed limit, but you can also be putting yourself in danger by enraging someone behind 
you -- don't be "dead right".    
   Keep as much distance as possible betw een yourself and another driver who wants to 
pick a fight.  Motorists you might have offende d can "snap" at any time, so don't let your 
ego get you into trouble.  
   Give the other motorist the benefit of the doubt. A driver who’s speeding or constantly 
changing lanes may be a volunteer fireman re sponding to a call, a physician rushing to a 
hospital or an undercover cop.   
   For too many motorists, driving become s a contest. Forget about winning, listen to 
soothing music or a book on tape. Seek help if  you have a problem with aggressive drivers 
or if you yourself are getting angrier behind th e wheel. Courses in anger management have 
been shown to reduc e heart attacks.  
See the appendix for more information on safe driving. 
 
Safe Home Checklist 
   Surprisingly, falling off of chairs is a ma jor source of injury a nd death while changing 
light bulbs, cleaning high places, etc -- so use a step ladder to reach those high places and 
make sure you are well balanced and don't use the upper steps. 
   Keep fire extinguishers nearby.  Unless you have a special kind of environment, ones 
that are rated for class A, B and C fires are us ually the most appropriate.  When things are 
happening quickly in an emergency, most peopl e have great difficulty in using a fire 
extinguisher.  Practice so that you and your fa mily can use them quickly.  Also be aware 
that different fire extinguishers are rated for different kinds of fires, so use the right kind of 
fire extinguisher for a particular kind of fi re, and keep a multi-purpose extinguisher nearby. 
   Post emergency telephone numbers by every telephone -- numbers should be clear 
enough and large enough to be easily read from a distance in an emergency.   
   Keep a first aid kit and emergency guide handy, and know how to deal with 
emergencies such as choking, bleedi ng, burns and poisoning in advance. 
   Install smoke detectors and test them regularly. 
   Store flammable materials away from th e furnace, fireplace, and other heat sources. 
   Never leave fire unattended. 
   Don't let anyone smoke in bed -- or anywhere else for that matter. 
   Inspect electrical equipmen t regularly -- replace frayed or cracked electrical cords, and 
broken sockets and plugs.   
   Lock up drugs and hazardous materials out of children's reach. 
   Keeps stairs, sidewalks and hall ways well lit a cl ear of clutter. 
   Follow the manufacturers recommendations fo r the safe use and maintenance of power 
tools. 
   Beware of overhead power lines when  trimming trees or installing antennas. 
192 
   Fumes can build up and confined areas ar ound the home with toxic substances are used.  
Take precautions. 
   A kitchen tends to stock pollutants a nd environmentally harmful products alongside 
devices like appliances, can openers and utensils .  Food that is stored, prepared, and eaten 
in a chemical-laden space can soak up toxins. 
   Black mold can be a cause of toxicity, part icularly in sensitive pe ople.  (see section on 
black mold below)   See the appendix for more information on home safety.  
 
First Aid Basics  
According to the American Red Cross, if you encounter someone who is injured, apply the 
emergency action steps: Check-Call-Care. Check the scene to make sure it is safe for you 
to approach. Then check the victim for unconsciousness and life-th reatening conditions. 
Someone who has a life-threa tening condition, such as not breathing or severe bleeding, 
requires immediate care by trained responders  and may require treatment by medical 
professionals. Call out for help. There are some steps that you can take, however, to care 
for someone who is hurt, but whose injuries are not life threatening.  
 
Control Bleeding  
Cover the wound with a dressing, and press firmly against th e wound (direct pressure).  
Elevate the injured area above the level of the he art if you do not suspect that the victim 
has a broken bone.  Cover the dressing with a roller bandage.  If the bleeding does not stop:  Apply additional dressings and bandages.  
Use a pressure point to squeeze the artery against the bone.  
Provide care for shock.  Care for Shock   
Keep the victim from getting chilled or overheated.  
Elevate the legs about 12 inches (if broken bones are not suspected).  
Do not give food or dr ink to the victim.  
Tend Burns   
Stop the burning by cooling the burn with large amounts of water.  
Cover the burn with dry, clean dressings or cloth.  
Care for Injuries to Muscles, Bones and Joints   
Rest the injured part.  
Apply ice or a cold pack to c ontrol swelling and reduce pain.  
Avoid any movement or activity that causes pain.  If you must move the victim because the scene is becoming unsafe, try to immobilize the 
injured part to k eep it from moving.  
 
Be Aware of Biological/Radiological Exposure  
Listen to local radio and television reports  for the most accurate information from 
responsible governmental and medical author ities on what's happening and what actions 
you will need to take.   
Reduce Any Care Risks 
193 The risk of getting a disease while giving first aid is extremely rare. However, to reduce the 
risk even further:  Avoid direct contact with blood and other body fluids.  
Use protective equipment, such as dis posable gloves and breathing barriers.  
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap a nd water immediately after giving care.  
 
Remodeling the Home 
   Remodeling a home presents special health ha zards from the toxic fumes, dust, etc.  One 
excellent method is for the work area to be se aled off with plastic sh eeting and tape, with a 
negative pressure system that uses a fan to  draw the contaminants out through a vent. 
   Inexpensive materials are often more toxic than those that cost more money.  
   Avoid enamel paint if at all possible.  Wa ter based paint is less t oxic -- but be aware that 
many of these, particularly inexpensive ones, are more toxic.  One professional 
maintenance man mentioned to me that the Evr-Gard and Schreuder brands were lower 
than most others. 
   Carpteing has been a major contributor to toxic effects -- and partic ularly the liner used 
underneath. 
   One person I heard of had marble tiles in stalled instead of carpet -- unfortunately the 
adhesive used to hold them down turned out to  be more toxic than the carpet and liner! 
   The National Association of th e Remodeling Industry web site at http://www.nari.org/  
can give you a lot of cons truction-related information, and on hiring a contractor. 
   New federal guidelines are under developm ent to determine how contractors should 
handle and dispose of lead laden material s during remodeling or renovation.  You can 
contact your local health department for referrals to profe ssionals trained in lead detection 
and removal. Use only inspectors certified by your state or local government's health 
department, the EPA or those with The Lead  Listing organization sanctioned by the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development' s (HUD) Office of Lead Hazard Control.  
A trained inspector will use a portable X-ray fluorescence machine to measure the amount 
of lead in the paint or will send samples to a certified lab. Don't count on do-it-yourself test 
kits for definitive results. Their sensitivity is limited and it may be difficult to get accurate 
readings on surfaces with multiple layers of  paint. (see section on lead paint below) 
   If you are about to perform major renova tions which involve tearing out materials, 
consider determining if asbestos is present firs t.  But if disturbed, it can release microscopic 
asbestos fibers that are hazardous (see section on asbestos below). 
   Improper construction can result in black mold -- building materials should be kept dry 
to prevent mold, and other measures shoul d be taken (see the section on black mold 
below). 
   Do not hesitate to question a contractor or repairman about their qualifications to deal 
with hazardous materials.  
Workplace Checklist 
   Hazards in the workplace are often caused by the use of materials, tools, machinery and 
chemicals -- and people! 
   Notify all co-workers of hazards 
   Ensure that you and all team members follo w established safety procedures and policies. 
   Always wear appropriate safety eyewear , clothing, footwear and protective equipment. 
   Be aware of, and follow all safety pract ices specific to your occupation and industry. 
   Maintain ongoing safety education. 
194 
   Study and thoroughly understand safety in formation for any piece of equipment you 
operate. 
   Safety is everybody's job. 
   All of the tips in the other secti ons above and below apply to the Workplace. 
 
Carcinogens and Toxins  
Everyday our bodies are bombarded with t oxins and carcinogens .  These cancer-
causing substances include the ingredients in household cleaners, pesticides, automobile 
emissions, food additives, tobacco and other kinds of smoke, industrial pollutants.  As 
described in the first chapter, toxins can change base pairs, and they can add or subtract 
base pairs to your DNA.  This amounts to rewr iting your DNA, and as a result the gene that 
has been rewritten cannot code or express itse lf properly, or cause a cell to multiply out of 
control.  So avoid them, and put this system  into practice in order to combat them.  
Toxins can be ingested by ea ting or drinking hazardous s ubstances or contaminated 
food and water, and can be inhaled in the form of gases, vapors, and sprays. Toxins can be 
absorbed through the skin if you come in  contact with haza rdous substances.  
Avoid aerosol products. Aerosol disperses the substance in tiny droplets than can be 
inhaled deeply into the lungs and absorbed into the bloodstrea m. In addition, aerosol cans 
may become explosive bombs when heated.  
Read all labels carefully before using h azardous products. Be aware of their uses and 
dangers, and use proper safety equi pment when working with them.  
Leave products in their original containers with the label that clearly identifies the 
contents. And never put hazardous products  in food or beverage containers.  
Don't mix products unless directed to do so by label directions. Mixing can cause toxic 
and even explosive chemical reactions. Even  different brands of the same product can 
contain incompatible ingredients.  
Follow label directions regard ing proper use and amounts. Us e only what is needed for 
a job. More product doesn't  mean more results.  
 
Guidelines For Safe Disposal of Toxic Products 
This info applies to househol d use only -- different sets of laws often apply to 
businesses. 
Dispose of hazardous wastes properly -- we  already have too much toxins in our 
environment.  Recommendations for proper di sposal will depend upon both the particular 
type of waste and the waste disposal opti ons available in your community. Local laws 
pertaining to disposal may vary. For example, landfill owners have the right to decide what 
they will and will not accept for disposal. As  a general rule, liquids containing hazardous 
substances (paint for example) are discour aged in landfills as they create hazardous 
leachate which may contaminate the groundwat er. If in doubt, check with your local 
officials for what is appropr iate in your community.  
When products are fully used up as intended there is no hazardous waste to dispose of. 
If you only need a small amount of paint, pest icide, or other hazardous product, check with 
friends, relatives, or neighbors to  see if they have any excess th ey are trying to use up. Be a 
wise consumer. Buy only the amount you need and look for safer alternatives whenever 
possible.  
195 When Throwing In The Trash -- When it is r ecommended that a waste be thrown into 
the trash, it means the final destination is  the landfill. No other dumping, burning, or 
burying of hazardous waste is safe or legal. Trash disposal of hazardous materials which 
are flammable, explosive/reactive, corrosive/ ca ustic, radioactive, or toxic can cause health 
risks to waste handlers and an environmental haza rd if toxicants leach from the landfill into 
the groundwater. Be very careful about what you throw away and if you have any doubts, 
make sure that your waste handler knows the s ubstance is in there a nd be certain it is 
securely wrapped.  
Objects that can puncture skin, such as hypodermic needles, broken glass, and metal 
shards, are known as a "sharps." Sharps shoul d be placed in a rigid, puncture- resistant 
container. Seal the container with heavy tape  and place in the trash. Large breakable items, 
such as fluorescent light bulbs, should be pl aced alongside your trash container. These 
actions will help trash haulers avoid injury.  
Some of the hazardous wastes which are ac ceptable at some landfills include empty 
aerosol cans, autobody repair products, fert ilizer (without pesticides), shoe polish, 
crystallized oven cleaner, empty and triple-rinsed pesticide containers  
If solidified, these products may also be acceptable -- paints, adhesives and epoxies, 
nail polish, solvent-based polishes, so lvent-based cleaners and thinners. 
Some household hazardous wastes that can be  flushed down the drai n (the toilet is 
recommended) with plenty of water -- (not e: this recommendation is given when the 
hazardous waste is neutralized by water or when  the municipal or sanitary sewage system 
is able to remove the toxins or render them  harmless. If you use a septic system or lagoon, 
it is preferable to give hazardous waste acc eptable for flushing to a friend who is on a 
sanitary sewage treatment system. Heavy concen trations of certain chemicals in a septic 
tank can slow down or destroy th e microorganisms which make th e system work properly).   
If flushing down the drain, take  the following precautions:  
- If you have any doubts, call your local  wastewater treatment plant.  
- Never pour any chemicals down a basement dr ain or storm sewer; these lead directly 
into the waterways.  
- Make sure there is adequate  ventilation in the area where you are flushing the waste.  
- Avoid disposal of chemical wast es in food preparation areas.  
- Never mix chemicals together either while pour or when th ey are in the stool or sink. 
Wait at least two to three hours between flushing ammonia and flushing bleach.  
- Wear gloves and goggles when disposing of wastes to avoid eye and skin contact. 
Pour slowly and carefully  to avoid splashing.  
- Flush wastes during the working day so th at waste will be carried quickly through the 
system and will not be left in the sewer system overnight.  
- Flush wastes using a large volume of water.  - Rinse the empty container with wa ter before placing in the trash.  
 
Lead 
Typically, the older the home, the higher th e concentration of l ead-based paint and 
contaminated soil. Higher contamination means higher risk. Soils can also be a source of 
contamination. Paint breaks down into a chal ky, powdery substance as it ages and these 
tiny particles accumulate in the soil around the house.  
196 According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, homes and apartments built 
before 1978 almost always contain some lead -based paint, which when disturbed can 
release toxic dust and fumes. 
According to the Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention, in adults, lead can 
decrease learning ability, cause hearing loss, high blood pressure, muscle aches, joint pain, 
lower sperm count, and early death.  If you have, or suspect you have, lead-based paint in 
your home, it is important to have young children under 6 tested by your physician or local health department. For kids, when it comes to toxins, lead is considered the worst offender 
-- especially for infants and t oddlers, who put a lot of things  in their mouths. Children's 
bodies absorb lead more readily than adults, a nd children who inhale or ingest lead run the 
risk of developing motor coordination problems,  reading disabilities, vocabulary deficits, 
hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder (ADD).  
According to the EPA's National Lead Info rmation Center, you should not attempt to 
remove lead based paint by dry sanding, scrapi ng, brushing or blasti ng. These techniques 
can generate dust which is toxic when inhaled. Lead-based paint is pa rticularly hazardous 
when burned. The fumes contain lead and othe r toxins which are poisonous when inhaled. 
What is recommended is regular damp moping, dust control, picking up loose paint chips 
with duct tape and frequent washing of your  child's hands and toys to help reduce 
exposure. Vacuuming, on the other hand, can di sperse dust particles back into the room. 
The Federal Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 requires that 
when you sell your home, you or your agent disclose known or potential lead hazards in any residential property built before 1978. Landlords  must also make the disclosure to new 
tenants and those renewing leases. This in cludes handing the prospective buyer or new 
tenant a copy of the EPA's "Protect Your Fa mily from Lead in Your Home" brochure. And 
some states also require that  general contractors, working in your home, provide you with 
disclosures about the dange rs of lead poisoning.  
EPA guides and information from the Nationa l Lead Information Center cover safety, 
testing, remodeling and disclosure procedures. 
 
Asbestos 
Asbestos was banned in 1997, the mineral fiber asbestos was previously used in a range 
of home building products to provi de heat insulation, to strength en and add fire resistance.  
In older homes, roofing, siding, insulation, acous tical materials and floor  tiles are potential 
sources of asbestos, according to the EPA.  Many states also require disclosures for other 
hazardous materials, such as asbestos.  
 As long as the asbestos material remains intact , it doesn't pose an immense  threat.   But 
if asbestos-laden material is disturbed, it can release microscopic asbestos fibers.  
Excessive or long- term exposure creates ri sks of cancer and lung disease.  Children, 
pregnant women, smokers and others with pulmo nary system problems are particularly at 
risk.  
 You can't tell if a material contains asbestos  simply by looking at it unless it's labeled. 
Hire an accredited laboratory through the National Institute for Standards and Technology 
(NIST) or contact your st ate or local health department for assistance.  Don't just take these 
matters into your own hands. If done improperly, even just taking a sample for lab analysis can be hazardous.  Have professionals who know how to remove the sample safely, and 
provide the solutions.  Asbestos removal is very expensive. The recommended alternative 
is usually covering the material or seali ng it so the asbestos  is not released.  
197  
Do not hesitate to question a contractor or repairman about their qua lifications to deal 
with hazardous materials.  
 
Black Mold 
Black mold -- a colored, fuzzy black mold gr owth -- can be a cause of toxicity.  The 
colonies usually emit a very unpleasant, must y odor. Exposure to black mold spores can 
cause mild to severe allergic reactions, a nd possibly more serious problems, depending on 
individual sensitivity -- and sometimes there are much more serious effects. 
- Do not touch mold or moldy items with your bare hands.  - Do not get mold or mold spores in your eyes.  - Do not breathe in mold or mold spores.  - Consult a professional for Personal Prot ective Equipment (PPE) and containment 
guidelines. PPE should be worn when dist urbing mold. The minimum PPE is an N-95 
respirator, gloves, and eye protection. 
Environmental testing and sampling of a mold-contaminated structure is often 
necessary to determine proper remediation pr ocedures. An environmental professional who 
is trained for this should perf orm mold testing and sampling.   
Preventing mold involves mostly control ling moisture and humidity.  Building 
materials should be kept dry to prevent mol d.  Tips on mold prevention can be found here: 
http://www.toxic-black-mold-info.com/prevent.htm  
The Environmental Protection Agency has released a publication titled "Mold 
Remediation in Schools and Co mmercial Buildings."  It guides buildi ng owners and 
managers through identifying, remediating a nd preventing mold (though it does not discuss 
specific mold exposure limits for hea lth purposes).  It's  available at:

Disasters and Terrorist Attacks 
If disaster strikes or there is a terrorist attack, the Am erican Red Cross recommends 
that you: 
- Remain calm and be patient.  - Follow the advice of local emergency officials.  - Listen to your radio or televi sion for news and instructions.  
- If the disaster occurs near you, check for injuries. Give first aid and get help for 
seriously injured people.  
- If the disaster occurs near your home wh ile you are there, check for damage using a 
flashlight. Do not light matches or candles or turn on electric al switches. Check for fires, 
fire hazards and other household hazards. Sniff for gas leaks, starting at the water heater. If 
you smell gas or suspect a leak, turn off th e main gas valve, open windows, and get 
everyone outside quickly.  
- Shut off any other damaged utilities.  - Confine or secure your pets.  - Call your family contact—do not use the teleph one again unless it is  a life-threatening 
emergency.  
- Check on your neighbors, especially those who are elderl y or disabled.  
To prepare for a terrorist attack the Amer ican Red Cross recommends that you create 
an emergency communications plan, establish a meeting place, assemble a disaster supplies 
kit and check on the school emergency plan  of any school-age children you may have. 
Other recommendations also would apply, su ch as creating a shelter-in-place and 
having adequate and appropriate food and water, among others. 
As we learned from the events of September 11, 2001, the following things can happen 
after a terrorist attack:  
There can be significant numbers of casual ties and/or damage to  buildings and the 
infrastructure. So employers need up-to-date  information about any medical needs you may 
have and on how to contact your  designated beneficiaries.  
Heavy law enforcement involvement at local, state and federal levels  follows a terrorist 
attack due to the event's criminal nature.  
Health and mental health resources in the a ffected communities can be strained to their 
limits, maybe even overwhelmed.  
Extensive media coverage, strong public f ear and international implications and 
consequences can continue for a prolonged period.  
Workplaces and schools may be closed, and th ere may be restrictions on domestic and 
international travel.  
You and your family or household may have  to evacuate an area, avoiding roads 
blocked for your safety.  
Clean-up may take many months.  
199 Evacuation 
If local authorities as k you to leave your home, they ha ve a good reason to make this 
request, and you should heed the advice immediatel y. Listen to your radi o or television and 
follow the instructions of local emergency offi cials and keep these simple tips in mind-  
Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants and sturdy shoes so you can be protected as much 
as possible.  
Take your disaster supplies kit.  Take your pets with you; do not leave them  behind. Because pets are not permitted in 
public shelters, follow your plan to go to a relative's or friend's home, or find a "pet-
friendly" hotel.  
Lock your home.  Use travel routes specified by local aut horities—don't use shortc uts because certain 
areas may be impassable or dangerous.  
Stay away from downed power lines.  Listen to local authorities.  Your local authorities will pr ovide you with the most accurate information specific to 
an event in your area. Staying tuned to lo cal radio and television, and following their 
instructions is your  safest choice.  
If you're sure you have time:  Call your family contact to  tell them where you are going and when you expect to 
arrive.  
Shut off water and electricity before leaving, if instructed to do so. Leave natural gas 
service ON unless local official s advise you otherwise. You may need gas for heating and 
cooking, and only a professional can restore gas se rvice in your home once it's been turned 
off. In a disaster situation it could ta ke weeks for a profe ssional to respond.

High Voltage Power Lines, Microwave Radiation 
Like other issues where there are millions of dollars at stake, there is great controversy 
over the effects of ambient radiation, such as  living near high voltage power lines and 
being around the kind of the radiation genera ted by microwave ovens and other devices.   
Personally, I wouldn't live next to high volta ge power lines or a cell phone tower, and I 
will stay several yards away from a microw ave oven when it's operating, and well out of 
the range of radar.  Also, I use a cell phone  hands free with an extension earpiece and 
microphone which keeps the antenna away from the head.  Cordless phones like those used 
in the home have a much lower power than  mobile phones, because their range is 200 
meters maximum, while the range of mobile phones is several kilometers.

Urban Living 
City Living Increases Male Mortality Risk by 125 Percent according to a new 
nationwide survey of 3,617 adults by the Un iversity of Michigan published in the 
December 2000 issue of the American Journal of Public Health. “The excess mortality risk 
among men residing in cities riva ls that of cigarette smoking, social isolation, low income 
and other major psychosocial risk factors for mortality,” says study lead author James S. 
House.  Dr. House is director of the survey center at the University of Michigan Institute 
for Social Research in Ann Arbor. 
They found that living in a c ity carried an excess hazard of mortality only for men 
under the age of 65, and particul arly for white men. Black men had an equal likelihood of 
dying living in the city or a subur b.  While researchers saw the in creased risk of death in all 
types and sizes of cities, they found that urba n men were more likely to have died from 
infections and tumors.   “Eleva ted levels of tumor deaths su ggest the influence of physical, 
chemical and biological exposures  in urban areas, “ Dr. House says. “Living in  cities also 
involves potentially stressful levels of  noise, sensory stimulation and overload, 
interpersonal relations and conf lict, and vigilance against ha zards ranging from crime to 
accidents.”  The stresses of urban life ma y exacerbate immune suppression in men. 
"Women don’t seem to carry the same risk  because they might have some social, 
psychological or biological resources that buffe r or protect them from the hazard of city 
life.  And the majority of blacks who live in the suburbs are not better or worse off 
201 socioeconomically than those who live in near by cities, and their death risk was equal in 
both places.  Living in cities al so involves potentially stressf ul levels of noise, sensory 
stimulation and overload, interpersonal relations  and conflict, and vigilance against hazards 
ranging from crime to accidents,” House says. 
Still, because two characteristics are found together doesn't mean that one causes the 
other.  Is the city risky in itself or if certain types of pe ople choose to live in the city. 
Charles Longino, professor of sociology at Wa ke Forest University, in Winston-Salem, 
N.C., commenting on the study.   “They contai n higher proportions of people with high 
stress levels, frustrated ambitions and fewer personal resources,” he adds. “How many of 
these factors would change if they moved to  rural areas? It may not be location but the 
people in those locations that is key to understand these findings.” 
 
International Travel 
Here's a web site to advise you of risks of in ternational travel, such  as the incidence of 
the major diseases that may arise from in ternational travel, hazards related to the 
environment, like bathing, altitude, heat and hum idity, sun, insects, a nd accidents, and risks 
from food and drink:  http://www.who.int/ith/english/risks.htm  
 
Ergonomics 
We were designed for movement. Standing is our most natural postu re.  Sitting for long 
periods of time strains the spine, muscles,  tendons and ligaments.  The help alleviate 
pressure on the vertebrae, it is critical to s upport the lower back.  This is accomplished by 
the bottom of the chair with a lumbar (lower back) support that is "outdented" or formed 
with a fairly broad area so as to press somewh at into the spine just above the pelvis and 
support it. A separate back support or a small pillow can do much the same thing.   
Repetitive strain (not to be confused with  carpel tunnel syndrome) happens as a result 
of a maladaptive body position.  It creates long-term stress, pulling muscles and nerves in 
directions that are not usua l for the body parts involved.  It can even be permanently 
disabling.  Symptoms include numbness of th e fingers, tingling, coldness and discomfort 
and the hands, burning of the fingers and pain  at night.  Lower and upper back, and other 
body parts can be affected. 
Sit up straight with your head  above the shoulders.  Don't bend forward (which often 
accompanies working on a computer) as this  decreases lung capacity, reduces oxygenation, 
causes fatigue, and results in a permanent "turtleneck".    
The front edge of your chair should not press behind your knees -- you should be able 
to the your fist between the end of the seat and back of your knee.   
Thighs should be at a 90 degree angle from  your body, and ideally the feet will be flat 
on an elevated and angled foot rest.  You'll need  a quality chair that f its you properly.  And 
ideally it will adjust up and down, the seat wi ll tilt forward and back, the chair's back tilt 
will be adjustable, it will have armrests, a nd the chairs seat will fit your seat.    
If you work on a computer, then focus your ey es away from your computer or from 
your work at least every 15 minut es. Documents should be at ey e-level, and the top of the 
monitor should be 0 to 15 degrees below eye level. Forearms should be supported on a soft armrest -- slightly above the position where th ey hang relaxed from your shoulders.  The  
armrest of your chair his fine, but you may ev en want to go as far as using a forearm 
support.  I use the "Ergo Rest" attachment from Sweden.  Wrists should be straight plus or 
minus 10 degrees.   
202 Get up and walk around at least once in hour.  Stretch in all directi ons, and lean over to 
gently try to touch your toes wh ile letting your head dangle.  Co me back up slowly so as to 
not cause muscles to spasm. Shrug your shoul ders up & down and forward & back and in 
big circles.  Move your head from side to si de and front & back ar ound in big circles about 
10 times each.  Clench your hands in a fist and move them with 10 circles and then 10 
circles out.   Put your hands together in a praying position and squeeze together for a few 
seconds, then put the backs of your hands toge ther for a few seconds.  Spread your fingers 
apart and bring the back together.  Bring your  palms up and down in a big wave.  Turn 
palms up, then turn palms down.  Just move your head, shoulders and hands every which 
way.  Set a timer for these to help you remember.   
To reduce repetitive motion stra in on the hands I use a voice recognition system.  I talk 
and it types into my word processor.  I first tried one system and lo st almost 1/2 day of 
work with it as well as experienced an awful lot of frustration.  Tw ice it took over in hour 
to train it to recognize my voice, and when it wa s time to save the spee ch files, the system 
stalled and I lost my work.  When I called th eir technical support pe ople I was told that 
there was a problem with a couple of "DLLs" (software components), and that they were 
aware of this and had heard of it before.  I br ought this up to the company's representatives 
at a trade show and they acted dumb. I took the system back and got the Dragon 
NaturallySpeaking System and it has performe d generally acceptably.  Although I do have 
to frequently touch up my work, it has saved an awful lot of typing and st rain to the hands.

Making Your Home Safer 
Robbers, burglars, bandits, rapists and othe r intruders who would break into your home 
to do you harm really don't like lig hts - either interior and exteri or. Security lights with heat 
or motion sensors that turn on when someone  passes are highly advised, and they are 
relatively inexpensive. 
If you are away, use a light timer that goes on and off at various intervals to give the 
appearance that someone is home. Exterior li ghting are critical ar eas like common parking 
lots or underground garages if you need to walk  to your front door.   You want to see who 
is around you, and avoid any potential threats.  Because criminals don't want to be seen or 
identified it is also a deterrent. 
You will also want to keep the outside  of your home or apartment well lighted, 
especially the entryway.  Light s should be on a timer or photo-cell so they come on at dusk 
and off at dawn -- lights left on all day is a gi veaway that you are away from home for an 
extended time.  
Decals that indicates an alarm system, a dog, or block watch or operation identification 
can be good deterrents.   
While sophisticated alarm systems can be effective, so is a very yappy dog.  Walk around your home and evaluate it as thoug h you were a burglar.  Try to break in.  
Correct any access points right away.  Alt hough no home is completely safe from a 
determined and experienced burglar, if you ma ke it difficult and less likely for someone to 
break in to your home. 
By far, the most common threat to a home is  burglary.  Most occur during the daytime 
when people are away, but they also occur at night when it looks like nobody is home. 
Robbers and burglars often use ordinary househ old tools like screwdri vers, channel-lock 
pliers, pry bars, and hammers to get in.  They usually involve a selec tion process, which is 
203 simple -- a home with the easiest access, the greatest amount of cover and with the easiest 
escape are their first choices.   
The garage door is usually the weakest entry,  and then it's by the back door. Use high 
quality Grade-1 or 2 locks on ex terior doors to resist twisti ng, prying and lock-picking.  A 
quality deadbolt lock will have a beveled casi ng to inhibit the use of channel-lock pliers 
used in forced entry.   A quality door knob-in-l ock set will have a 'dead latch' mechanism 
to prevent slipping the lock with a shim or credit card. 
The most common forced entry method through a door with a wooden frame is to kick 
it open.  The weakest point is usua lly the "strike plate" that ho lds the latch or lock bolt in 
place.  The average door strike plate is secure d with only two half-inch screws in the door 
frame molding.  These moldings are often light weight and tacked on to the door frame, and 
can be broken with a hard kick.   Upgrade to  a four-screw, heavy-duty, high security strike 
plate available in many hardware stores.  Install it with 3-inch wood scre ws to cut deep into 
the door frame stud.  Use these longer screws in the knob lock strike plate as well and use 
at least one long screw in each door hinge.  Th is one alone will deter or prevent most 
through-the-door forced entries.   A wide-angle peephole is advised. 
Windows, particularly first floor windows, are often left unlocked a nd are the targets of 
intruders.  Some upper windows can be accessed by trees, balconies etc.  They should be 
secured to prevent sliding open from the outside.  Thick stic ks (like a broomstick) should 
secure them so they cannot be opened more th an six inches.  Through-the-frame pins work 
well for vertical sliding windows. Be sure you can't reach in from the outside and remove 
the blocking device.  But -- make sure they can  be removed quickly in case of fire.  Other 
blocking devices are availabl e at hardware stores.   
Arrange your furniture and furnishings such as lamps so as to obstruct windows.  If 
they knock something over when coming in chances are good you will hear it, and they may even flee.  If you awake and find an intr uder in the same ro om, acting as though you 
are still asleep can be a good tactic until you can either fl ee, or fight if necessary. 
Don't hide keys in obvious places outside your home -- intruders know to look for 
them.   
Sliding glass doors are usually installed at th e rear of a home or apartment which often 
makes them the choice for entry.  Intruders know that sliding gla ss doors are often left 
open.  Since they slide horizontally, it is important to have a blocking device in place to prevent sliding the door fully open from the out side.   This can be easily accomplished by 
inserting a thick wooden stick (l ike a broomstick) into the tr ack to prevent opening.  Other 
blocking devices available include metal fold- down blocking devices called "charley bars" 
and various track-blockers that can be scre wed down.  The inexpensive metal becomes 
worn, or out of adjustment, and the sliding door can often be lifted out of it's track. Keep 
the door rollers in good condition and properly adjusted to pr event this.  You can also 
install anti-lift devices  such as a pin that extends thr ough both the sliding and fixed portion 
of the door.  Many hardware stores carry lock ing and blocking devices to prevent a sliding 
door from being lifted or  forced horizontally.   
Get to know your neighbors and watch out  for each others homes. If you go on 
vacation, have your neighbors pick up your mail, newspapers, etc., and chick the outside and inside to make sure all is  well.   Perhaps they could o ccasionally park in your driveway 
to give the appearance of occupancy while you are on vacation. 
 
Home Security Systems 
204 
   Alarm systems range in sophistication and price -- everything from  do-it-yourself kits 
that set off a siren or lights to professiona lly installed systems that hook directly to the 
police station or a monitoring se rvice.  Sensors detect an in truder and send a signal to a 
control unit, which in turn sets off an alarm. 
   Considerations include burgl ary protection, fire safet y, carbon monoxide poisoning 
prevention and child and senior safety. 
   Security systems should include alarms th at are installed in your  house as well as a 24-
hour home monitoring system that will detect trouble even when you're away. 
   Have a system that is monitored for burgl ary, as well as fire and medical emergencies. 
   An ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cu re.  Prevent burglary --  ensure your security 
system has a loud alarm, detectors at all ex terior doors and motion detectors throughout the 
house. 
   Get one with a monitored panic buttons th at you can push for help when an emergency 
arises are a great way to ensure assistance will arri ve as soon as possible. 
   An array of high-tech devi ces are available, such as surveillance cameras, and driveway 
and perimeter sensors that detect motion a nd transmit the alert back to the house.

How About Some of Those People 
I live in a beach area which in the summe r has an unending supply of erratically and 
unpredictably darting modes of tr ansportation -- razor scooters,  skateboards, rollerblades, 
bi/tri/unicycles, mopeds, sports cars and pogo sticks -- many propelled by beach-crazed 
young 'uns.  I have learned to be especially careful when drivi ng my car as they can at any 
time burst out into the street directly in front of my car from all over the place. 
Just last week I had an inte resting little incident to learn from. I approached an 
intersection as a fairly  large guy was pulling up, being briskly towed by just the cutest pit 
bull.  He looked awfully upset, even before  I went in front of him, missing him by many 
yards, but causing him to slow down some.  I soon heard "Watch where you're going!" followed by not a four letter word, the (gasp) seven letter "a" word (it refers to a part of the 
anatomy that we would hard to live without, but we would probably rather be something 
like a brain, or an eye, or even a spleen).  Realizing my error and not having any particular 
personal sensitivity to another guy who is behavi orally challenged, I just said "Sorry about 
that" as he pedaled on.  I kind of nodded and he kind of nodded, and I was a little relieved 
that no more 4, 7 or 12 letter words spewed forth.   
In situations like this it proba bly would be better to just drive on.  But I kind of got to 
thinking "Hmmm, this wasn't all my fault."   And if he continues, he could get himself and 
that cute little pit bull run over!  Ever willing to service to my fellow man, I said in a fairly loud but not antagonistic tone "Hey, ya know you were on the wr ong side of the street and 
going kind of fast." as he's pedaling into the in tersection (luckily for him, he waited for the 
"walk" light).  I then got invited to meet him on the other side to "dis cuss" it.  I just said 
"That's all I have to say."  He must have rea lly needed to talk to someone because at about 
1/2 way through the intersection I heard, again "Well meet me on the other side and we'll 
'discuss' it."   
Anyway, my 20/20 hindsight tell s me that I managed this just about right, for once.  
Could have hit the gas and made  a run for the border at any time.  But next time maybe I'll 
just yell "OK I'm sorry! But youuuuuu were on th e wrong side of the street and going 
205 wayyyyyy too fast!  And you're a big pottymouth!!  See ya, butthead. Grow up!"  If I am, 
say, challenged to a duel, without  hesitation I will reply: "I A CCEPT!  But it's my choice of 
weapons.  COW PIES AT TEN PA CES!" And if I get chased I' ll just hit the gas and drive 
in the opposite direction, and see how fast he can pedal after me. 
OKOK, only kidding.  So what was the last pa ragraph really about?  It was about an 
ego (mine, actually) trying to make itself feel  better and not under the control of another 
ego. And maybe a little more important.  But by falling into an anger trap, we really are 
being controlled by someone else.   
We aspire to a level of living that is beyond what most people will settle for.  And such 
ego-driven habits are without meaning and ju st not worthy of our energy and time.  You 
are above such trivial co ncerns.  Your consciousness is highe r.  It's not because we're better 
than anyone else.  We wish all people well.  We have just been fortunate enough to have 
come to position in life where we recognize so me the insignificant, and just won't get 
pulled into piddly contests. 
So do not rattle a hornets nest, play with fi re, tease alligators, prod a llama (they may 
not have much of an armory when it comes to  claws or fangs, but the sure can spit) or 
antagonize someone with an attitude.  The best way to handle it is probably just to kind of 
apologize or just say nothing and move on, a nd resolve to continue  your very safe and 
defensive driving habits, or whatever, in the future. 
Situations and people seem to  come into our lives for a reason, usually for training.  
This situation involves an ego trying to make itself feel bette r (or less bad), and my better 
learning how to handle it.  And remember it's on ly practice.   And you' ll cause harm to your 
own self just by getting emoti onally all worked up, as well as  impede the solution.  Follow 
you're intuition, and let's just stay away from  dangerous situations and dangerous people.  
 
Stayin' Alive -- If You Are Absolutely, Positi vely, 100% For Sure Your Life Is In Danger 
and Must Defend Yourself 
I felt a gnawing feeling in my tummy as I wr ote the next part.  I hesitated for a long 
time after and wanted to cut it out because it's not pretty.  But after pl enty of consideration 
about today's climate and some of the peopl e on the streets today, for your ongoing health 
and ability to remain here on th e planet, I had to put this in. 
Again, dangerous situations and dangerous people are to be avoided.  If you are 
walking on the side walk and you sense trouble  heading toward you, cross the street and 
avoid it. Pay attention to your initial gut feelings about a potentially dangerous person or 
situation. Don't give an acquainta nce a lift in your car  if your senses go on alert.  And rude 
and ambiguous comments from a thug can be li ke quicksand -- don't respond in anger to let 
yourself get pulled in.  
Unless you are one, you would be at a dist inct disadvantage when up against an 
experienced street fighter or  a drugged-up thug on his (or her) own terrain.  And with 
legalities as they are, particularly regardi ng assault with weapons, we  should consider that 
a prison term resulting from hastily enteri ng a brawl would put you living with the people 
you would want to avoid. 
Often aggressors will attempt to size up thei r victims before starting a confrontation.  
Their motives may not be violence pre se, but ra ther to evaluate whether the victim will be 
a target for theft, or rape.   
206 Body language, or how you maintain your body pos ture, can do much to divert this.  
For example, appearing to lack confidence with slumped shoulders and looking at the 
ground can send a signal that you are a potential victim. 
Most violent confrontations begin with so me form of verbal exchange.  A timid, 
apologetic appearance, along with body language  that shows a lack of confidence, can 
encourage an aggressor.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, a highly reactive and overly-
aggressive response can result in  the escalation of a situation th at could have been avoided.  
An approach that takes the middle ground is to be assertive (but not aggressive), look the 
aggressor in the eye, hold the hands up with the palms to ward the aggressor (this non-
verbally says "stay back" -- but also puts you in a position to bl ock if he should attack), and 
strongly say "Back off" or  "Keep your distance". 
Sometimes aggressive people will “set you up” by creating a situ ation where you cause 
some minor offense, then goad you into a conf rontation with some righteous indignation.  
Hopefully just saying “I’m sorry.  That was not my intention.” (loudly so any witnesses 
will hear), then walking away.  But glance ove r your shoulder from time to time to make 
sure you’re not being followed – and either stay in a public place until you’re sure they 
have left, or get out of there fast. 
Don't kid yourself into believing that after a few weeks or even years of karate school 
type martial arts lessons, or even "tae bo", that your body will be a deadly weapon. You 
need the appropriate mind-set and some pr actical experience.  Many karate school 
instructors haven't been in many fights and don't really know how to instruct others in the 
dirty art of survival.  
The body releases a tremendous surge of adre naline in a physical confrontation.  The 
result is that you will be thinki ng less clearly, and you will not be  able to execute fancy self 
defense moves you may have done very well in  a practice situation. This happens even 
with experienced street fighters.  The soluti on is to use only simple, and highly effective 
moves that you have practiced. 
Real life boxing is one way for you to develop real life fighting skills.  Of course, the 
downside is that punches to the head are ve ry damaging, so you are intentionally causing 
the kind of damage you are training to avoid yourself and on others.  So I would avoid 
actual head contact.  
I have watched the "Ultimate Fighting Championship" on cable TV.  Very 
enlightening.  You can check these out on vide o sometime.  I was really surprised at the 
number of punches these guys would eat withou t being slowed down.  But they've been at 
this a long time and have been in a lot of fi ghts. Even though I had a few years martial arts 
training in my younger days and thought I knew just a little something, what I found most 
impressive was the use of "submi ssion" holds of the kind used in  jiu-jitsu.  This is where a 
combatant gets his opponent in an arm lock, le g lock, choke hold or similar hold and puts 
on the pressure.  Usually the opponent will "tap  out", or give up, rather than experience 
intense pain and then have the twisted limb broken.  In one match the Brazilian master, 
Royce Gracie, was being held upside down agai nst the 6" chain link fence.  Mr. Gracie 
somehow got a hold on a wrist or  an arm or a leg (or maybe something more personal, I 
really couldn't tell in the fray), and must have done something very painful because his 
opponent immediately submitted.   
There are a number of ways of d ealing with dangerous people.   
- It is often heard that  you must immediately "stand up" to a bully -- never give an inch.  
Personally I don't thing this is usually the best  way to handle it, and that it's your "manly 
207 manliness" (or womanly womanliness) -- i.e.  ego -- taking over.  You can often avoid 
confrontation if handled properly. 
- Another method is to immedi ately stun the bully with a swift, powerful blow, then 
shout ("Fire! Fire!" is often suggested), th en run like crazy before your attacker knows 
what hit him. 
And for women (or men) -- if you are be ing coerced to go somewhere else, that 
place is seldom safer for you th an the place you are now at.   
Whatever you do to handle what you belie ve is a physical situation with an 
attacker, just be sure it's really a dangerous  situation and not just your imagination 
playing tricks on you. 
What follows are some methods that almost a nyone could do with very little training or 
practice.  Many of these will result in perman ent, irreversible, lifelong (that means for the 
rest of their life) inju ries to your opponent.  That's anot her reason why we wouldn't want to 
fight.  But this is reserved for a point wher e it's them or you.  And after all, you have done 
your very best to just stay away from danger ous situations and people.  You have loudly 
said "Leave me alone!  Go away!" -- preferab ly in the presence of w itnesses who will come 
forward to testify that you did ever ything you could to avoid confrontation 
- The aggressor "only" intends to push or hold on to the victim in an attempt to 
intimidate or coerce, but serious or deadly acti on is not intended -- so the victim uses some 
method to break the hold, and possibly deliver a punch or kick that will stun the aggressor 
in order to get them to leave you alone.  But how do you know the aggressor's actual 
intent?  How do you know just how much force to apply in order to "neu tralize the threat"? 
- Here's how another option, and it's basically  an "all or nothing" strategy.  If in a 
situation where: 
THE VICTIM (YOU) HAS AP OLOGIZED, NEGOTIATED,  
IF DONE SOMETHONG WRONG TR IED TO MAKE IT RIGHT,  
GIVEN UP THE MONEY, ASKED TO BE LEFT ALONE, AND  
RUN AWAY ONLY TO BE CAUGHT,  
AND OTHERWISE EXHAUSTED ALL MEANS OF PEACEFUL 
RESOLUTION AND IS  
* ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, 100% SURE HE OR SHE MUST DEFEND 
HIM/HERSELF *  
* OR ELSE DEATH OR RISK SERIOUS INJURY TO SELF OR LOVED ONES * 
 
Then the best defense can be a strong offens e that is explosive and fierce -- "neutralize 
the threat" then get out of there to safety.  It is best launched qui ckly so as to take 
advantage of the element of surprise.  And your  assailant should be very surprised, as you 
were just requesting him to just leave you al one before he caught up with you and started 
trying to punch, kick, choke you or whatever. 
Now the most important part: your mental attitude.  You ar e transformed from a loving 
being of light into someone with immense re solve.  You will survive. You now have an 
intense will to do whatever it takes to protect yourself and your family and to live another day with love.   
Unleash hell.  Take the boxer's fighting stance,  stare with hatred into the eyes of this 
thing you must overcome and escape from.  If you have another chance, shout "Leave me 
208 alone!  Go away. Let me go.  I know how to fight and I can hurt you!"  But don't use this as 
a reason for unnecessary delay.  Thugs prey on the weak.  Hopefully he will recognize the 
dangerous person you are and leave, or allow you to go in peace.   
There are usually a number of objects, or  "invisible weapons " available, like: 
A table lamp, book, or ju st about any object. 
A key or pen -- best with the object butted against the palm and extending out in the 
direction of the fingers 
Throw your cup of hot coffee in his face A belt wrapped around your fist with  the buckle hanging about 3"  
A padlock -- either swung with the curved lock ing part that lifts up held in your middle 
finger and the body outside, or with the body of the lock held in your fist and punching 
with the curved part ou tside of your middle finger 
Just about any heavy object, either  held in the hand or thrown 
A coat hanger or a narro w stick will make a big thwack  and cause sharp pain and 
damage when swiftly and forcefully  applied to an assailant's face 
Hair spray into the eyes A small keychain exacto type knife with about a 3/8" blade of the kind sold in 
supermarkets can cause severe lengthy cuts  and bleeding.  If you are bent over and 
taking a thrashing you can even rip quite a fe w long slashed in your assailant's leg and 
cause him to bleed a whole lot. 
 
A few quick and dirty a lternatives and moves: 
Use your brain.  If you are about to be att acked tell the thug that you have AIDS and 
have nothing to lose, and threaten to spit on hi m if he comes close -- or bite him if he 
starts a fight. 
Pepper spray, if legal in your area 
Stun guns, if legal in your area 
Kick to the kneecap.  Standing in your figh ting stance, first lift your forward leg, then 
thrust your foot sideward and downward onto your attacker's kneecap. Or first punch or 
fake high, then quickly deliver one or more kicks to the kneecap. Then you will be able 
to run faster than he'll be able to hobble on a broken knee.  Kicks must be delivered fast 
and with a snap, quickly returni ng back to a balanced stance 
Eye gouge -- hold fingers apart and stiff, a nd thrust.  Or thumb over top of fist and 
thrust 
Bite -- bridge of the nos e and fingers are good targets 
Punch, palm heel, kick or area above knee to  a vulnerable area -- throat, solar plexus, 
groin 
Head butt -- best delivered to th e nose.  Put your back into it. 
Grasp an ear firmly and rip it off Hold of to his forward arm with one hand a nd repeatedly punch with your other fist. 
Pull a couple of fingers apart sideways  or one back over the top of the hand 
209 Drop to the ground and while keep ing your legs toward the a ttacker, kick to the knees, 
legs, groin, and other target s that present themselves. 
 When striking, strike through the head or body -- as if you're punchi ng the back of the 
head (the face is just  getting in the way). 
An attacker will often drop their shoulder  before doing a "sucker punch" (punching you 
without warning) and "t elegraph" their punch.   
Knees are easy to shatter or di slocate, so if you're going to use them as weapons, strike 
with the fleshy area just above the knee.  And they make gr eat targets.  But elbows and 
upper forearms can deliver a lot of force, especial ly when in close with an assailant.  Keep 
your hand close to the body when  striking with an elbow.   
If you are a woman and find yourself in a situ ation with a rapist or where you are about 
to get beat up, attempt to run and escape at the first, or any opportunity.  If you are being 
taken somewhere, that place is seldom more  safe than the initial place where you were 
about to be abducted.  The initial spot is as good as it gets.  Don't hesitate to run.  React 
immediately.  If you can't run, then fight.  Victims say that even mild resistance like 
screaming and striking back helped them focus and become the aggressor. Tap your 
primitive rage.   If you're abducted in your car, tr y to crash it, or if you're in an abductor's 
car try to get him to crash it. 
If your lapels are grabbed w ith both hands or you are choked, you can stun the attacker 
with a punch or slap, then bend your knees while clasping both hands and drive upward 
between the attacker's forearms to cause him to release.  Alternatively (although this takes 
some training) you can grab both of the attack er's hands just behind and over the thumb 
and bring them to the outside and downward in  two wide circles.  Bringing them further 
downward will bring him to his knees (or have  wrists broken), allowing you to then bring 
your knee upward and strike with the fles hy part just above the knee, or punch. 
If your wrist is grabbed, a good release is to  pull through the thumb -- the weakest part 
of the hold). 
If you are grabbed from behind, stomp the top of the foot, elbow the solar plexus or 
throat, or make a backward  strike to the groin. 
Regarding using a boxing type defense: Ma ny police departments recommend a strike 
with the palm of an open hand rather than a fist. Be careful not to jam your fingers 
backward.  A fist should be made  with fingers curled tight, with  top part of fingers pretty 
much in a straight line and thumb over the index finger and part of the middle finger.  
Forearm and top of fist are in a straight lin e, and punches should be with the knuckles of 
the index and middle fingers. Maintain your ba lance, with feet di rectly under your body 
about shoulder width apart with preferred le g forward.  In boxing a "southpaw" stance 
(with the right hand forward) is generally co nsidered somewhat confusing to an opponent 
and can be more difficult to defend against because it is backwards. Hands are up, with 
forward fist protecting your  jaw and elbows somewhat downward to protect your body.  
Carry your head slightly forward and downwar d, chin slightly tucked behind your forward 
shoulder. Don't fall into holding the head way back thinking this will better avoid punches 
as it will throw you off balance.  Most punches are best thrown in a straight line, not in 
"haymaker" fashion, although a hook (a roundabo ut punch, striking with  the knuckles) and 
a backfist (a snappy punch where the fist stays pretty much in an upright position) are effective.   
210 Stay loose and don't hold your breath.  Musc le tension will slow  you and burn energy, 
and make you less effective.  Look for ope nings and punch.  When punching, shift your 
body and bodyweight behind it in an explosive m ovement. Shift your shoulder and hip.  
You are actually anchoring your power through your body and to the ground.  Don't just 
punch at your target, punch through it.  Return to the initial position quickly.  Don't drop 
your hand after a punch.   Move fluidly and maintain your balance, don't dance. 
Choose targets like the nose, eyes, point of the chin, hinge  of the jaw, throat, solar 
plexus, crotch, kidneys or temples.  Avoid th e forehead and teeth, as teeth will cut your 
hand and you don't know what kind of disease this guy is carrying. If you sense you have 
hurt your attacker, punch to the same spot two or three more times if at all possible. 
Jiu-jitsu (or Brazilian jiu-ji tsu) style take-downs, arm locks and leg locks are very 
effective.  These are best learned by personal instruction, and instruct ional videos are also 
available.   
This is just an overview.  It is best le arned in person from so meone with a lot of 
experience, not from a couple of paragraphs out  of a book.  Still, by pr acticing this you are 
likely to get the feel for it and be better prepared should you absolutely have to use it 
someday.  You could practice throwing punches a nd kicks a part of your aerobic routine. 
Rehearse and visualize the attacker in front  of you and what you will do when practicing. 
You want to stun your attacker and escape.  Size does matter, and trying to punch 
it out with someone bigger than you can lead to disaster 
Only continue until you can get yoursel f or your loved ones out of there  
quickly and safely. 
 
And don't hurt yourself or anyone else when practicing these. 
 
A bigger opponent definitely has an advantag e over a smaller one, that's why boxers are 
divided into wei ght divisions.   
After following this system  you will be in good condition.  But the physical strength 
and power from your weight training is your si ngle best asset. Today more criminals are 
aware that much stiffer penalties come with  weapons assaults, so they will often just 
commit the crime unarmed.  Rehearse and visualize what you will do when you practice these. 
Defense against a knife attack is best kept at a distance with kicks to the knees.  If you 
can get past a knife or a club th e above defenses could work.   
 
Firearms 
Let the police handle breakins if at all possible.  If you are in your own home, that 
allows a greater possibility and legality for the use of firearms.  If you keep a firearm in 
your own home: 
Learn how to use it ef fectively and SAFELY! 
Take a class or private lessons and go to the target range and practice with it 
And 
KEEP IT LOCKED AND OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN! 
211 With all the violence they see on TV and in the movies, children are very curious 
about guns.  If given a moment's opportunity  they'll find a way to "play" with it, and 
you can expect disaster. 
 
TV and movies have given some false ideas about gunfights.  Most  are over within a 
couple of seconds and with just a few shots fi red. Greater speed is preferred to pinpoint 
accuracy.  In a crisis, it's easy to miss easy shots.   It has been advised that if you must fire 
your weapon, shoot to kill, and that trying to just  "wing 'em" will spell disaster.  But it has 
also been said that it all happens so quickl y and there is no time for careful aiming, so 
shoot to hit. And someone who ge ts shot doesn't just fall over in stantly like in the movies.   
You know the terrain of your home which gi ves you a certain advantage over someone 
who doesn't.  Usually try to remain behind cove r (protected against bu llets), or at least 
concealed (hidden as much as possible, but not pr otected from bullets), an d in the dark if at 
night.  When looking around a corner or around a piece of furniture, get as low as possible 
or in a crouching position and m ove just the tip of the gun and as small an area of your 
head and hands around it as possible in order to  take aim or look, making as small a target 
as possible and in a lower pos ition that's unexpected.   
Think, be cautious, but act quickly.  Fire in bursts of two or three rounds, and don't stay 
in the same position unless you have good cover.  There is a thing called "dead man's five 
seconds", where the one who has been shot  has that amount of time before becoming 
unconscious or dying. 
A small caliber weapon like a .22 is of lesser value compared to a weapon that packs 
some firepower.  Many an angr y or drugged-up thug will just ta ke the small bullet and keep 
on coming.  But -- the greater the firepower, the more skill is needed to control it.  And 
there is a saying: "I'd rather be missed by a .45 than hit by a .22."   
There is great debate over the reliability of revolver vs. automatic in terms of reliability 
and speed.  Also debate over a high speed bulle t that fragments vs. a heavier cartridge.  
Each has different effects on soft tissue, bone  and organs.  Much of this is based on 
research and is a numbers game.  You must first hit your opponent to cause damage.    
Using two hands to control the gun is pref erred, but since it can happen fast you may 
not have time, and may have to "shoot from th e hip", or with one hand very quickly after 
your gun is drawn.  If there is time, shoo ting from a crouching position will make you a 
smaller target. 
You will want ammunition that is accurate in  the range of the place that you want to 
defend. Also, reliability (no misf ires) is preferred.  This one is pretty far out -- poisoned 
bullets.  And I'm not too sure of the legality of this and you want to stay in compliance of 
the law.  A pellet made of potassium or s odium cyanide from a photographic supply house, 
or nicotine sulfate from a garden or exterminat or shop is placed in the hollow point.  While 
this sounds strange and it woul d take a while to have an effect on your opponent, it could 
make a difference if the two of you wind up sc rambling for cover, and prevent him from 
harming your family afterwards if  you are out of the picture. 
Your best choice for home protection is us ually a shotgun, preferably with a short 
barrel.  The pellets disperse so that even if your aim isn't all that good, or you're scared 
doodyless, you still stand a grea t chance of hitting your mark.  In the middle of the night 
many an intruder will back right out of th e window he was just crawling through after 
hearing the resounding shak shoink'  sound of a 12-gauge shotgun being cocked.  They 
know it means business and can ma ke large holes in them.  
212 You are likely to react as you ha ve practiced or been trained.  It is best to practice 
things like removing the lock and taking the safety off -- but be extremely  careful if this 
is being done with a loaded weapon.  In  fact, always assume your gun is loaded.   
"There is nothing more dangerous than an unloaded gun."  In a real gunfight, with real 
bullets whizzing around you, it is possible that you will vomit or even defecate in your 
pants.  It is not uncommon in combat.  Y ou will need to keep your mind on your shooting.  
Be mentally prepared to kill. Try not to panic, as your opponent  is probably as frightened 
as you are.  Understand that you will be f earful and that your heartrate will speed up. 
Practice under different conditi ons -- like low light or from awkward positions, or after 
running hard. Practice will build  confidence for the day or night you hope never comes. 
And be aware of the positions of other o ccupants in your house or your neighbors, as 
you don't want to hit them. And t oo powerful a cartridge can pene trate walls and hit others.  
Situations are different, but it's usually best to fire upward, thereby the shot clears above 
the heads of your family or others in other rooms of the house. 
 
Closing This Subject 
Regardless of the kind or location of the confrontation, when it's over the hero or 
heroine don't just ride off into the sunset like in a B movie.  The police are likely to want to 
ask you some questions.  You may have to prov e your case in a court of law, and hopefully 
witnesses will come forward to testify that you did everythi ng you could to avoid 
confrontation.  This guy may have fellow gang members or equally vicious relatives, so do 
what you need to do to stay safe later.  Y ou may be very upset.  Don't hesitate to get 
psychological help and perhaps temporary medica tion if you need it, or get involved in a 
victims' support group.  A Course  in Miracles would help you. 
Well, enough of this.  We endeavor to be filled with love and compassion.  I felt this 
was necessary to provide you with the most comprehensive information on living longer.  
And I've never used any of this part -- avoi ded trouble, never had too.  Actually, I'm a big 
wuss.  "Make love not war".  Now let's talk  about something of beauty -- you (and little 
kitty cats). 
213 Beauty and Cats 
My kitty friend, Catie Greystroke 
(she's grey and likes to be stroked),  was 
gazing enviously at the cover of a recent issue of Cosmopolitan  featuring Catherine 
Zeta-Jones. Katie proudly proclaimed that from that moment on she is to be known as Catherine Zeta-Greystroke.  And she 
wants a boob job.  Where will this 
perpetual body fixation in the younger 
generation cats end, I ask you?    
Catie is a charmer, and she's 
about to make the formal 
announcement of a career change from housecat to a supermodel and actress cat.  
Catherine idolizes Jim Carrey for 
all his facial contortions.  She has developed a character she calls "FrankenPuss".  It's based on a combination of the cult classic "Frankenweenie" and Pamela Anderson Lee's character in the movie Barbed Wire  (which was based on the 
movie Casablanca ).   It's alive! 
Just kidding, animals don't 
really talk to me.  Not in words anyway.   
Ach!  And just as Catherine 
Zeta-Jones began to appear just a little pregnant, guess who else does?  Yep, Catherine Zeta-Greystroke!  Note: All kittens now have good homes, and it's assured that Catherine won't be heeding the call of the wild, breaking out and making more kits. 
  
 
Your Better Appearance 
My friend Maureen, an effervescent and hi gh-energy drug counselor asked for some 
info on appearance and beauty.  Sure, if we'r e going to feel younger, we might as well look 
younger. And obviously, the well-toned physique, nice skin and great posture look better 
than flab, skin that hasn't been nourished and an old bowed carriage.  This system will help 
keep your skin (the most noticeable physical part of you) healthy a nd reduce the effects

oxidation of fat and loss of elastic tissue in th e underlying supporting structure of the skin.   
Adequate water intake will help plump your sk in and remove toxins, reduce wrinkles and 
keep skin healthy.  Protein helps maintain and build the underlying muscle structure of 
your face and body.  Staying out of the sun will prevent damage.   
People who are healthy look better.  When you are he althy and feel good, you will

Cosmetics 
Similar to vitamins, cosmetic products carry a lot of inflated claims.  For example, you 
may hear absurd statements like "specially formulated amino acids merged into deepest 
layers of the skin where they fuse with your  DNA to build new layers of strong cells that 
will make your face you look younger" or the like.   My gosh, it's worse than the vitamin 
hype! 
Often a $50 product is no better than be $10 pr oduct. The wrinkling of the skin as we 
age is a very complex process.  Ingredient s like DNA, RNA, herbal, seaweed & placenta 
extracts, liposomes, etc., do absolutely nothing to reverse the underlying process.  One big 
difference between over skin and younger skin is  that younger skin has more fat cells in the 
permits them over skin.  This is one reason ol der skin looks more thin and transparent.  
And for some unknown reason, the skin keeps growing and expanding as we age despite 
the fact that the fat padding decr eases.  That's why skin sags.  We also lose bone, and facial 
muscles lose their shape and firmness resulti ng in a drooping appearance.  What we learned 
earlier about DNA holds tr ue in the face, as well.  Protei ns and other chemical messengers 
no longer work as well, and we lose our ability to retain water. No cosmetic can fix this, 
but the aging intervention methods in this manual can partially it. 
Fancy fashion magazines don't tell you this.  Guess what?  Cosmetics companies spend 
millions of dollars advertising in them.   
So here's all you need: 1) A water soluble cleanser. 
2) A moisturizer.  And you don't need a speci al creme for around the eyes, a regular 
moisturizer does just fine.   
3) An oxidizer if you have blemishes (such as 3% hydrogen peroxide or benzoyl 
peroxide),  or and irrita nt-free toner if you don't. 
4) A sunscreen with as high an SFP (sun protec tion factor) as possibl e.  This can be 
combined with the moisturize r.  Sunscreen needs to be reapplied every few hours to 
maintain protection while you are exposed to the sun's radiation. 
5) A skin scrub.  Baking soda will do just fine. 
6) As an alternative to a skin  scrub, possibly an exfoliant.  An exfoliant peels off the 
top layer of dead skin, resulting in smoothe r skin and less wrinkles.  There are two 
categories of these.  Note: Do not use th e two of these togeth er, and excessive use 
can cause wrinkles. 
A) Alternatively (under physi cian guidance): Retin-A -- But this is not a 
cosmetic, it's a prescription drug, and s ubject to some guidelines for use.  
B) -or - Also physician guidance would be a good idea: Over-the-counter alpha 
hydroxy acids.  DO NOT USE Retin-A AND alpha hydroxy acids 
TOGETHER. 
215  
This just in form one of the health Ema il services I subscribe to: Skin specialists 
are warning that anti-w rinkle creams containing AHAs  (alpha hydroxy acids) 
may actually make the skin age more ra pidly. Research from the US Food and 
Drug Administration suggests that peopl e who use AHA products have greater 
sensitivity to the sun's ultra violet rays.   The chemicals appear to increase the 
number of cells that ar e damaged, and to stimulate reddening, blistering and 
burning.   Experts are saying that alt hough studies done to date show some 
worrying data - but those st udies have only been perf ormed over the short term 
and what is needed are long term studies  assessing the long term risk of using 
these creams on a daily basis as women would do under normal circumstances.   Some experts say that people using th e creams should not necessarily throw 
them away, but if used, al so use a sun screen with an SFP of 15 or higher and 
that should be adequate. 
 
There is a bewildering array of skin care products out there.  
 
Face Exercices 
My friend Dyana tried some facial exercise s. After a couple of weeks of pulling and 
stretching and making lots of f unny faces (that scared the heck out of her family), it sure 
looked like there were more wrinkles than when she began.  
Electrical Stimulation Devices 
Devices have come available that stimulate the face muscles by means of electrical 
current.  Electrical stimulat ion units for pain management, like the "TENS" units, have 
been banned for use on the head.  There is great controversy regarding whether 
electromagnetic currents are dangerous.  In view of the recent flap over the dangers of 
electromagnetic currents from  cell phones, I personally avoid exposure of this type.  
 
Some Things You Need To Know Be fore Considering Cosmetic Surgery 
I have been noticing a lot of people around Newport Beach lately who look pretty 
young from the neck up, but awfully flabby and old from the neck down.  Obviously not 
practicing precision nutrition and ex ercise, etc.etc.  And some of  the faces have that tight-
as-a-drum "wind-blown" look with eyes-perma nently-wide-in-surpris e as a result of 
schlock plastic surgery.   
My friend Marnie is an investment couns elor who speaks fluent French, and has 
enough joie de vivre to fill a Renault.  Marnie  sleeps with her eyes partially open, a result 
of blephoplasty (cosmetic eyelid surgery)  that was just a bit too aggressive. 
Although cosmetic surgery can make you feel  better which could result in positive 
physiological and some "antiaging" effects,  don't confuse looking younger from cosmetic 
surgery with physically being younger.  As prev iously discussed, the system in this manual 
will do much to improve your appearance. If  youthful appearance is important to you, 
you'll have less of a need, and delayed need, for such cosmetic surgery.   
There are some up-and-coming options to c onsider other than, or in addition to, 
cosmetic surgery.  Most of these are to keep  your skin looking younger.   They include laser 
systems that are said to stimulate collagen gr owth, microdermabrasion and the fraxtel laser.  
Also dental whitening proce dures performed by a dentist, and “Crest” brand whitening 
strips.  There are mist procedures that apply a “tan” and other tanning cremes.   
216 But regarding cosmetic surgery, well, like we ta lked about in the section on selecting an 
antiaging physician, you wouldn't perform your own brain surgery with you? If you're 
considering this, you'll want the best cosm etic surgeon. As with most any medical 
procedure, the quality and caliber of the practi tioner are absolutely cr itical -- and a botched 
job would be extremely difficult to repair.  You don't even want that taunt, wind-blown 
look characteristic of  cheap facelift. 
Any licensed physician can legally perform cosme tic surgery.  There is  even a report of 
a dentist doing boob jobs!  Dermatologists and ea r, nose and throat specialists also have 
made the transition to the potentially lucrativ e field of cosmetic surgery.  While it would 
seem logical that a doctor who knows his or  her way around skin, ears, noses and throats 
would be able to make this transition, this is  not necessarily so.  I would want one who had 
done cosmetic surgery, and only cosmetic surger y, (after initial traini ng in other kinds of 
surgery) throughout their entire career.  And I w ould want that career to have been a very 
long time and I would want for them to have performed many, many procedures. 
Become informed by reading at least a dozen books and articles on the subject (but like 
with nutritional supplements, be prepared to sort out some misinfor mation), and talk to 
people about their experiences. 
Plan on consulting with the least a dozen cosmetic surgeons.  Some will charge you for 
an initial consultation and ot hers will not.  You will want one who has done a lot of 
procedures, and preferably one who is up on the latest micro-surgical techniques.  Probably 
one who works on movie stars would be a good choice. 
The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons has some excellent 
brochures describing the various pro cedures. They're at (708) 228-9900.  
The face lift is probably the most common co smetic procedure.  There is a lot of 
disagreement over how it should be done.  Some surgeons will lift only the skin and 
underlying fat, others will cu t into and lift the "SMAS" (superficial musculoponeurotic 
system), and others will cut deep er and lift the sub-SMAS layer. The logic is that it is like 
making a bed, where lifting only the skin like only pulling up the top cover.  Going into 
deeper layers is like pulling up more layers  of covers. Surgery into the "SMAS" is 
somewhat riskier than only going into the ski n, primarily because the surgeon is cutting in 
closer proximity to nerves.  And even more ri sky for the sub-SMAS layer.  Severed nerves 
do not heal well, and can leave the patient with  permanent drool.  Still, in the hands of a 
very highly experienced practitioner, surger y into the SMAS and even sub-SMAS layers 
are RELATIVELY safe. If you're considering th is, gather a lot of information and decide 
on your own level of risk you would be willing to assume.  If it were me, I would go only 
with a SMAS, and quite possi bly a sub-SMAS procedure. 
 
Cosmetic Surgery for Men vs. Women – “There is a difference” 
Would you believe that standards of appear ance are different for men and women?  
This goes beyond just thickness of features, size  of jaw, various appendages, etc.  In a 
woman, arched eyebrows are generally consider ed appealing.  But in a man, thicker, lower 
"I mean business" eyebrows are considered generally more appealing.  It works for Tom 
Cruise, Kevin Costner, Tom Se lleck, and other film stars.  There is a psycho-physiological 
reason for that.  In the dawn of man and wo man, thicker and lower eyebrows helped keep 
the sweat out of the guy's eyes when he was hunting, allowing him to bag more game. It's 
not surprising that a guy who could bring back more protein would come to be considered 
more attractive.  This is one of those things that became hardwired in our neural circuitry.  
217 So if you are a man who is considering cosme tic surgery, you just may want to avoid a 
brow lift procedure called a "cor onal" brow lift.  It's so '9 0's.  I found so mething out the 
hard way once -- but luckily it was only tem porary.  I once went down to a local spa and 
got a "facial". The aesthetician asked me if I wanted to my "eyebrows done".  So I said 
"Sure why not.  But don't make me look feminine, OK?".  When I left, my eyebrows were awfully thin and way arched.  Not good.  Very feminine.  I had to buy a pair of horn-rimmed glasses to hide behind for about a week. 
Here are some of my own humble opinions.  If you are considering th is gather a lot of 
information and decide for yourself.  In my  opinion, if a man or a woman has puffiness 
under the eyes (pretty typical among aging people) I would be skeptical of a cosmetic 
surgeon who does not recommended something be done about it.  One procedure is called blepharophasty (removal of skin and fat ar ound the eye).  Another kind of procedure is 
done with a laser.  By the way, it is possible to take out too much fat from under the eye 
resulting in a sunken look.  La sering to tighten the skin and stimulate blood vessel growth 
below the eye is generally a good thing.  Please note: If he or she recommends it, it does 
not necessarily mean they can perform the proc edure well -- this is just one way to narrow 
the field.  And I am convinced that a coronal brown lift would be a bad thing for most men 
because of the way it lifts the eyebrows (may look good on women but probably not on a man), as well as the way the lift raises the ha irline.  These are my own guidelines, study the 
subject and talk to a lot of cosm etic surgeons and form your own.  
 
Botox 
Botox® is the brand name of botulinum toxi n type A that has been  in use since about 
1990. In 2001, botulinum toxin type B was intr oduced under the brand name Myobloc®. 
Both forms of this naturally occuring substance, are injected into muscle that is contracting abnormally.   It is a temporary solution to frow n lines.  It partially weakens the nerve to the 
muscle for about four to six months.  
Continued use of Botox® or its equivalent can result and sagging, and you'll look bad.  
The better solution is to be building the muscles and making them young again -- which 
will prevent them from sagging or wrinkling. 
A better solution to frown lines is to not ma ke them happen the first place by adopting a 
less stressful lifestyle. 
The aging intervention system in this  manual will do much to improve your 
appearance. Anyway, is it really necessary that  you be one of the "beautiful people"?  Will 
it truly satisfy you?  Is it anot her way for your ego to clamor for attention?   You're already 
purrfect. 
 
 
218 Chapter 10 -- In Closing . . . Our Future on the Planet  
"The mass of people lead lives of quiet desp eration. What is called resignation is 
confirmed desperation. "  
Henry David Thoreau (politically corrected a little by yours truly) 
 
Here's Some Great News!  
Whatever your situation or struggles, you can be happy now.  Life is ever-changing.  
For however long life lasts, make the most of it and be happy now. 
As we look back on the past weeks, we can  see that many great things happened -- and 
lots and lots and lots of bad things did NOT happen.  Still, we liv e in a world that is 
sometimes uncertain . . .  
 
Some a Few Things to Be Aware Of . . . 
Just as an example -- Imagine that your 7 year-old 
daughter's playmates come over and they all go to a field just down from your house to play.  It's dusk, they're laughing and playing tag.  Your kid's "it", so she's chasing 
her friend.   
Then all of a sudden, ka-blam! -- she's laying there in 
excruciating pain looking at  the bloody stumps where her 
legs used to be growing.  Th is is the situ ation faced by 
thousands of children due to the hidden land mines -- just 
down the streets from where they live.  So far over 7,000 have lost a limb in this way and many have died.  
Sometimes it seems there's a race between 
enlightenment and catastrophe.  This writing is intended to be optimistic. We can design our future.  But life isn't optimistic for many, especially  those who can do little to 
change their lives. 
Worldwide poverty, lack of adequate medical  treatment, human rights, child abuse, 
hate, inequality, animal cruelty, pollution, encroa chment on the forests, the dramatic loss of 
animal species, and world peace with freedom  from tyrants are issues of weighty 
proportions, among others.  
And long life vs. overpopulation is surely and issue here.  So we need to stay in good 
condition. 
I suggest that those of us with aspirations  of youthful joyous living for years, decades 
and maybe even centuries make a commitment to making the world far better off than it 
would be if we were not here.  You don't have to be Mother Teresa to make a difference.  
For those of us who are natural warriors and n eed enemies, consider the natural enemies in 
the form of the problems described above, or maybe in the personage of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse -- Famine, Pestilence, War and Death.  They are far more worthy adversaries th an one another. 
 
Earlier we talked about the kinds of diseas es and aging caused by toxins and pollutants 
that are being spewed into our environm ent.  And you have seen how the body is 
constantly renewing itself and how you get almo st an entire new body every year or so.  
This, of course, is made up of the food you eat , the water you drink, and the air you breathe 

219 -- and any toxins and pollution th at come along for the ride.  In turn, the toxins damage 
your DNA, cells, brain, and whatever  else they come in contact  with, bringing disorder and 
disease. 
When I was seven my dad, my uncle and I went  for a long walk in the fields far behind 
my uncle's farm in Iowa. It was a hot summer day and we were getti ng pretty thirsty.  We 
came up to a well and there was a hand-operate d water pump with a metal cup hanging to 
the side.  I can still remember how the taste of the water. It was unlike any fancy imported 
bottled waters. I'm grasping at words to descri be it's taste and purity and how it was in tune 
with the surrounding field and dist ant trees and sky.  The words "c lear", "natural", or even 
"bold" water do not do it justice. 
I wonder what that water woul d taste like today.  My guess: like sludge.  Or maybe the 
whole damn states been paved over. Someday soon I'm going back there and look for that 
water pump.  
Personally, I look to two sources of informati on in analyzing a situ ation.  The first is 
the opinions of experts.  While there is us ually disagreement among experts on just about 
any topic, today a majority of experts on envi ronmental matters agreed that global warming 
is happening -- with an increase of about one  degree of average temperature so far.  
My second source is what I can see, hear, feel, taste and smell for myself.  As an 
example, I have been reading newspaper re ports, and seen warn ing signs, in nearby 
Huntington Beach, CA warning swimmers to stay  out of the ocean because of bacteria.  
Recently I have been seeing similar warning si gns here in Newport Beach at Corona Del  
Mar (jewel of the sea), as well as Balboa Island -- both affluent oceanside areas.  
Pollution is getting pretty ba d everywhere and for everyone.  The Food and Drug 
Administration has warned pre gnant women to avoid certain types of dark meat fish, 
particularly shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish be cause they contain unusually 
high concentrations of mercury.  High levels of this type of 
mercury may harm an unborn baby's developing nervous 
system.   FDA is also advising nursing mothers and young children to avoid these fish as well.  The FDA also says "there are many varieties that pose few health risks and many benefits, particularly for pregnant women."  Surely this would be bad for anyone, not just unborn and nursing babies.  
Global warming results primarily from greenhouse 
gases emitted into the atmosphere.  These include carbon dioxide, methane (mostly from termites and cows), ozone and soot.  At this point I've seen enough evidence and am personally confident that global warming is a reality.  We've raised the temperature here on earth about one degree so far.  And surely this will increase exponentially if allowed to continue. There is 
now significant melting of the ice caps. The in creased heat, thereby increasing evaporation 
and energy in the atmosphere, is resulting in mo re storm activity that is killing and leaving 
thousands homeless.  There has been other undesirable weather conditions in the past 
decade, and harsher, and colder, winters and mo re severe snowstorms. If you've read this 
far you're probably planning to live here on good old earth for a while. If all this continues, 
by the end of this century an 11 degree increase in overall temperature, and a 20 in. rise in 
sea level are predicted.  Also plan on fi erce storms with 200 mile per hour winds.   

220 Most toxins, pollutants, and certainly  global warming, know no boundaries, whether 
they be borders or gated communities.  
Here in Orange County, CA beach closur es are now common and there's a County 
Environmental Health Dept. telephone hot li ne advising of unhealthful beach and ocean 
bacterial levels.  Today bacterial levels are high and people are advised to stay out of the 
water at numerous individual spots, as  well as from Doheny State Beach down to 
Capistrano County Beach -- about a 1/2 mile spa n.  The yuck tends to be particularly high 
near storm drains and other runoff.  
Sunny C. Jiang and colleagues at the Univer sity of California at  Irvine (UCI) have 
found potentially harmful human viruses in th e sewage flowing into the Pacific Ocean. 
Jiang and her researchers surveyed 12 river m ouths in Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego 
counties.  She found that four of the 12 sites sampled tested positive for the presence of a 
human adenovirus. They also found that the Lo s Angeles river mouth registered high fecal 
bacterial levels, the standard criteria now used  in California to eval uate water quality.   
There are more than 100 viruses found in hum an waste that can survive for as long as 130 
days in seawater.  
There are those who believe that cleaning th ings up and keeping it clean would best be 
spearheaded by grassroots effort.  And there are others who feel that it takes a 1200 pound 
gorilla (i.e. government) to keep the polluters in line.  Ultimate ly, it really boils down to the 
lifestyle choices people make.  
What will we do with those added years, decades, maybe even centuries?   
 
OK -- So Just Do It!!! 
These scientifically designe d, precision methods go far be yond "trying to eat healthy" 
and "getting a little exercise".  As you have found, this system has an amount of structure, 
requiring ongoing effort, attention to detail, and discipline.   These are the characteristics 
that distinguish the elite Olympi c athlete from the weekend hack. 
But just put these things into action for 6 weeks and you will be off the road to bad 
health, illness and unhappiness.  
You will experience a reduction in the pain, su ffering, disease and tri bulations that can 
come with poor health and aging. 
Sure, you don't have to be all obsessive about it -- just a few ex tra calories here and 
there or missing a workout once in a while are no big deal.  
But by following this system you will be great ly cushioned from the "thousand natural 
shocks that flesh is heir to".  By followi ng this system you will live a life filled with 
learning, happiness and fun, and liv ed to full potential, for a very long time. 
 
IT WILL DEFINITELY BE MORE THAN WORTH THE INVESTMENT!   
YOU'LL BE HAPPY AND YOU'LL FEEL GREAT! -- AND YOU'LL STAY 
YOUNGER, BE HAPPIER AND LIVE LONGER!! 
You are now an Olympian in the triathlon of  health, fitness & ag ing intervention. Your 
gold medal will be much more than a notic eable difference -- you will redesign yourself 
with new energy, vitality, performance and ha ppiness.  Your perception of the world, and 
the impact you can make on it, will never be the same.  Once you experience the benefits of 
221 this system, you will never give them up.  Youthful, joyous living for years, decades, 
maybe even centuries. 
We are honored that you have  read this far.   
How about using some of you're extra years, decades, or even centuries to make the 
world a better place?   
Be good.  Seek wisdom and truth.  Learn and improve.   Thank you, and bless you. 
     
222 Quick Review 
Make a copy of this and post it somewhere you'll see it every day.  
A goal is for you to be dancing joyfully on th is beautiful earth for a great many years to 
come.  And along with extreme longevity, you're en joying your best health ever -- vibrant, 
perfect health, no matter what your age.  Wh en we’ve lost our youth, our health and our 
vigor, we’ve lost everything.  And the same goes for a life that is not filled with vigor and 
joy, or lived to anything le ss than full potential.  
This system can help you attain a better quality of life. By following this system you 
are meant to experience much better health, mo re joy and happiness, more energy, a clearer 
mind with better concentrati on and improved problem solving abilities, a more carefree 
attitude, and a renewed enjoyment and spark of enthusiasm for life.  You can also have a better personal appearance and beauty, higher consciousness with a greater understanding 
of and capacity for spirituality and for making c ontributions to others and to the world.  
Also will come a more joyous sex life (whoopee!).   And a more keen wit (I amuse the heck 
out of myself these days, anyw ay).  You will find that you have the ability to work longer, 
harder and smarter in your work, increasing your ability to make money (or in increased 
satisfaction with life it self, and a perhaps a decreased need for the material).  And you will 
avoid making potentially hazardous mistakes. 
I only wish you could experience the benef its of this before making the modest 
investment in time that it will require. 
 
Medical Details -- and Follow Your Doctor's Guidance  
Review the "friendly" disclaimer at the star t of this manual. Have a complete physical 
exam (which is probably long overdue anyw ay) and get your doctors approval before 
implementing any of the ideas in this manual. 
 
If You Have a Medical Condition 
If you you have a medical condition, that cha nges things.  The system below should be 
modified to meet your special needs. 
 
Here's a Brief Recap 
1. Precision, scientifical ly designed nutrition  -- Six small, highly nutritious meals 
daily, 3 are regular food, 3 include prot ein powder as the protein source.  A 
balance of protein & carbs, with high pl ant fiber and low-fat, but 10-20% (ideally 
the right amount prescribed depending on the results of your advanced testing like 
the Berkeley Labs test) of calories from appropriate fats like  monounsaturated or 
essential oils.   Have a variety, chew your  food well, and include cold water fish 
daily.  Drastically reduce sugar, fat, de ssert-type treats, proc essed foods.  Avoid 
polyunsaturated fats, as well as saturate d fats.  Limit caffeine.  One or two 
alcoholic beverages per day (preferably re d wine), responsibly consumed, can be 
beneficial.  Refer to the OK to eat list and Glycemic Index List.  Watch out for 
restaurant food. This nutrition system is coordinated with your exercise system. 
2. High-Performance Exercise  --  Start off slow and be gin by stretching, and do not 
become injured. Exercise at least 20 to 30 min. each day.  Do it first thing in the morning. Work out with weights on 3 of th e 7 days each week, using proper form, 
single sets of three different exercise s for any muscle group, and bringing down 
223 the heart rate between sets.  Aerobic exer cise should be for 20 minutes, with your 
heart rate depending upon whether your goal is aerobic fitness or weight loss.  
3.  It doesn’t matter if you have a healthy 120 year-old body if you don’t know your 
own name or where you are.  This system is designed to keep your brain and mind healthy, as well as your body, so . . .  
 Cut the Stress -- Pay attention and recognize wh en you are stressed, remember 
how destructive it is, then do somethi ng about it.  Utilize meditation, deep 
relaxation, hypnosis or prayer.  Decide wh ether a high-powered lifestyle is worth 
the damage your incurring.  Just take a day off. 
4. Meditation  -- Twenty minutes a day.   
5. Get Happy  -- Decide to be happy, and do what you need to do to become happy. 
6. Sleep well  
7. Breathe properly  
8. Consider the value of spiritual and religious concerns  
9. Water  -- Drink about ½ to 1 gallon of water each day. 
10. Use appropriate amounts of well-designe d nutritional and perhaps hormonal 
supplements    -- Hormones, prescription medicati ons, herbs and the like should 
only be taken under the guidance of a phys ician who was highly experienced in 
these forms of supplementation.  
11. Reduce Risks  
12. Practice good dental care  
13. Other ideas not covered above  -- Stay out of the sun, don't smoke, have some great 
sex, and so on.  
14. Learn and do good in the world -- make the wo rld far better off than if you were 
not here.  
15. Re-read the entire manual every two months  
These scientifically designe d, precision methods go far be yond "trying to eat healthy" 
and "getting a little exercise".  As you have  probably found out by now, this system has a 
certain amount of structure, requiring ongoing e ffort, attention to deta il, and discipline.  
These are the characteri stics that distinguish the elite Olympic athlete from the weekend 
hack.  
IT'S WORTH IT! 
YOU'LL BE HAPPY AND YO U'LL FEEL GREAT! –  
AND YOU'LL STAY YOUNG ER, BE HAPPIER AND LIVE LONGER!!  
Just put these things into action for 6 week s and you will be off the road to bad health, 
illness and unhappiness. You will experience a reduction in the pain, suffering, disease and 
tribulations that can come with poor health and aging. 
The gold medal you will get will  be much more than a noticeable difference -- you will 
redesign yourself with new energy, vitality, pe rformance and happiness.  Your perception 
of the world, and the impact you can make on it, will never be the same.  Once you experience the benefits of this system, you will never give them up.  Youthful, joyous 
living for years, decades, maybe even centuries.

233 Quotes 
It always seemed there are so many  things to do in life that th e first thing to do is live longer.   
     Roy Walford 
All diseases will surely be cured, even old age. 
     Benjamin Franklin  
We are all amateurs; we don't live long enough to become anything else.    
     Charlie Chaplin  
There is not the slightest i ndication that nuclear energy  will ever be obtainable. 
     Albert Einstein 1932  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  R age, rage against the dy ing of the light.  
     Dylan Thomas  
Health is the first wealth. 
     Ralph Waldo Emerson  
There is no wealth but life.   
     John Ruskin, 'Unto This Last'  
The mass of men (and women) lead lives of quiet  desperation. What is  called resignation is 
confirmed desperation.   
     Henry David Thoreau (poli tically corrected a little by Adams) 
Life's Tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late.  
     Benjamin Franklin 
To soon old, too late smart.  
     old Dutch saying 
Time marches on   
     Albert Einstein? Fred Smith?   All I know is that it does (and sometimes it flies). 
Time is but the stream I go fishing  in. All of us enter that stream at birth and for a period of years 
we float along in different directions; experience jo ys and sorrows; taste the fr uits that life has to 
offer and, inevitably, one day the water disappe ars and suddenly we no longer exist. Death has 
arrived and our short time on earth has expired. 
Henry David Thoreau 
Ours could be the last human generation to suffer involuntary mortality.  
     Michael R. Rose, Professor of Biology at the University of California at Irvine  
If man made it, don't eat it. If it tastes good, spit it out.   
     Jack LaLanne  
Tell me what you eat and I s hall tell you what you are.  
     Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin 
which has morphed into " You are what you eat." 
Believe in the Magic of Your Dreams.   
     Spotted on a license plate on MacArthur Blvd. in Newport Beach 
Follow your spirit without hesitation.   
     Bumper sticker, Sy rrx parking lot in La Jolla 
Correlation does not necessarily mean a causal relationship.  
     Mr. Mason, my high school science teacher 
All men are mortal, Socrates was a m an, therefore, all men are Socrates.   
234      Woody Allen 
Is ditchwater dull? Naturalists with micr oscopes say it's teeming with quiet fun.  
     G. K. Chesterton, The Spice of Life , 1936 
The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.   
     Ellen Parr 
Motivation is what gets you star ted. Habit is what keeps you going. 
     Unknown  
Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by 
failure...than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they 
live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat. 
     Theodore Roosevelt 
Veins which by the thickening of th eir tunics in the old, restrict the passage of blood, and by this 
lack of nourishment destroy the life of the aged wi thout any fever, the old co ming to fail little by 
little in slow death.   
     Leonardo da Vinci  
The rapid progress of the sciences makes me, at tim es, sorry that I was born so soon... Imagine the 
power that man will have over ma tter a few hundred years from now: 
(1) We may learn how to remove gravity from la rge masses and float them over great distances; 
(2) Agriculture will double its produce with less labor; (3) All diseases will surely be cured, even old age. If only the moral sciences could be improved as well. Perhaps men would cease to be wolves to 
one another, and human beings will learn to be human.   
     Benjamin Franklin  
All the world's a stage, And all th e men and women merely players; 
They have their exits and their entrances; A nd one man in his time plays many parts, 
His acts being seven ages. At first the in fant, mewling and puking in the nurse's arms; 
Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel and shining morning face, creeping like snail 
Unwillingly to school.  And then the lover, sighing like furnace, with a wo eful ballad made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then

Internal Derangements of the Hip and Proximal Femur (Including Intra- and Extra-articular Snapping Hip)  By: Josef Kramer, Christian Czerny, Christian W. Pfirrmann, Sigfried Hofmann, and Anna Scheurecker   ANATOMY OF THE HIP JOINT The hip is a ball-and-socket joint allowing a wide range of motion in all directions. Active movements (flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, circumduction, and medial and lateral rotation) are possible. The femoral head is nearly completely covered by the spherical acetabular socket except for a small inferior medial aspect, the so-called acetabular notch, where there is no socket. The transverse acetabular ligament spans this deficient portion of the acetabulum. A triangularly shaped labrum rims the acetabulum. The labrum is thicker posterosuperiorly and thinner anteroinferiorly.1,2 The acetabular labrum consists of fibrocartilaginous tissue with fibrovascular bundles that are attached directly to the osseous rim of the acetabulum. It blends with the transverse ligament at the margins of the acetabular notch. Contrary to the shoulder, the acetabular labrum increases the depth of the joint rather than increasing its diameter.3 Clinical and arthroscopic studies have documented the importance of the acetabular capsular-labral complex as a biomechanical component of the hip joint.4,5 The joint capsule inserts onto the acetabular rim. Along the anterior and posterior joint margins the capsule inserts directly at the base of the labrum; a small perilabral recess is created between the labrum and joint capsule. The iliopsoas bursa, directly anterior to the hip joint, communicates with the joint in 10% to 15% of normal anatomic specimens and may be involved in patients with synovitis.6 The bony structures are protected by a mantle of muscles consisting of short muscles mainly. The femoral head, a region commonly involved in different diseases, is supplied by branches originating from the medial and lateral femoral circumflex arteries mainly.  RADIOLOGIC METHODS Because conventional radiography, ultrasonography, CT, and conventional MRI are routine procedures everywhere, and the technique of these methods is part of basic knowledge, in this chapter only MR arthrography is discussed in more detail.  Magnetic Resonance Arthrography of the Hip In most institutions MR arthrography of the hip is performed as a two-step procedure. Joint puncture is usually performed under fluoroscopic guidance. The patient is supine with the leg extended and slightly internally rotated. The puncture site can be marked on 
the skin above the femoral neck. This point has to be lateral to the femoral artery and below the inguinal ligament. Under sterile conditions, a 20-gauge disposable needle is directed straight onto the lateral aspect of the femoral epiphysis or craniolateral part of the femoral neck. A few drops of iodinated contrast agent are injected through an extension tube for avoiding radiation exposure to the hands to confirm intra-articular location. Then the iodinated contrast material within the tube is replaced by diluted MR contrast agent; following this, 10 to 20 mL of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) mixture is injected into the joint. This mixture consists of 0.2 mL of a standard Gd-DTPA solution (469.01 mg/mL, Magnevist, Schering AG, Germany) and 50 mL of saline, giving a 2 mmol/L Gd-DTPA solution. It has been shown to provide an optimal contrast between the contrast medium and the intra-articular structures or abnormalities.3 Imaging should be performed within 30 minutes after the intra-articular injection is finished, to prevent absorption of the contrast solution and to guarantee the desired capsular distention. Gd-DTPA and iodinated contrast material can be mixed before MRI without any release of free gadolinium and is safe for confirming the intra-articular placement of contrast material.7 It has been shown that intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA also leads to an enhancement effect of the joint fluid (indirect MR arthrography). This technique has been proposed as alternative to direct MR arthrography.8-11 Intra-articular enhancement in normal joints, however, is only mild and often heterogeneous, although exercise improves both the homogeneity and amount of enhancement in the joint. The main limitation is the lack of joint distention compared with direct arthrography. Studies have shown that patients who have undergone MR arthrography considered discomfort less than expected. Arthrography-related discomfort was well tolerated and rated less severe than MRI-related discomfort. Although patients expressed fear of certain aspects of MR arthrography, the reported average pain from the arthrogram was low.7 Despite its invasiveness, clinicians should not hesitate to order MR arthrography when clinically indicated.  OSTEONECROSIS OF THE HIP Prevalence, Epidemiology, and Definitions Osteonecrosis of the adult represents a well-defined circulatory osteopathy that progresses in different stages. The early preradiographic stages with nonspecific imaging findings are potentially reversible. Manifest osteonecrosis, defined by a subchondral defect in the weight-bearing zone of the femoral head surrounded by a reactive interface that is separating the necrotic area from living bone, is irreversible in almost all cases. 
Osteonecrosis is also known as avascular necrosis and ischemic or aseptic femoral head necrosis.12,13 Osteonecrosis after a fracture of the femoral neck (post-traumatic) or hip dislocation is caused by an acute ischemia due to damage of the vascular supply of the femoral head. In nontraumatic osteonecrosis, 80% of patients show several risk factors, which are associated with a heterogeneous group of disorders such as caisson disease, sickle cell anemia, Gaucher’s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, hyperuricemia, pancreatitis, alcoholism, or cortisone therapy. Thus, multiple theories about the pathogenesis of developing osteonecrosis exist. However, all finally lead to a common pathway of interruption of the local subchondral circulation of the affected bone.  In nontraumatic osteonecrosis the incidence has been estimated to be approximately 0.01% of the population, and about 10% of all total hip replacements are performed because of osteonecrosis. Bilateral involvement of the femoral head is frequent. Consensus exists that most cases of osteonecrosis have no clinical symptoms at the early beginning of the disease (“silent hip”).14 In this early phase the patients usually are not seeing a physician and therefore such “silent hips” were diagnosed incidentally, in most of the cases by MRI due to a painful contralateral hip or by serial MR examinations in high-risk patients.15  Pathology Histologically in the subchondral zone, necrotic bone trabeculae are embedded in necrotic marrow without any signs of remodeling or an insufficient repair only. The necrotic tissue is separated by a reactive interface from adjacent bony structures and marrow. The reactive interface consists of well-vascularized granulation tissue and thickened bone trabeculae covered with new bone formation representing an active repair process. Peripherally to the reactive interface sometimes edematous bone marrow changes can be observed.16-20 These latter morphologic changes beyond the necrotic lesion might represent the morphologic link between the focal changes of classic osteonecrosis and the diffuse changes in bone marrow edema syndrome.  Imaging Findings by Stage Imaging findings of osteonecrosis of the hip should be reported according to the international classification system of the Research Association for Osseous Circulation (ARCO), which should replace the several different staging systems used so far.21  Stage 0 In ARCO stage 0 all imaging findings are normal or nondiagnostic 
and because this initial stage without repair lasts for only a few days it normally will not be observed in clinical practice. There are only subtle histologic findings indicating the existence of this very early phase.  Stage I Radiography and Computed Tomography In ARCO stage I, only reversible bone marrow changes had occurred and therefore radiographs and CT still remain normal.  Nuclear Medicine Scintiscans can show a nonspecific “hot spot” with increased radionuclide uptake indicating enhanced vascularity caused by the repair process.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging On MRI a focal subchondral marrow defect shows the nonspecific pattern of bone marrow edema but no reactive interface. At this early stage MRI is not able to differentiate this nonspecific pattern from other subchondral entities with similar bone edema.22,23  Stage II  Radiography and Computed Tomography In ARCO stage II, radiographs and CT images are still equivocal, showing only a more or less mottled radiolucent area with osteosclerotic or cystic lesions due to the bony repair activity. Later, a sclerotic rim surrounds this subchondral lesion, indicating the new bone formation at the reactive interface (Figs. 21-1 and 21-2).  Nuclear Medicine On scintiscans an area of decreased tracer accumulation of the central necrotic lesion can be surrounded by increased tracer uptake at the reactive interface and residual femoral head. This “cold in hot” spot is pathognomonic of osteonecrosis.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging On MRI the subchondral necrotic defect now shows different signal alterations that are surrounded by a band of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, representing new bone formation at the reactive interface. In most of the cases, on T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced images, a high signal intensity line central to the low signal line (“double line sign”) is characteristic for the well-vascularized granulation tissue of the focal lesion, but insufficient repair can be seen.24 These MRI patterns are pathognomonic. 
Beginning with stage II, osteonecrosis can be sufficiently diagnosed by MRI and differentiated from pathologic alterations such as fissure, fracture, or contusion. At this point osteonecrosis has become irreversible and the necrotic area has been walled off from the living bone.25 This “point of no return” occurs much earlier than was presumed in the pre-MRI era, when the collapse of the femoral head was regarded as the point of no return. Some investigators have reported follow-up MR studies showing apparent healing of osteonecrotic lesions in high-risk patients.26,27 At least some of these cases included focal bone marrow edema lesions without a reactive interface, thereby representing ARCO stage I lesions, which are reversible.  Stages III and IV Radiography and Computed Tomography In ARCO stages III and IV the femoral head becomes mechanically unstable and a subchondral fracture, collapse of the femoral head, and, subsequently, secondary arthritic changes occur and can be identified on radiographs and CT images (Fig. 21-3). Although focal osteonecrotic lesions of all stages are significantly different from the diffuse bone marrow edema syndrome pattern, combinations of both imaging patterns can be observed.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging Characteristic MR findings for osteonecrosis in one hip joint and a typical edema pattern on the contralateral side are reported (Figs. 21-4 and 21-5).28 Osteonecrosis is generally accepted to be a progressive disease with a rate of collapse higher than 80% after 2 to 4 years, if they are symptomatic and left untreated.26 In the past few years MRI could clearly demonstrate that the stage, the extension, and the location of the defect are the most important prognostic factors.21  Synopsis of Treatment Options Conservative management alone with partial weight bearing or medication are generally regarded to produce unacceptable results. The clinical outcomes of electrical stimulation, magnetic fields, hyperbaric oxygenation, and extracorporeal shock wave therapy have not been successful in controlled studies so far. Sooner or later an operative intervention (total hip arthroplasty) is generally recommended and cannot be avoided.  LEGG-CALVÉ-PERTHES DISEASE Prevalence, Epidemiology, and Definitions Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is a juvenile aseptic osteonecrosis of the femoral head that is not an uncommon disease of childhood.29-31 
The incidence varies widely between 5.5 to 15.6 per 100,000 children younger than 15 years of age.32,33 Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease often leads to distortion of the size and shape of the proximal femur and results in disability.34 Prognosis in this disease is worsened by deformity of the femoral head and abnormal growth of the proximal femur, which may be observed as a consequence of severe epiphyseal or physeal involvement.35 Children suffering from Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease may even have growth disturbances caused by premature physeal closure.36  Pathology The radiographically unremarkable initial phase of the disease is followed by advancing sclerosis and a fragmentation as well as a reparation phase. Imaging includes plain film radiography, scintigraphy, and MRI.  Imaging Findings by Catterall Classification More than 20 years ago Catterall and colleagues characterized the different histologic phases of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease.37 The extent of necrosis using the Catterall classification provides valuable radiologic information for prognostic significance.38  Radiology Grade I In grade I only the anterior part of the epiphysis is affected. There is no collapse or sequestration. In the early stage of the disease metaphyseal changes are unusual.  Grade II Grade II shows increased involvement of the femoral head. The affected area is localized anterolaterally without involvement of the growth plate. Absorption and healing processes can be observed. The epiphyseal height is maintained by viable lateral and medial bony parts. Sometimes, small fragments, sequesters, and very rarely metaphyseal involvement can be observed.  Grade III Characteristic of grade III is that only a small portion of the epiphysis is not affected. On anteroposterior plain radiographs a “head within a head” appearance can be observed. Furthermore, collapse of a centrally placed sequestrum may be identified. Broadening of the femoral neck is a common finding and only a small, viable posterior segment may be evident. The course of the disease is similar to that in grade II, although metaphyseal affection is more generalized.  
Grade IV In grade IV the complete epiphysis is affected, leading to total collapse and ending with a mushroom-like appearance of the head and severe metaphyseal changes.  Patients with grade III and IV alterations have a relatively poor prognosis. Furthermore, Catterall improved his classification to increase the predictive value by adding four radiologic signs that may indicate a capital femoral epiphysis “at risk” for collapse. These findings consist of (1) Gage’s sign (a small, osteoporotic segment that forms a transradiant “V” on the lateral side of the epiphysis; (2) calcification lateral to the epiphysis (reflecting the presence of extruded cartilage and not influenced by an acetabular remodeling process); (3) lateral subluxation of the femoral head, which is highly predictive of severe deformity of the hip joint; and (4) a transverse epiphyseal line that may facilitate lateralization of the femoral head. A definite disadvantage of the classification of Catterall and colleagues is its late usefulness, because radiologic evidence of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease may be delayed up to several months.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging has been proved to be very sensitive even in the early phase of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease and is considered to be the method of choice for diagnosis and, especially, for follow-up examination.39-49 Early findings are marrow abnormalities in the femoral head (Fig. 21-6).50 These include loss of the uniform high signal intensity seen in the normally developing capital femoral epiphysis on T1-weighted images, high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and lack of enhancement of the femoral head on gadolinium-enhanced MR images. Other MR findings, especially observed in advanced cases, are decreased containment of the femoral head, such as deformity of the cartilaginous head due to abnormal thickening of the cartilaginous layer and synovial proliferation, thus leading to decreased acetabular coverage. In late stages also metaphyseal widening together with signal altera- tions is visible. The most important value of MRI is early detection of physeal abnormalities that are associated with subsequent arrest of growth and may lead to growth disturbances (Figs. 21-7 and 21-8). Early diagnosis is allowing earlier sufficient therapy and may help to avoid late changes or keep them on a low level at least. Choice of therapy is controversial, and different surgical and conservative treatment approaches are discussed.51-53   
 TRANSIENT OSTEOPOROSIS OF THE HIP (BONE MARROW EDEMA SYNDROME) Prevalence, Epidemiology, and Definitions  Transient osteoporosis of the hip is also known as bone marrow edema syndrome and describes a nontraumatic clinical syndrome characterized by disabling hip joint pain, focal loss of radiodensity on plain radiographs, diffuse increased tracer uptake in bone scintigraphy, and the characteristic diffuse bone marrow edema pattern on MRI (Fig. 21-9).17,54 Because of the more or less pronounced focal loss of radiodensity, it was first described as transient osteoporosis.55 However, in the French literature it is well known as a “topographic form of algodystrophy.”56 Bone marrow edema syndrome is a rare disease affecting predominantly middle-aged men (30 to 60 years), whereas women are younger (20 to 40 years) and mostly affected during the third trimester of pregnancy.57 The exact etiology of transient osteoporosis of the hip still remains obscure. Most of the proposed hypotheses are speculative but today multifactorial transient bone ischemia is regarded to be the main etiologic factor.58  Pathology The histologic feature of transient osteoporosis of the hip has been reported as focal areas of thin and disconnected bone trabeculae covered by osteoid seams and active osteoblasts.59 Plenk and associates reported marrow changes consisting of accumulations of fluid, fat cell fragmentation and fibrovascular tissue, bone marrow necrosis, and active repair processes. The usually vital bone trabeculae showed increased bone formation activity but no signs of osteoporosis on histomorphometry.60 A reduced mineral content and a shift to undermineralized bone could also be demonstrated by microradiodensitometry, possibly representing the substrate for the more or less evident radiolucency on plain radiographs. Several authors have described low-intensity bands within the bone marrow edema pattern and have considered them to be epiphyseal stress fractures or insufficiency fractures of the femoral head.61-65 Patients with bone marrow edema syndrome present clinical signs of nonspecific disabling pain in the groin, radiating to the buttock, lumbar spine, or anterior aspect of the femur. There is either an acute or gradual onset of pain, without antecedent trauma. In almost all cases the clinical course is self-limiting and lasts for 4 to 24 months.23  Imaging Findings Radiography and Computed Tomography 
On plain radiographs or CT scans, characteristic findings include more or less pronounced focal loss of radiodensity, blurring of the trabecular structure, and poorly defined cortical borders in the femoral head and neck, sometimes extending to the intertrochanteric region, which become detectable not before 4 to 8 weeks after the onset of the symptoms. The acetabular region appears normal.  Nuclear Medicine Bone scintigraphy reveals in the very early phases a diffuse, increased tracer uptake involving the entire femoral head and neck. Magnetic Resonance Imaging On MRI the bone marrow edema pattern variably extends from the femoral head, down to the neck and intertrochanteric region. A joint effusion is visible regularly on long repetition and echo sequences. Marked enhancement can be seen after application of contrast medium indicating the high vascularity.66  Synopsis of Treatment Options Because most of the authors believe that bone marrow edema syndrome represents a self-limiting disease, no treatment, other than protected weight bearing and analgesics until the symptoms have disappeared, is recommended.57 In some institutions core decompression is performed, which results in immediate relief of pain without any perioperative complications. This very simple and safe technique has proved to reduce the duration of symptoms significantly and improve the normalization of the signal alterations on MRI. Promising results by conservative treatment with a prostacyclin analogue have been reported and have replaced invasive techniques during the past years.67  BONE CONTUSION/MICROFRACTURES Prevalence, Epidemiology, and Definitions Bone contusions (bone bruises) are caused by injuries to bone due to direct contacts, compressions, or distractions.68 They are a common finding in the shoulder and knee joint, but they are rarely observed in the hip region.  Pathology On histologic evaluation, diffuse bone marrow edema, microfractures of trabeculae, and hemorrhage can be apparent.69  Imaging Findings Radiography and Computed Tomography By definition, bone bruises are not visible on plain radiographs or CT. Sometimes, in severe cases a focal demineralization zone may be observed on plain radiographs 6 to 12 weeks after injury.70 
Nuclear Medicine In bone scintigraphy, increased tracer uptake in the affected area may enable diagnosis.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging Nowadays, MRI is the modality of choice for detecting bone contusions characterized by a diffuse subcortical bone marrow edema (Fig. 21-10). Besides the diffuse bone marrow edema pattern, no signs of definite osteonecrosis or fractures are visible. There is no clear differentiation between bone bruise and microfracture. Even in bone contusion of joint structures, osteochondral microfractures may be possible. Plain radiographs are not helpful for detecting microfractures and are normally occult. The fracture line can be detected on high-resolution CT, however. On T1-weighted MRI, microfractures are characterized by serpiginous bands of low signal in the bone marrow coursing to the cortical surface. Even on T2-weighted MR imaging a thin band of low signal indicates the fracture line surrounded by bone marrow edema.71 Sometimes the fracture line is partially hidden by a concomitant marrow edema, and thus diagnosis is more difficult. Usually, compression fractures are similar to extensive contusions and characterized by star-like pattern surrounded by massive bone marrow edema. In contrast, distraction injuries may show only minimal bone marrow edema; therefore, without taking the patient’s history (trauma) into consideration, interpretation of MR images only may lead to a wrong diagnosis.72,73  STRESS/INSUFFICIENCY FRACTURES Prevalence, Epidemiology, and Definitions  Stress fractures can be divided into fatigue and insufficiency fractures. A fatigue fracture is caused by repeated overloading of normal bony structures (Fig. 21-11). In contrast, insufficiency fractures occur spontaneously, without any trauma or overloading through structurally impaired bone, as a result of diseases such as osteoporosis or osteomalacia (Fig. 21-12).74 Differentiation between microfractures and stress-related fractures is not possible with conventional imaging modalities. The patient’s history can help differentiate between microfracture (with a history of trauma) and stress fracture (with a history of overloading).  Imaging Findings Commonly, in insufficiency fractures, initial radiographic appearance is normal. Later, in the healing phase, sclerotic bands and subtle thickening of the affected cortex can be observed in most cases. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging The characteristic MRI finding in subchondral insufficiency fractures is a low-intensity band on T1-weighted images with an associated bone marrow edema pattern. Histopathologically the low-intensity band in insufficiency fracture represents the fracture line surrounded by associated repair tissue. However, because a low-intensity band has also been seen in cases of osteonecrosis the differentiation may often be difficult.61,75-77 Furthermore, because fractures often occur in the subchondral region in osteonecrosis, a serpentine appearance of a low-intensity line on T1-weighted images is not diagnostic for subchondral insufficiency fractures.78-82 Distinguishing an insufficiency fracture from primary osteonecrosis is important not only for the determination of the appropriate initial treatment but also for planning the effective preoperative and postoperative management. Knowledge of the patient’s activity level and possible trauma history should be carefully evaluated. Patients with osteonecrosis are generally younger, middle-aged, and have some risk factors such as corticosteroid intake or alcohol abuse.  LESIONS OF THE ACETABULAR LABRUM Anatomy The acetabular labrum consists of fibrocartilaginous tissue that is firmly attached to the acetabular rim.83 At the margins of the acetabular notch the labrum blends imperceptibly with the transverse ligament. The joint capsule originates at the acetabular rim adjacent to the labrum. At the anterior and posterior margins of the joint the capsule attaches at the base of the labrum, which creates small perilabral or labrocapsular sulci. At the superior aspect of the joint the capsule inserts several millimeters above the labrum, which creates a larger perilabral sulcus or recess. Histologic examination of the labrum has demonstrated that it is composed of fibrocartilaginous tissue and dense connective tissue.84 A wide spectrum of appearances of the acetabular labrum has been described in asymptomatic individuals.85-87 These different appearances are thought to be normal anatomic variations, but asymptomatic pathologic abnormalities cannot be excluded.  Pathology Pathologic changes of the labrum are believed to be part of a continuum of abnormalities that may cause early osteoarthritis. A twofold increase in the relative risk of chondral erosion in the presence of labral lesions has been reported.88 A mechanical etiology for labral lesions is proposed. Traction or impingement can lead to a massive loading stress of the labrum, which may cause fraying of the labral surface. Finally, labral tears and cartilage lesions may occur. Underlying mechanisms of the initial traction or 
impingement include developmental dysplasia and femoroacetabular impingement. Lesions of the acetabular labrum may be a cause of chronic hip pain in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hips, as well as in patients with a history of hip trauma.89,90 The hip pain often is accompanied by a click, or snapping sound, or painful “giving way.”  Imaging Findings Diagnosis of a labral abnormality, however, has been almost impossible both clinically and with conventional radiographic techniques.  Radiography and Computed Tomography Routine radiography may be negative or show findings of developmental hip dysplasia without specific findings of labral abnormality. Conventional arthrography and CT arthrography also have been disappointing in their ability to depict labral lesions.91 Better results should be expected for CT arthrography by using multislice technology in the future.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging of the whole acetabular labrum is difficult because of its anatomically complex location, small size, variable morphologic appearances, and redundancy of the joint capsule when there is no sufficient joint effusion distending the joint cavity.92 Therefore, detection of small tears and differentiation between tear and normal variants may be very difficult. Conventional MRI has been proved not to be sufficiently accurate for the diagnosis of labral tears.85,93-98 There are most likely many reasons for this inability, but inadequate joint distention that prevents separation of the labrum and capsule seems to be most important. Conspicuity of the acetabular labral complex can be improved by intra-articular administration of contrast material.99 In several reports, MR arthrography has demonstrated increased detection of labral pathology compared with nonarthrographic imaging, with a sensitivity and accuracy of 90% and 91%, respectively.93 Therefore, MR arthrography is the ideal tool for assessment of the acetabular labrum and is the preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of suspected labral lesions. Czerny and colleagues reported excellent results by using a special classification system for the description of labral lesions after MR arthrography is performed. T1-weighted spin-echo and gradient-echo sequences with fat suppression have been shown to be ideal for labral evaluation. Normal labra have homogeneous low signal intensity, a triangular shape, and a continuous attachment to the margin of the acetabulum (Fig. 21-13).100 A recess between the joint 
capsule and the labrum, a so-called labral recessus, that consists of a linear collection of contrast material extending between the cranial margin of the acetabular labrum and the joint capsule can be visible and should not be misinterpreted as labral tear.99,101 In hip dysplasia and severely degenerated labra this collection of contrast material may be enlarged and round. Because of degeneration, signal alterations within the labrum similar to degenerated menisci are observed. Higher-grade lesions show penetration of contrast agent into the labrum or, finally, detachment of the labrum characterized by surrounding contrast material (Figs. 21-14 and 21-15).  Synopsis of Treatment Options Because labral abnormalities are believed to be a precursor of osteoarthritis, surgical intervention will be influenced substantially by the type, extension, and location of labral abnormalities shown with MR arthrography. Only the accurate detection of these lesions may allow early therapeutic intervention and, therefore, relief of pain, and prevent or delay the development of osteoarthritis. Although MR arthrography is an invasive procedure with all the attendant risks and discomfort of such a modality, in patients with chronic hip pain in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion for labral abnormality, it appears, by virtue of its superior soft tissue contrast and its ability to allow direct visualization of the labrum, to be a promising method for assessing lesions of the acetabular labrum.  FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT Prevalence, Epidemiology, and Definitions Recently, femoroacetabular impingement has been identified as a cause for a progressive degenerative process leading to early osteoarthritis of the hip in an otherwise normal hip.102-108 Femoroacetabular impingement is a condition of abnormal contact that may arise as a result of either abnormal morphologic features involving the proximal femur and/or the acetabulum, or it may occur in patients with a normal hip who experience impingement as a result of excessive motions in the hip joint. Repetitive microtrauma caused by severely impinging the femoral head against the acetabulum during flexion and internal rotation may lead to degeneration of the acetabular labrum and articular cartilage. Usually, femoroacetabular impingement is observed in young and physically active individuals and presents as a slow onset of hip or groin pain.109,110 However, in patients with chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis, reduced antetorsion of the femoral neck and protrusio acetabuli impingement symptoms may be observed. Femoral head deformities, abnormal anterior femoral offset, and 
post-traumatic or postoperative rotational deformities of the femoral head can also cause impingement symptoms.111,112  Biomechanics Based on the femoroacetabular shape and the chondral and labral lesions, two separate types of femoroacetabular impingement can be distinguished.113 In cam impingement an abnormal femoral head with increasing radius is jamming into the acetabulum during forceful flexion (Fig. 21-16).114 The resulting shear forces produce outside-in abrasion of the acetabular cartilage and/or its avulsion from the labrum and the subchondral bone in a rather constant anterosuperior rim area. Chondral avulsion is observed first and leads to tear or detachment of the principally uninvolved labrum later.102,113 The main problem in the hip with a cam impingement is absent anterior-to-anterolateral waisting of the junction of the femoral neck and head, leading to a bump formation and/or the so-called pistol grip deformity (Fig. 21-17).115 During flexion the eccentric part of the femoral head slides into the anterosuperior acetabulum and induces compression and shear stresses at the junction between the labrum and the cartilage. The labrum is stretched and pushed outward, and the cartilage is compressed and pushed centrally, causing a separation between the labrum and cartilage, finally leading to cartilage and labral lesions. The second, or pincer impingement, is the result of an abnormal linear contact between the acetabular rim and the femoral head-neck junction caused by an acetabular abnormality. The dominant feature is that of a deep socket, in which the range of movement of the hip is limited by the overcovering acetabular rim (e.g., coxa profunda, acetabular retroversion) (Fig. 21-18). The first structure to fail in this situation is the acetabular labrum. The pincer type of impingement has more of a direct effect on the acetabular labrum than does the cam type of femoroacetabular impingement, and continued impaction of the femoral head-neck against the acetabular labrum can result in labral degeneration and paralabral cyst formation. These lesions were initially termed herniation pits and have been considered to be incidental findings in 5% of the population of healthy individuals (Fig. 21-19).116,117 The presence of abnormalities at the femoral head-neck junction is a relatively constant alteration seen in hips with associated femoroacetabular impingement.118 It has been suggested that owing to morphologic alterations affecting the proximal femur and/or the acetabulum, repetitive mechanical contusions occur during hip motion, particularly flexion and internal rotation. These contusions can lead to acetabular rim lesions that involve the labrum and, even more seriously, the adjacent acetabular cartilage. Therefore, in patients with symptomatic hips and associated juxta-articular fibrocysts at 
the anterosuperior femoral head-neck junction, a thorough investigation for the potential presence of femoral and/or acetabular impingement should be considered. Pincer femoroacetabular impingement is seen more frequently in middle-aged women who participate in athletic activities involving hip motion. Cam femoroacetabular impingement, however, is more common in young and athletic males. Cam and pincer impingement are two basic mechanisms and rarely occur in isolation.119 Most have a combination of these two basic mechanisms and are classified as mixed cam-pincer impingement. The damage to the cartilage in these cases is usually a combination of the two patterns of damage.  Imaging Findings The first step of diagnostic imaging for evaluating femoroacetabular impingement are plain films followed by MRI and/or MR or CT arthrography in cases in which labral lesions are suggested.  Radiography Although conventional radiographs often appear normal or almost normal, on detailed review, however, subtle abnormalities such as the presence of a bony prominence usually in the anterolateral head and neck junction, reduced offset of the femoral neck and head junction, and acetabular rim ossification or an os acetabuli may become apparent (Fig. 21-20). In acetabular retroversion on anteroposterior radiographs the crossover or “figure of eight” and posterior wall signs120-122 can be observed (Fig. 21-21). The crossover sign is created by the anterior aspect of the acetabular rim being more laterally located than the posterior aspect of the cranial aspect of the acetabulum.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computed Tomography A retroverted acetabulum can be seen on axial MR or CT images as increased coverage of the anterior femoral head. Nonsphericity of the femoral head, low offset of the neck, and cystic lesions of the femoral neck can be assessed by plain MRI easily. MR arthrograms, however, are also very sensitive and specific for detecting labral and chondral lesions.85,93,123  Synopsis of Treatment Options Initially, treatment of patients with femoroacetabular impingement consists of conservative management including modification of the patient’s activity level and reduction of excessive motion of the hip. If symptoms persist, or labral and/or chondral lesions are evident, there is an indication for surgical intervention. However, if only labral and cartilage abnormalities are treated, the underlying cause of impingement will remain present, likely resulting in persistent 
pain, further cartilage and labral damage, and, potentially, further acceleration of degeneration.124-126 Cam-type impingement is treated with femoral neck osteoplasty with removal of the nonspherical portion of the head, thereby improving the head-neck offset and creating clearance for flexion and internal rotation.127 In pincer-type impingement the femoral head-neck morphology is initially normal. The traditional treatment of these patients is reduction of anterior coverage by means of an anteverting periacetabular osteotomy or excision of the osseous prominence at the acetabular rim.108,113 If the patient has developed an extra-articular osseous prominence along the anterior femoral neck, an osteoplasty may also be performed.  SYNOVIAL OSTEOCHONDROMATOSIS Prevalence, Epidemiology, and Definitions Etiologically there are two different types of synovial osteochondromatosis. The secondary forms of synovial osteochondromatosis are associated with disorders such as osteoarthritis, osteochondritis dissecans, osteocartilaginous fractures, and neuropathic arthropathy. In those cases diagnosis is facilitated because of the underlying disease.128 The primary form or idiopathic synovial osteochondromatosis is an uncommon condition of unknown cause characterized by cartilage formation in the synovium.129,130  Anatomy Histologic findings include hyperplastic synovium with foci of cartilage metaplasia.131 The cartilaginous nodules are composed primarily of hyaline cartilage, and as they grow they may project into the joint space via a thin pedicle or may break off into the joint space, becoming a free body. The cartilaginous nodules frequently calcify. If an intact blood supply to the nodule exists, enchondral ossification can occur.  Imaging Findings Radiography The plain film findings of synovial osteochondromatosis have been well described and include multiple juxta-articular calcified and/or ossified bodies that tend to be of uniform size (Fig. 21-22).  Computed Tomography Classically, with CT, a soft tissue mass of water density is seen with multiple calcifications.132 In as many as one third of cases, however, no calcification or ossification of the cartilage occurs, making radiographic diagnosis of idiopathic synovial osteochondromatosis difficult without the supplementary use of 
arthrography.133-135  Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be an excellent method for evaluating synovial processes. As expected, the MR characteristics of synovial osteochondromatosis depend on the pulse sequence used and the presence and extent of calcification and/or ossification (Fig. 21-23). Hyaline cartilage–containing masses have been described as having a distinctive appearance on MRI, consisting of a lobulated mass of low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.136,137 When calcified bodies are present in synovial osteochondromatosis, they are visualized as foci of low signal intensity within the lobulated mass. Ossified bodies in synovial osteochondromatosis frequently have central zones of bone marrow. On MRI, these zones are shown as central areas of fat-like signal surrounded by a zone of low signal intensity corresponding to a rim of cortical bone. Distinctive MRI patterns can be observed with synovial osteochondromatosis corresponding to the presence or absence of calcification and/or ossification. These appearances should allow the differentiation of synovial osteochondromatosis from other causes of intra-articular pathology.  ILIOPSOAS BURSITIS Prevalence, Epidemiology, and Definitions The iliopsoas bursa is the largest synovial bursa in the human body. It separates the iliopsoas tendon from the hip joint capsule and the pubis. In a small percentage of the population it communicates with the hip joint via a congenital defect in the anterior capsule. Its extension may reach proximally into the pelvis and distally to the pertrochanteric region.138,139 The iliopsoas bursa, also known as the iliopectineal bursa, can be observed in 98% of hips.140,141 The communicating gap is usually collapsed and can reopen when a certain amount of intra-articular effusion causes increased pressure within the joint.142  Synopsis of Treatment Options Several pathologic entities responsible for increased joint fluid of the hip may lead to iliopsoas bursitis. However, even an idiopathic form of iliopsoas bursitis is known.143 Treatment of iliopsoas bursitis is conservative and only rarely is surgical management indicated. Detection of bursitis is often difficult by clinical examination only. Ultrasonography and MRI have been shown to be very accurate modalities for assessment of iliopsoas bursitis (Fig. 21-24).144–146 The iliopsoas bursa is seen as an elongated fluid collection located medial and posterior to the iliopsoas muscle and 
anterior to the hip joint. Even direct communication between the bursa and the hip cavity may be demonstrated by MRI or ultrasonography in most cases.  SNAPPING (EXTERNAL) HIP Prevalence, Epidemiology, and Definitions The term snapping hip characterizes a condition in which a clicking sound (“snapping”) of variable intensity can be heard in the hip region during motion of the hip joint, especially when the hip is rotated alternatingly.146,147 In contrast to the intra-articular click caused by labral lesions, the extra-articular snapping is caused by abnormal movement of the iliotibial band or gluteus maximus muscle over the greater trochanter of the femur or snapping of the iliopsoas tendon against a bony ridge.148  Synopsis of Treatment Options Iliopsoas snapping may lead to clinical symptoms and complaints. However, asymptomatic patients with definite iliopsoas snapping are not uncommon.149 If patients with iliopsoas snapping are suffering from pain, there is strong evidence for bursitis and/or iliopsoas tendinosis. In most patients, conservative treatment is sufficient and only in rare cases of complaints caused by iliopsoas snapping is surgical intervention considered.150 Normally, diagnosis of iliopsoas snapping is made by clinical examination, where a typical snapping phenomenon can be felt during hip motion. However, if an exact diagnosis by physical evaluation is not possible, dynamic ultrasonography may be of additional help. With ultrasonography, abrupt motion of the iliopsoas tendon relative to the iliopectineal eminence together with a snapping sound can be observed. Because of its inadequate dynamic capabilities, the value of MRI in the evaluation of iliopsoas snapping is limited and confined to exclusion of other hip pathologic processes.  SEPTIC ARTHRITIS A hallmark feature of any type of arthritis is a more or less amount of joint effusion. In septic arthritis fluid has in most cases a complex appearance and shows relatively thick rim enhancement after contrast agent administration.151–153 In contrast to transient synovitis, a feature commonly observed in children, involvement of bone marrow seems to be a specific sign for the existence of a septic arthritis.154 In those cases typically in addition to the joint effusion decreased signal intensity of bony structures adjacent to the joint space on T1-weighted images and increase of signal intensity on T2-weighted or short tau inversion recovery sequences caused by bone marrow edema are observed. Because of reactive marrow changes after contrast application, a definite enhancement 
effect is visible in relatively early stages. In later stages and especially chronic or healed phases, a spectrum from erosions to destructions or even deformation may be visible and can lead to difficulties in differential diagnosis. The clinical and laboratory parameters together with the history of the patient may facilitate the diagnostic considerations.  RAPID DESTRUCTIVE HIP DISEASE Rapid destructive hip disease has been reported several decades ago for the first time.155 Patients with this disease are usually elderly women and show rapid destruction of the hip joint that often occurs within months of the onset of clinical manifestations. The etiology is still unclear.156,157 Solomon and associates have suggested that hip osteoarthritis is caused by three interacting factors: mechanical stress, cartilage degeneration, and bone response.158 Regarding mechanical overloading it is well known that subchondral insufficiency fractures of the femoral head may occur in elderly patients suffering from osteoporosis. Furthermore, in rapid destructive hip desease it was speculated that subchondral insufficiency fracture of the femoral head due to osteopenia may be the cause of a rapid breakdown of the hip joint. Rapid destructive hip disease may be initially triggered by mechanical factors such as insufficiency fractures caused by osteopenia, posterior pelvic tilt, and mild acetabular dysplasia and advances to the end stage by inflammation caused by granulation tissue and insufficient response. In early rapid destructive hip disease radiographs show either normal anatomy or mild osteoarthritic changes. Follow-up radiographs, often obtained within a few months, demonstrate destruction of the femoral head and acetabulum with sclerosis, subchondral cysts, and mostly only minimal or no degenerative changes. However, also in patients with ischemic necrosis involving the entire femoral head, rapid destruction of the femoral head that often occurs within months of the onset of symptoms can be observed. Therefore, in these cases the differentiation between ischemic necrosis involving the entire femoral head and rapid destructive hip disease may be very difficult. Radiographically, the disease may also simulate rheumatoid or seronegative arthritis, neurophilic osteoarthropathy, or even septic arthritis.  References   1. Keene GS, Villar RN.

Ann Rheum Dis 1982; 41:118–125.  n FIGURE 21-1 Coronal T1-weighted spin-echo (A) and TIRM (turbo inversion recovery magnitude), (B) MR images show a small subchondral localized osteonecrotic area surrounded by a sclerotic rim. The adjacent bone marrow looks normal. On the image in B within the sclerotic rim a thin hyperintense stripe characteristic for granulation tissue (“double line sign”) is visible. n FIGURE 21-2 T1-weighted spin-echo (A) and TIRM (B) MR sequences. On both hips an osteonecrosis can be observed. However, a subchondral fracture is not visible. On the right hip, furthermore, a concomitant edema and a joint effusion are seen. n FIGURE 21-4 T1-weighted spin-echo (A) and TIRM (B) MR images. The shape of the femoral head appears slightly flattened caused by a compression fracture in an avascular necrosis of the weight-bearing area. A joint effusion and a bone marrow edema adjacent to the necrotic region can be observed. n FIGURE 21-3 Anteroposterior radiograph of the left hip shows a late stage of osteonecrosis with deformity of the femoral head and secondary arthrosis. n FIGURE 21-5 1-weighted spin-echo MR images (A, B, D, E) and 
TIRM sequence (C). Images D and E are from the same patient; however, these images are from an MR examination performed 2 years later. A small osteonecrosis on the left side and bone marrow edema without definite signs of osteonecrosis on the contralateral hip are visible. On D and E (sagittal T1-weighted image of the right hip) irreversible osteonecrotic changes on both hips can be observed. n FIGURE 21-6 Coronal T1-weighted (A, B) and TIRM (C) MR images in young individual. The right hip appears normal. The epiphysis shows homogeneous fat signal intensity. In the epiphysis of the left hip there are definite signal changes caused by bone marrow edema. Furthermore, minimal edematous changes are visible adjacent to the physis. However, the shape of the femoral head appears normal. A joint effusion is apparent. This patient is in the early stage of Perthes’ disease. n FIGURE 21-7 (A), Axial radiograph of the right hip shows a relatively dense epiphysis. T1-weighted spin-echo (B) and TIRM (C) MR images demonstrate inhomogeneous signal changes in the femoral head with a slightly thickened cartilage layer. Only minimal deformation and no massive fragmentation is visible. This patient had an advanced stage of Perthes’ disease with good prognosis. n FIGURE 21-8 On the axial plain film (A) of patient with known Perthes’ disease the epiphysis looks flattened and sclerotic, which means that only healing with defects is possible. Compared with the radiograph, TIRM (B) and T1-weighted spin-echo (C) MR images demonstrate similar findings, but reactive changes (bone marrow edema) characteristic for an active process can be delineated by MR only. n FIGURE 21-9 Bone marrow edema syndrome. On scintigraphy (A) an increased tracer uptake in the region of the hip is visible. MR images (B and C: T1-weighted spin-echo; D: TIRM) show a relatively homogeneous bone marrow edema of the right femoral head and neck region. No definite signs of osteonecrosis of fracture lines are demonstrated. n FIGURE 21-10 T1-weighted spin-echo (A) and TIRM (B and C) MR images show a subchondral bone marrow edema mediocentrally with a discrete extension into the femoral neck. On C, definite soft tissue edema is visible medial to the femoral neck. Although these findings are nonspecific, the history of the patient helps to make the diagnosis. The patient suffered a hip dislocation with spontaneous reposition. The diagnosis was a contusion and soft tissue injury. n FIGURE 21-11 Coronal T1-weighted spin-echo (A) and TIRM (B) MR images of both hips. In the left femoral neck (on typical localization) a fracture line surrounded by bone marrow edema is demonstrated. This is a stress fracture in a long distance runner. n FIGURE 21-12 Anteroposterior plain film (A) of the right hip 
appears normal (no signs of arthritis or fissure). T1-weighted spin-echo (B) and TIRM (C) MR images show a serpiginous line in the subchondral region of the right hip and an intense bone marrow edema, which is characteristic for an insufficiency fracture (fissure) with adjacent reactive changes of the marrow. n FIGURE 21-13 T1-weighted spin-echo sequence with (A and B) and without (C) fat suppression after contrast agent administration (MR arthrography). On A and B normal labrum can be observed. Image in C shows a minimally enlarged and rounded labrum with slightly increased signal intensity (typical for beginning mucoid degeneration). n FIGURE 21-14 T1-weighted spin-echo MR arthrography (A: with fat suppression; B: without fat suppression). On A a small tear of the labrum is visible. Image in B demonstrates a completely torn and detached labrum surrounded by contrast agent. n FIGURE 21-15 T1-weighted spin-echo (MR arthrography) without (A) and with (B) fat suppression in patients with hip dysplasia. A steep acetabulum and deformation of the femoral head can be seen. On A the labrum is enlarged and torn. In the hip of patient (B) the labrum is completely detached from the acetabular rim. n FIGURE 21-16 Anteroposterior radiograph (A) and cross-table view (B) of a right hip in a patient with cam femoroacetabular impingement. Note a lateral increasing radius of the femoral head and an absent anterior femoral waist (black arrowheads). The os acetabuli (curved arrow) is frequently associated with femoroacetabular impingement. n FIGURE 21-17 MR arthrography in a patient with cam femoroacetabular impingement. The transverse oblique 3D TrueFISP (fast imaging with steady-state precision) image with water excitation demonstrates the laterally increasing radius of the femoral head with a markedly reduced femoral waist and an osseous bump formation (white arrowheads) at the anterior aspect of the femoral waist. n FIGURE 21-18 Anteroposterior radiograph in a patient with pincer-type femoroacetabular impingement demonstrating a protrusio acetabuli. The medial floor of the acetabulum (white arrowheads) is protruding into the pelvis and the ilioischial line (black arrowheads) crosses the head of the femur. n FIGURE 21-19 MR arthrography in patient with cam femoroacetabular impingement. Radial reformatted image (reconstructed from a transverse oblique 3D TrueFISP dataset) demonstrates a flat anterosuperior portion of the femoral waist and a herniation pit (arrow). n FIGURE 21-20 MR arthrography in a patient with cam femoroacetabular impingement demonstrates an os acetabuli with 
high signal (curved arrow) between the ossicle and the acetabular rim and a herniation pit (straight arrow). n FIGURE 21-21 A and B, Anteroposterior radiographs of a hip joint with pincer-type femoroacetabular impingement demonstrating an acetabular retroversion. On B, the anterior wall of the acetabulum is highlighted with a white line and the posterior wall is highlighted with a black line. The crossing sign (white arrow) is the typical finding of an acetabular retroversion. Above the crossing sign the posterior wall of the acetabulum is medial to the anterior wall of the acetabulum, indicating retroversion. n FIGURE 21-22 The anteroposterior plain film (A) of the right hip shows only minimal degenerative changes. However, there are multiple tiny calcifications in the region of the femoral neck. The calcifications are detected by MRI (B) easily and appear as signal-less structures surrounded by joint fluid (idiopathic synovial osteochondromatosis). n FIGURE 21-23 T1-weighted spin-echo (A), TIRM (B), and fat-suppressed 3D gradient-echo (C) sequence. Plain film findings were not conclusive. However, they did not prove to be absolutely normal. MR images show only minimal degenerative changes (tiny osteophytes of the femoral head). Within the joint cavity there are many small solid structures embedded in joint fluid. The signal intensity of the intra-articular bodies is very close to cartilage tissue (ISO). n FIGURE 21-24 Sagittal (T1-weighted, A), coronal (T2-weighted, B) and axial (T1-weighted, C) spin-echo MR sequence. In this patient a contrast agent has been administered (patient was examined because of a pelvic disease). On all orientations a cystic lesion anterior to the femoral head is visible and shows a thin connection with the joint cavity (iliopsoas bursa).

Apportionment
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment
• One of the issues that a forensic examiner is 
requested to opine on is apportionment
• The principles of evidence based medicine or 
best practices applies
• This requires the forensic examiner to integrate 
individual expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
•Confronted continually by such issues, 
workers' compensation agencies have considered apportionment by cause as a 
means for dealing with these problems
• Apportionment by cause is, in essence, an 
attempt to assess how much of the damage that led to a disease or impairment was caused by one factor compared with others 
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
•Ideally, Workers Compensation Boards 
(WCBs) would like to compensate only that portion of a claim which was likely to reflect work related causation
• In principle, this would be very much like 
apportioning impairment, except that the underlying cause of the disorder is being considered rather than its expression in functional impairment
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
•The benefits of apportionment, if it could be 
quantified accurately and usefully, are obvious:
– adjudication may be simpler (especially if 
formulas could be worked out for relative proportions under certain assumptions)
– adjudication may be fairer to employers and 
some injured workers (although not necessarily the case being apportioned)
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Benefits – cont’d
– financial resources would not be depleted 
compensating for non occupational disease, incentives might exist for workers to take responsibility for their own health
– the burden of disease would be more fairly 
shared among health care agencies (in Canada, the provincial health insurance programs, the WCBs, and the specialized agencies for cancer and mental health, and

Benefits – cont’d
–the relative contribution to disability 
benefits for permanent impairment could be divided up and allocated to different payers
• pension plans
• private long term disability insurance
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Unfortunately, the limitations of 
apportionment are also readily apparent:
• There is an inherent lack of precision in 
determining degree of apportionment
• Unverifiable assumptions are required to 
determine apportionment
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Limitations – cont’d
•Partial benefits based on apportionment 
may not meet the total needs of individual claimants
• Agencies may resist cost sharing or may 
apply their own criteria, allowing some claimants to fall "through the cracks"
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Limitations – cont’d
•Apportionment performed inaccurately may 
significantly distort reporting of occupational disease
• Apportionment based on population 
estimates may not fit the individual case
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Limitations – cont’d
•Inconsistent application of apportionment in 
some cases and not other; may lead to inequities in the management of claims for injured workers
• Apportionment of many claims for small 
contributions to risk or impairment may result in numerous small payments that drain available funds and cause administrative difficulties
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Limitations – cont’d
•Workers may be subjected to policies that 
"blame the victim" for health outcomes
• Compensation benefits are remote and 
probably inconsequential in motivating health related behavior
• Thus apportionment, even under the best 
of circumstances, is not a panacea
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
The Concept of Apportionment
Apportionment by Cause
•Apportionment by cause is the assignment in an 
individual case of a relative estimate of the contribution to 
an outcome, such as a multifactorial disease, of several risk factors or potential causal exposures that are present in the case and are known to be associated with the outcome
• This is sometimes called apportionment of harm in the 
legal literature
– Boston GW. Apportionment of harm in tort law: a 
proposed restatement. University of Dayton Law Rev 1996, 21:267-378

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
•Basically, apportionment by cause is a 
process of allocating to each physical cause a relative weight proportional to the contribution of that cause to the sequence of events that led to the outcome, whatever the magnitude of the outcome itself

Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
•Example
– if exposure to heat, dehydration, lack of worker adaptation, 
and intense physical activity all contribute to a myocardial infarction in a case of heat stroke
– apportionment by cause see ks to determine the degree to 
which each external cause (occupational demands of the job, occupational requirements to work in heat, occupationally 
associated access to water or lack thereof, and non-occupational underlying disease) may have acted on an intrinsic  mechanism (the unadapted worker) to produce the outcome (heat stroke), whether or not the heat stroke led to a myocardial 
infarction

•Apportionment by cause may then be used 
to assess the relative contribution of each factor to final disability
• A particular cause may be 
– "necessary" 
– "individually sufficient" – "substantial and cumulatively sufficient“–"barely substantial but cumulatively sufficient"

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
•Causation is a difficult abstract concept
• There are many definitions and degrees of 
causation
• The term cause is used here to mean an 
exposure out of the norm of daily living that initiates or allows to come to completion a sequence of events that produces a disorder

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
•Risk factors may be proximate causes or 
markers closely linked to proximate causes
• Confirmed risk factors are described in 
various studies as closely linked to the disease outcome
• They may be sufficient to produce the 
outcome either singly or may act in combination with other risk factors

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
• This is a probabilistic (or "stochastic") definition 
because most such factors associated with disease outcomes are subject to a degree of uncertainty due in part to 
– measurement error– incomplete understanding– variability in individual susceptibility, and – the nature of the inherently random process

•At some point, an arbitrary decision must 
be made with respect to how proximate in the chain of events the risk factor has to be before it is considered too remote to be a cause
– For example, are advertisements for 
cigarettes a cause of lung cancer?

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
•Historically not, even though they affect smoking behavior, which 
controls cigarette smoke dosage,  and cigarette smoke dosage is a 
proximate cause of lung cancer
• Also, biological mechanisms such as hereditary predispositions are 
not counted as "causes in the usual sense“
– Rothman KJ. Modem Epidemiology. Boston: Little, Brown, 1986. 
Pg 7-21
but may be considered risk factors because they can be measured by 
indicators, and their presence or abs ence affects the means by which 
other factors operate

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
• The concept of apportionment by caus e is not the same as assessing 
the general contribution of different causal factors in a multi-factorial disease such as coronary artery disease
– cholesterol– blood pressure– serum high-density lipoproteins– activity level– obesity– family history– diabetes 
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
•This assessment of contribution is abstracted from 
the findings of epidemiologic studies, with the 
mechanism of each individual risk factor validated in animal or toxicologic studies
– Laboratory studies of multiple causal factors 
acting in combination are relatively rare, difficult to perform, and even more difficult to extrapolate to 
humans

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
• Apportionment, in contrast, must be performed 
on the individual case, which may vary greatly or in unknown ways from the population as a whole
• Often, the individual differences cannot be 
determined with certainty, and in such cases, epidemiologic data may be used to derive an estimate of the relative contribution of a risk factor in an individual claim

Documentation and Record Keeping
• Medical records should always support all clinical 
findings related to diagnoses, treatment  plans and billing 
practices.
• All practitioners are required to follow standard practice 
protocols.  This would include items like performing an 
appropriate history and examination based upon the nature 
of the patients presenting problems.
• Standard practice protocols should always be in 
accordance with accepted documentation 
guidelines/standards i.e.; CMS documentation guidelines, 
AMA CPT coding protocols, ACA documentation manual,
etc. 2
• Records should always be completed in a timely fashion 
typically during or shortly after completion of the patient encounter.
• Records should be comprehensive, but concise enough to
explain what transpired during the Dr./Pt encounter.
• Records should also be legible, clear, complete and 
accurate.
• All records should be initialed or signed by the 
practitioner (electronic signatures are acceptable).
• Records should always be maintained at a minimum 
according to federal/state statute or regulations (if possible my suggestion is to maintain records 
indefinitely). 
3
2• Records should never be destroyed during any civil, 
criminal or administrative proceedings. 
• All licensed practitioners and facilities must comply 
with all current state statutes and regulations.  
• All patient records should contain certain key elements 
pertaining to the initial encounter as well as all 
subsequent encounters. 
• See next two slides describing these specified elements.

findings to include any and all diagnostic studies that 
may be pertinent and/or clinically relevant to the patient 
encounter i.e.; imaging, laboratory records, etc. 
• Diagnosis and/or diagnoses • Treatment plan/recommendations, etc. • Date of initial treatment
5
Documentation Requirements for 
Subsequent Visits
• Review of chief complaint (history)

duration) as well as goals a nd objective measures (quality 
measures). 
• All subsequent visits should be documented using the SOAP
format i.e.; subjective, objective, assessment and plan
6
3Key Components Regarding 
Good Documentation
• Begins when the patient first 
enters the doctor’s office 
• Includes all medical information 
gathered
• Protects best interests of patient 
and doctor
• Required to justify the diagnosis/ 
treatment and substantiate 
medical necessity 
7
• Critical to avoid becoming a 
target or statistic of insurance/ 
Medicare audits, personal 
injury and worker’s comp reviews or State Board complaints
• Legally and medically 
necessary even if 100% cash
practice
• Good documentation also 
includes appropriate procedures regarding the informed consent process
8
Legal Requirements Regarding  
Informed Consent
4 Requirements:
•Information
•Understanding

9Daily Chart Notes
(SOAP Format)
•S-Subjective complaint
•O-Objective findings
•A-Assessment
•P-Plan
25
SOAP Note (S-Subjective)
S-Subjective complaint
• Documenting how the patient is feeling and their 
response to treatment
• Includes location of pain, quantity and quality of 
pain, level of function (ADL) and severity of pain 
(qualify by using pain analog scales and outcome 
assessment pain questionnaires)
26
Differentiating Quantity 
vs. Quality of Pain
Quantity:
• Amount of time patient feels pain per day
Descriptors of Pain Quantity:
Occasional
• Feels pain up to 25 % per day
Intermittent
• Feels pain up to 50% per day
Frequent• Feels pain up to 75% per day
Constant
• Feels pain all day 100% Infrequent• Not daily 
27
10Quality 
Quality:
• How pain affects patients function/ADL
Descriptors of Pain Quality:
Minimal Pain
• During ADL patient forgets pain 
Minor (Slight) Pain  • Pain doesn’t prevent patient from doing ADL if they 
briefly pause or change pos itions i.e.: sitting, lifting, 
carrying, pushing, pulling, dancing, housework, yard work, 
playing golf, working on computer, etc
Moderate (Significant) Pain 
• Patient is able to perform ADL, but pain forces them to rest
Severe Pain • Pain precludes patient from doing anything
28
Determining Severity of Pain 
• Use OAT’s (outcome assessment tools) 
• Begin at start of care to determine an initial 
baseline
• Use during follow- ups/re-examinations
• Use during exacerbations • Use at end of care/discharge of patient • Always calculate outcome scores and 
compare results of outcomes
29
Tools Utilized for Outcome-Based
1. Pain -(QV AS)-Quadruple visual analog scale & pain 
drawings to assess pain level 
2. Disability/Function -(Bournemouth questionnaires, 
Neck Pain Disability Index, Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale & (PSFS)-Patient specific functional pain scale 
3.    Patient’s Global Impression of Change-PGIC 
(assesses patient satisfaction and provides an 
ongoing evaluation of perceived progress with Tx)
30
11Benefits of Outcome-Based
• Enhances quality care for patients 
• Helps protect against liability• Improves reimbursement
• Provides better evidence for care  
31
O-Objective findings
• Documenting visual observation through 
(inspection)
• PE findings for documenting a “subluxation” 
(static and motion palp ation-includes PARTS 
system and/or AIR S & M) 
• Orthopedic and neurological testing, diagnostic 
and laboratory studies as well as physical performance tests all fa ll under this category SOAP Note (O-Objective)
32
PE Requirement for 
Documenting a “Subluxation”
PARTS System:
•P-Pain/tenderness -evaluate through Hx, observation,            
percussion, palpation and provocation 
•A-Asymmetry/misalignment -evaluate through observation, 
static palpation and static radiographs
•R-Range of motion- evaluate through active, passive and 
accessory joint motion (motion palpation) 
•T-Tissue (tone, texture, tenderness or temperature 
abnormalities)- evaluate through observation, palpation and 
instrumentation  
•S-Special tests i.e.: diagnostic studies
•Criteria: Minimum of two of the four criteria must be met, 
one must be the “A” or “R” followed by the “P or T”  33
12(Transforming PARTS System)
Utilizing AIR S & M 
Alternative Assessment Method:
Key Components:
•A-Ask Hx questions (quick scan)-pain now, recently or 
prior pain, any injuries/trauma or associated symptoms 
•I-Inspection -(DASEDD)
•R-ROM -(active/passive)
•S-Static palpation -(Soft tissue-4 T’s and Bony-MALT)
•M-Motion palpation -(general scan and accessory motion)
34
A-Assessment
• Diagnostic impression, short and long term goals
and expected functional outcomes
• The doctor should also evaluate the overall 
progress the patient is making with regard to their 
treatment planSOAP Note (A-Assessment)
35
Short and Long Term Goals
Short Term Goals
• Decrease muscle spasm • Reduce inflammation • Alleviate pain • Maintain ADL • Return patient to workLong Term Goals
• Increase normal physiological 
movements of the joints (ROM)
• Restore strength and/or 
endurance
• Increase flexibility • Increase physical work capacity • Return patient to full work 
capacity 
• Modify social and recreational 
activity (life style changes)
36
13P-Plan
• Document treatment received and frequency patient will be 
seen i.e.; 2 x wk for 4 wks with re-evaluation
• Document specific treatment goals (starting point and time 
frame for meeting goals) as well as objective measures to evaluate treatment effectiveness i.e.; standardized pain and functional assessment tools 
• Document procedures performed on the patient (be specific)• Indicate plans for future assessment i.e.; re-examination/re-
evaluation, prognosis, anticipated discharge, referral for 
consultations, examinations, treatment or follow-up 
diagnostic testing SOAP Note (P-Plan)
37
• Document any patient instructions i.e.; home 
care, ice, heat, belts, collars, exercises, work or 
home restrictions and nutritional 
recommendations
• Document in record if an  assistant was needed 
• Always perform a brief post assessment of that 
days treatment (post assessment is not considered 
a re-examination/re-evaluation of the patient)
• Always document next follow-up visit   • Always date progress notes as well as sign or 
initial SOAP notes when completed 
38
Benefits of Appropriately 
Documenting Progress Notes
• Reduces doctor’s risk of malpractice
• Helps document communication between 
doctor/patient relationship
• Assists in meeting NCQA guidelines• Assists with associates and covering doctor’s • Helps to document care and improve patient 
management 
39
14• Protects doctor with regards to HIPAA Privacy 
Standards
• Enhances communication with insurance 
companies (third party  payers) and other 
professionals 
• Improves outcomes with PIP arbitration
• Reduces cut-off’s from I.C.E/I.M.E doctor’s 
• Increases number of visits  available for the patient
• Increases doctor’s income

16Documentation Guidelines (E/M) 
Evaluation/Management Codes
• E/M codes are used for evaluation and management of new and es tablished 
patient visits
• E/M codes are usually , a covered service for non-Medicare claims when 
performed by a D.C.
• E/M codes are a non-covered service through the Medicare system when 
performed by a D.C. 
• Non-participating and participating Medicare providers (D.C.’s ) can charge
the patient for non-covered services
• E/M services which go above and beyond the pre and post CMT as sessment 
require the use of modifier 25
• Modifier 25 designates that a more comprehensive evaluation wa s performed 
than would typically be used for the standard CMT assessment
46
3 Categories of E/M Codes:
Office visits
•*Most important to chiropractic *
Hospital visits• More concerned with allopathic physicians MD, DO, etc

Medical Decision-Making:
• Refers to the complexity of establishing a diagnosis and/or 
selecting a management option 
Key items considered for M edical Decision-Making: 
• Number of diagnoses and/or number of management options
• Amount and/or complexity needed in obtaining, reviewing and 
analyzing medical data
• Risk involved regarding complications, morbidity (disease) 
and/or mortality (death) associat ed with the patient’s presenti ng 
problem, diagnostic procedure and/or management options 
• Note: The highest level of risk in a ny one of these categories 
(presenting problem, diagnostic procedures or management 
options) determines the overall risk Medical Decision-Making
66
23Four Levels of 
Medical Decision-Making
1.   Straightforward
2.   Low complexity
3.   Moderate complexity
4.   High complexity
67
Selecting the Level of Medical 
Decision-Making
Select Level of Medi cal Decision based upon the following:
1. Straightforward Medical Decision-Making
• Minimal number of diagnoses or management options
• Minimal or no data to be reviewed
• Minimal risk of significant complications, morbidity (disease) , and/or mortality 
(death)
2. Low Complexity Medical Decision-Making
• Limited number of diagnoses or management options
• Limited data to be reviewed 
• Low risk of significant complications, morbidity (disease), an d/or mortality (death)
3. Moderate Complexity Medical Decision-Making

Five Levels of
Nature of Presenting Problems
1.  Minimal 
2.  Self-limiting or minor
3.  Low severity
4.  Moderate severity
5.  High severity
Note:  These 5 levels refer to the reason the patient consulted you an d  
they also assist with determining the risks of the medical decision making process specifically the components dealing
with complications, morbidity (disease), and/or mortality
(death), as previously discussed

• A problem that may not require a physician, but service is pro vided under the 
physicians supervision 
2. Self-limited or minor presenting problem=Straightforward MDM
• A problem that runs a definite or prescribed course, transient  in nature and is not 
likely to permanently alter health status or has a good prognos is with 
management compliance
3. Low severity presenting problem=Low Complexity MDM
• A problem where risk of morbidity (disease) without treatment is low, there is 
little to no risk of mortality (d eath) without treatment and fu ll recovery without 
functional impairment is expected
4. Moderate severity presenting problem=Moderate Complexity MDM
• A problem where the risk of morbidity (disease) without treatm ent is moderate, 
there is moderate risk of mortality (death) without treatment a nd there is an 
uncertain prognosis or increased probability of prolonged funct ional impairment
5. High severity presenting problem=High Complexity MDM 
• A problem where the risk of morbidity (disease) without treatm ent is high, there 
is moderate to high risk of mortality (death) without treatment  or there is a high 
probability of severe, prolonged functional impairment 70
Counseling:
• Discussion with patient and/or family concerning one or more of 
thefollowing six items 
1.       Results of diagnostic tests and/or recommended diagnostic studi es 
2.       Prognosis 
3.       Risks and benefits of management/treatment options i.e.; inform ed 
consent process  
4.       Instructions for management/treatment and/or follow-up
5.       Importance of management/treatment compliance
6.       Patient/family education 
Coordination of Care:
• Consulting with other  health care providers
Note: If counseling or coordination of  care predominant then time is 
considered the key or controllin g factor to qualify for the lev el of  
E/M servicesCounseling & Coordination of Care
71
Time
• Amount of estimated time the physician spends with a patient 
• See E/M codes below for speci fic time factors regarding new 
and established patients 
New Patients: Estab lished Patients:
99201-E/M Limited                                                99211-E/M Minimal 
Time involved 10 minutes                                       Time involved 5 minutes

257 Steps on How to Select the 
Appropriate Level of E/M Service
1.   Identify the category and subcategory of service:
Category -office visit, hospital visit or consultation 
Subcategory -new vs. estab lished patient
2. Determine extent of Hx:
Problem focused, expanded probl em focused, detailed or 
comprehensive  
73
3. Determine extent of examination:
Limited, expanded, deta iled or comprehensive
4.    Determine complexity of medical decision-
making:
Straightforward, low complexity, moderate complexity, 
or high complexity
5. Determine nature of presenting problem:
Minimal, self-limiting, low severity, moderate severity 
or high severity 
74
6.   Select the appropriate level of E/M service based 
upon the following:
New patient- 3 key components Hx, examination and 
medical decision making, has to be met or exceed the 
guidelines to qualify for a particular level of E/M serviceNote: The lowest of the 3 key components determines the  
E/M code or it can be determined by time
Established patient- 2 of the 3 key components Hx, 
examination and medical decision making, has to be met or 
exceed the guidelines to qualify fo r a particular level of E/M 
service  
Note: The lower component of the top 2 key components
determines the E/M code or it can be determined by time 
75
267.  Assess Time:
Time is considered the key component to qualify for a  
particular level of E/M service when counseling and/or 
coordination of care dominates > 50% of the physician/ 
patient and/or family encounter  
This would be a face-to-face m eeting with the patient 
either counseling and/ or coordinating care
Time spent reviewing records without the patient does not 
qualify
Time is always rounded down not up

1Nutrition and the Gastrointestinal  
System
3 Hour Teleseminar
Part I
1
1. Esophagus
2. Stomach
3. Transverse  Colon
4. Small Intestine
5. Liver
2
Small Intestine
•All aspects of digestion
•Duodenum ‐absorption  of minerals
•Jejunum‐water soluble vitamins, CHO, 
protein
•Ileum‐fat soluble vitamins, fat, cholesterol,  
bile salts
3
12/8/2011
2PANCREAS  and LARGE INTESTINE
•Pancreas ‐
•Lipases ‐digest fats, along with bile
•Amylases ‐digests starch 
•Proteases ‐digest proteins into amino acids ‐
helps to keep SI free from parasites and yeast
•Large intestine –
•Absorbs water
•Absorbs electrolytes
4
Liver
•Metabolism  of proteins, fats, and CHO
•Detoxifying  hormones,  drugs, and toxins
•Manufactures  bile ‐digestion of fat and fat 
soluble vitamins 
•Bile is stored in gallbladder
•Bile keeps intestine free from bacteria, 
parasites,  etc.
•99% of bile is reabsorbed
5
Stomach acid
•Hypochlorhydria ‐deficient gastric acid 
secretion
•Achlorhydria ‐complete  absence of gastric 
acid secretion
•Ability to secrete acid decreases  with age
•50% > 60 years have low acidity
6
12/8/2011
3Symptoms  of low HCL
•Bloating, belching, burning and flatulence  
immediately  after eating
•“Fullness”  sense after eating
•Indigestion
•Diarrhea or constipation
•Nausea after supplements
•Itching around the rectum
7
HCL Doses
•Take 1 capsule (10grains)  at the next large meal
•At every same sized meal take an additional  1 
capsule
•SO, FIRST MEAL TAKE 1, SECOND MEAL TAKE 2, etc
•Continue until reach 7 capsules or feel warmth in 
stomach
•If feel the warmth‐took 1 capsule too many and 
reduce intake by 1
•Repeat to  be sure that the warmth was caused by 
the HCL capsule and not something  else
8
Digestive enzymes
•Pancreatin ‐preparations  of pancreatic  
enzymes isolated from hog pancreas

•Take with food for digestion purposes
•Papain‐500‐1000mg with meals
•Bromelain ‐250‐500mg with meals
9
12/8/2011
4Bowel Protective  Mechanisms
•Normal bowel allows absorption  of 2% of 
ingested intact food protein
•First line of defense‐
•Mucosal barrier & secretory  IgA‐gut 
surveillance
•Normally gut immunocytes  produce and 
secrete IgA
•IgA “blocking  antibody” ‐lines the intestinal  
tract
•Prevents antigen absorption
10
•Second line of defense‐
•Macrophages that  line the gut
•Dissolve or detoxify antigens or toxins
•Third line of defense‐
•If the antigen or toxin gets absorbed
•Kupffer cells‐macrophages  in the liver
11
Normal Flora
•“Mixture of organisms  found at an 
anatomical  site”
•Humans ‐consists of a few eucaryotic  fungi 
and protists ‐bacteria are most numerous  ‐
more than 200 to 400 species
•Mix of flora influenced  by genetics, age, sex, 
stress, nutrition,  diet, culture, and antibiotic  
use
12
12/8/2011
5•Dysbiotic ‐bad flora
•Symbiotic  ‐good flora
•Good flora ‐can compete with pathogenic  
species and displace them ‐produces anti‐
microbal substances  which inhibit the growth 
of pathogenic  bacteria
•You can re‐establish good flora after a few  
weeks
13
14
•Fetus is sterile in utero
•Colonization  of humans first occurs at birth 
with passage through the birth canal after the 
water breaks
•Handling and feeding of the infant after birth 
leads to establishment  of a stable normal flora 
on the skin, oral cavity and intestinal  tract in 
about 48 hours
15
12/8/2011
6•Three developmental  changes in humans 
that can affect the normal flora include ‐
•Weaning ‐flora in the intestinal tract
•The eruption of teeth –i n the oral cavity
•The onset and cessation  of ovarian 
functions  –i n the vagina
16
Unfriendly  Bacteria
•Most prevalent  bacteria –
•Bacteroides Gram‐negative, anaerobic,  
non‐spore forming bacteria
•They increase risk of colitis and colon 
cancer 
•Many of the normal flora are pathogens  or 
opportunistic  pathogens
17
Friendly Bacteria
•Bifidobacteria  ‐Gram‐positive, non‐spore 
forming, lactic acid bacteria
•Bifidobacterium  bifidum is the predominant  
bacterial species in the intestine of breast‐fed 
infants
•Appears to prevent colonization  by potential 
pathogens
•Used in yogurt and in probiotics
18
12/8/2011
7Where are they found?
•The greatest number of human adult 
bacteria are found in the lower intestinal 
tract (colon)
•Skin ‐1012bacteria
•Mouth ‐1010
•Gastrointestinal  tract ‐1014
19
•In the upper GI tract – esophagus
•Contains only bacteria swallowed  with saliva 
and food
•Stomach ‐Very few bacteria (mainly acid‐
tolerant lactobacilli)  
•At least 50% of US population  has the 
pathogenic  bacterium,  Helicobacter  pylori
20
•Proximal small intestine ‐sparse Gram‐
positive flora –m a i n l y lactobacilli  and 
Enterococcus  faecalis
•Distal small intestine ‐greater numbers of 
bacteria and additional  species ‐coliforms  (E. 
coli) and Bacteroides, in addition to 
lactobacilli  and enterococci
21
12/8/2011
8•Large intestine (colon) –
•Predominant  species are anaerobic  Bacteroides
and anaerobic  lactic acid bacteria in the genus 
Bifidobacterium (Bifidobacterium  bifidum )
•These organisms  may outnumber  E. coliby 
1,000:1 to 10,000:1 
•Coliforms  become more prominent
•Enterococci,  clostridia and lactobacilli  are found
22
MUTUAL BENEFIT ?
•Not much known about the associations  
between humans and their normal flora
•Dynamic interactions  rather than associations
•Both host and bacteria are thought to derive 
benefit from each other
•Most normal flora benefit their host ‐some of 
the normal flora are parasitic and some are 
pathogenic
23
•Normal flora gets –
•A steady supply of nutrients
•A stable environment
•Protection  and transport
•Host gets –
•Nutritional  and digestive benefits
•Stimulation  of the development  and activity of 
immune system
•Protection  against colonization  and infection by 
pathogenic  microbes
24
12/8/2011
9Benefits of Normal flora
•Synthesize  and excrete vitamins in excess of their 
own needs ‐which can be absorbed  as nutrients 
by their host
•In humans ‐enteric bacteria secrete
•Vitamin K
•Vitamin B12
•Lactic acid bacteria produce certain B‐vitamins
•Germ‐free animals may be deficient in Vitamin K 
to the extent that it is necessary  to supplement  
their diets
25
•Prevent colonization  by pathogens  by competing  
for attachment  sites or for essential nutrients
•Studies ‐germ‐free animals can be infected by 10 
Salmonella bacteria, while the infectious  dose for 
conventional  animals is near 106cells
•Inhibit or kill non‐indigenous  bacteria by  
producing  substances  such as ‐nonspecific  fatty 
acids and peroxides  to highly specific 
bacteriocins,  which inhibit or kill bacteria
26
•Stimulate  the development  of certain lymphatic  
tissues in the GI tract (such as the caecum and 
Peyer's patches ‐lymphoid  follicles in the 
intestine)
•The caecum (intestinal  cavity) of germ‐free 
animals is enlarged,  thin‐walled, and fluid‐filled, 
compared  to that organ in conventional  animals
•Intestinal  lymphatic  tissues of germ‐free animals 
are poorly developed  based on the ability to 
undergo immunological  stimulation  compared  to 
conventional  animals
27
12/8/2011
10•Stimulate   production  of natural antibodies
•Normal flora behave as antigens ‐they induce an 
immunological  response ‐an antibody‐mediated  
immune (AMI) response
•Low levels of antibodies  produced  against the 
normal flora cross react with related pathogens  –
and thus prevent infection or invasion
•Antibodies  produced  against antigenic 
components  of normal flora are called "natural" 
antibodies  –w h i c h are lacking in germ‐free 
animals
28
Harmful effects of normal flora
•Bacterial synergism  – between  normal flora and a 
potential pathogen  ‐One organism helps another 
to grow or survive
•Example ‐normal flora supplies a vitamin that a 
pathogen  needs to grow ‐called cross feeding 
between microbes
•Produce metabolites  that are carcinogenic ‐Some 
colon Bacteroides  produce carcinogenic  
metabolites  that may increase colon cancer risk
29
•Competition  for nutrients ‐bacteria in the GI tract 
must absorb some of the host's nutrients for their 
own needs
•Germ‐free animals are known to grow more 
rapidly and efficiently  than conventional  animals
•This is why antibiotics  are used in the food of 
swine, cows and poultry ‐the animal grows faster 
and can be marketed  earlier
•Unfortunately,  this leads to bacterial antibiotic  
resistance  in animals and humans
30
12/8/2011
11•Low grade toxemia ‐low amounts of bacterial 
toxins may enter circulation  – good or bad as 
these small amounts act as a bacterial antigen 
and stimulate  formation  of natural antibodies
•May cause endogenous  disease ‐Normal flora 
may cause disease if they reach a site or tissue 
where they cannot be restricted  or tolerated 
by host defenses ‐many of the normal flora 
are potential pathogens
31
•Transfer to susceptible  hosts ‐Some 
pathogens  that are part of the normal flora 
may rely on their host for transfer to other 
individuals  where they can produce disease 
•Examples  ‐upper respiratory  tract 
(Haemophilus  influenzae  and Staphylococcus  
aureus) –i n the gastrointestinal  tract (E. coli, 
Salmonella  or Clostridium)
32
Causes of decreased  intestinal flora
•Prolonged  use of antibiotics
•Prolonged  use of steroids and corticosteroids
•Prolonged  use of hormones  ‐BCPs
•Chemotherapy
•Stress
•Sulfa drugs
•Antacids
•Old age
33
12/8/2011
12Candidiasis
(dysbiotic/leaky  gut)
•Leaky Gut –F r o m possible increased  intestinal  
permeability
•Candidiasis  ‐Overgrowth of  candida albicans 
in mucous membranes  or hypersensitivity to  
the organism
•Fatigue
•Bloating, gas, pain, diarrhea
•Decreased  libido
•Increased  or chronic UTI and vaginal infections
34
35
Predisposing  Factors
•Previous causes of decreased  intestinal flora
•Decreased  digestive enzymes
•Drugs
•Nutrient deficiencies ‐almost all are needed for 
optimal immune functioning
•Chronic diseases‐immune suppression
•High sugar, high yeast foods  ‐(cheese, alcohol), milk
•Decreased  liver function‐toxins of candida are filtered 
by the liver
36
12/8/2011
13Treatment  strategy
To eliminate or  reduce the 
predisposing  factors and  causes of 
candida overgrowth  and the 
destruction  of normal good microflora  
in the intestines
37
4 step strategy
•Kill bad flora/yeast
•Heal the intestine
•Replace with  good flora
•Prevent recurrences
•Prior to the 4 step strategy you need to 
eliminate  the predisposing  factors that  may 
have caused the overgrowth
38
KILL IT
•Citriseed extract 
•Grape seed
•Pumpkin seed
•Garlic
•All will require approximately  3‐6 capsules/day
39
12/8/2011
14HEAL IT and REPLACE IT
•Glutamine 1 ‐2 capsules/day  usually 500mg 
per capsule
•Others –M C T s and butyrate ‐preferred  energy 
source in the colon
•Acidophilus 250 ‐500mg (tid) –t a k e with 
prebiotics
40
PREVENT IT
•Eliminate  predisposing  factors
•Multivitamin/mineral   ‐deficiency  of multiple 
nutrients is typically present 
•Increase fiber
•Decrease sugar
•Decrease gluten
•Yeast free diet
•Pay attention to medications
41
Sugar
•Eliminating  sugar, artificial sweeteners  and 
dairy products caused  a decrease in  incidence  
and severity of recurrent  candida
vulvovaginitis
•Study ‐in vitro ‐candida failed to grow in 
human saliva unless there was glucose
present
42
12/8/2011
15Parasite ‐Worms
•Worms irritate intestinal  lining and cause poor 
absorption  of nutrients
•Pinworms  ‐most common in us 
•Roundworms  –m o s t common in children
•Rectal itching *
•Weight loss
•Diarrhea
•Appetite loss
43
Diet Therapy
•Need to create an uninhabitable  environment
•By ‐Eating garlic ‐onions ‐Sesame seeds ‐
pumpkin seeds ‐figs
•Citriseed extract and black walnut
•Clove and oregano
•Avoid sugar
•Multivitamin/mineral
•Acidophilus
44
12/8/2011
1Food Allergy – Food Intolerance
•True food allergy ‐
•Immune system involved ‐Ige antibody 
activity and chemical mediators  released
•Food intolerance ‐no Ige response ‐
immune system is not responsible  for the 
symptoms  –e x p . milk allergy is different 
from not being able to digest it due to 
lactose intolerance
1
Statistics
•1 in 3 people either say that they have a food 
allergy or that they modify their diet due to 
discomfort
•True Food allergies ‐5% of children and 4% 
teens and adults in the U.S.
•Evidence of familial tendency
•Food Intolerance  ‐60% in U.S. have food 
reaction symptoms
2
Food Allergens
•Proteins within the food that are not broken 
down by the heat of cooking or by stomach 
acids or enzymes
•The proteins stay completely  or partially intact
•Cross the gastrointestinal  lining and enter the 
bloodstream
•Go to target organs ‐causing allergic reactions 
throughout  the body
3
12/8/2011
2Common Allergy Foods
•Adults
•Peanuts ‐tree nuts such as walnuts ‐shellfish ‐
milk ‐eggs
•Children
•Eggs – milk – peanuts
•Can sometimes  outgrow them (more likely to 
outgrow milk, eggs, or soy allergies compared  
to peanuts, fish, or shrimp)
4
Food Intolerance  due to ‐
•Contamination of  foods with microorganisms  
(bacteria,  and their products,  such as toxins)
•Natural substances  (histamine)  in foods (high levels 
in cheese, some wines, and in tuna and mackerel)
•Lactose Intolerance
•Adverse reaction to food colors, dyes, etc ‐(yellow 
dye number 5, monosodium  glutamate,  and sulfites)
•Gluten Intolerance
•Psychological ‐bad experience  associated  with food
5
Tests
•Skin tests
•Blood tests (RAST and ELISA)
•Double‐blind food challenge  ‐gold standard of 
allergy testing – foods are put in individual  
capsules –p a t i e n t takes a capsule and then see if 
a reaction occurs (Dr also blinded) ‐expensive  ‐
multiple food allergies are difficult to evaluate –
done infrequently
•Oral Food Challenge  ‐5 day pure water fast
•Oral Food Challenge  ‐Elimination  diet
6
12/8/2011
3Oral Food Challenges  – Elimination  Diet
•Elimination  followed by food reintroduction
•Lamb and chicken
•Rice, banana, apple, cabbage, Brussels sprouts 
cherry, broccoli, peach, beets, spinach, soybean
•Stay on diet for 1 week to 1 month
•If symptoms are  related to food insensitivities,  
they will disappear by  the 5th or 6th day
•Individual  foods are reintroduced  every two days
7
Therapy
•Avoid the allergic foods
•Vitamin A ‐15,000iu (bid)
•Bioflavonoids  – 250mg ‐20minutes  before 
meals
•Vitamin C ‐1 gram (qid)
•Bromelain  ‐125 mg 20 minutes before meals
•Zinc and Selenium  ‐15 mg and 100 mcg (bid) 
respectively
•Maintain fatty acid balance
8
Fiber Functions
•Decreased  gut transit time ‐?
•Delayed gastric emptying
•Increased  satiety
•Increased  pancreatic  secretion  ***
•Increased  stool weight 
•Better intestinal flora ***
•Production  of short chain FA***
•Decreased  serum lipids
•More soluble bile

Constipation
•Affects 2% of the US population
•Women and elderly more affected
•Going longer than three days without a bowel 
movement  is too long ‐After three days, the 
stool or feces become harder and more 
difficult to pass
•Need at least 3 bowel movements  per week to 
prevent toxins from accumulating

7Diarrhea
•Loose and watery stools
•Very common ‐Usually not serious
•Typically lasts two to three days
•Causes –
•Bacterial and viral infections
•Food – sensitivity  and allergy
•Medications  ‐Diseases of the intestines  (IBD)‐
Malabsorption  ‐Hyperthyroidism  ‐Some cancers 
‐Laxative abuse ‐Alcohol abuse
19
Classifications
•Osmotic diarrhea ‐something  in the bowel is 
drawing water from the body into the bowel –
(exp ‐sugar substitute  –s o r b i t o l  ‐not absorbed  ‐
but draws water from the body into the bowel)
•Secretory  diarrhea ‐body releases water into the 
bowel when it's not supposed  to –i n f e c t i o n s  and 
drugs can do this
•Exudative  diarrhea ‐presence of blood and pus in 
the stool ‐inflammatory  bowel diseases and 
several infections
20
Diarrhea Therapy
•Prevent or Correct Lost Fluids (Dehydration)  and 
Electrolytes  (Na and K) and Water Soluble 
Vitamins

•Upper abdominal  pain ‐usually 45‐60 minutes 
after eating or during the night
•Medical Therapy – Antacids  and Antibiotics  to 
eradicate  H. Pylori
•Diet therapy ‐should be aimed at increasing  
integrity of stomach lining and not at the acid
23
Causes
•Excessive  stomach acid secretion
•Helicobacter  pylori bacterial infection ‐primary 
cause of peptic ulcers ‐present in > 90% of 
duodenal  ulcers and 80% of stomach ulcers
•Excessive  OTC painkillers  (aspirin, ibuprofen,  
naproxen  and NSAIDS)
•High temperature  foods
•Heavy alcohol use
•Smoking exacerbates  and may promote ulcers
24
12/8/2011
9•Probably not stress‐patients with low stress 
levels have just as many ulcers as those with 
high stress levels
•Probably not fast food
•Elderly people have more stomach ulcers
•People with Type A blood are more likely to 
develop cancerous  stomach ulcers
•Duodenal  ulcers tend to appear in people with 
type O blood
25
26
Diet therapy
•High fiber diets‐promote mucin secretion
•Avoid sugar‐may increase gastric acidity
•Avoid milk‐has transient neutralizing  effect on 
acidity followed by a rise in acid secretion
•Eat early dinners and avoid late night snacks ‐
reduces acidity compared  to late dinners
•Avoid caffeine‐may exacerbate  not cause
existing ulcers and increase symptoms
27
12/8/2011
10Natural Antacids

group ‐Half of placebo group in same time
32
Non‐tropical Sprue
(Celiac Disease)
•Gluten (protein) induced enteropathy
•Reaction to gliadin ‐a polypeptide  derivative  of gluten

•More often in people who have type I Diabetes and 
Down syndrome
33
12/8/2011
12Etiology
•Villi in small intestine normally create a large 
surface to absorb vitamins, sugars, etc
•With the disease ‐the villi flatten out and the 
intestinal lining becomes inflamed
•Result ‐decreased  area to absorb nutrients
•Can lead to malabsorption – and  result in IDA, 
rickets, folic acid deficiency,  osteoporosis,  etc
•After the villi return to normal ‐months to years ‐
body can absorb nutrients properly ‐maintaining  
a gluten‐free diet even without symptoms  is very 
important
34
Symptoms
•Many have mild or no symptoms
•Symptoms  may come and go
•Gas, abdominal  swelling, bloating, stomach pain
•Abnormal  stools (diarrhea)  – constipation  more 
in children
•Weight loss despite normal appetite 
•Fatigue and weakness
•Vomiting after eating gluten (Children)
35
Treatment
•Gluten free diet
•No wheat, rye, barley, oats, buckwheat?
•Oats may gradually be re‐introduced
•No milk products
•In 2 weeks ‐most people improve ‐Symptoms  
should completely  disappear  within 3 months
•Read Labels ‐"modified  food starch" or 
"hydrolyzed  vegetable  protein" may contain 
gluten
36
12/8/2011
13•Corn, rice, millet and grits are allowed
•Flours and starches made from rice, corn, 
buckwheat,  potatoes,  and soybeans  are also 
okay
•Avoid beer ‐both with and without alcohol ‐
including lagers, ales, and stouts
•Papain‐500‐1,000mg/meals  ‐digests wheat 
gluten
37
Risks of the Disease
•Adults ‐slightly higher‐than‐average risk of 
lymphoma ‐usually develops in the intestine ‐
following a gluten‐free diet lowers the risk
•Slight increased  risk of esophageal  cancer
•Osteoporosis
•Anemia –I D A and Folic Acid def
•Infertility/miscarriages
•Frequent respiratory  infections
•Problems  with memory and concentration
38
Children
•In some ‐symptoms  begin shortly after introducing  
cereal in the diet ‐usually after 6 months of age
•Early introduction  of cows milk and cereal (wheat  may 
be introduced  after 1 year)
•Even if no symptoms  after eating gluten ‐child must 
stay on lifelong gluten‐free diet to avoid intestinal  
damage
•Children may not reach their full height or weight 
•Delayed onset of puberty
•Irritability
39
12/8/2011
1Diverticulosis  
Diverticulitis
•Diverticulosis ‐small mucosal sacs that protrude 
through the intestinal wall
•Low fiber diet may lead to diverticulosis
•Without fiber (bulk) – colon works harder to push 
the stool ‐pressure from this may cause pouches to 
form in weak spots
•Diverticulitis ‐sacs become inflamed ‐when feces get 
trapped in the pouches ‐allows bacteria to grow and 
leads to inflammation  or infection
1
2
Symptoms
•Can last from a few hours to a week or more
•Stomach pain –m o s t common ‐usually lower 
left side –a t times worse with movements
•Fever and chills 
•Bloating and gas 
•Diarrhea or constipation  
•Nausea and sometimes  vomiting 
•Not feeling like eating
3
12/8/2011
2Treatment
•During pain or an attack ‐Clear liquid or bland 
diet that is low in fiber until  pain goes away
•After recovery from an attack – Gradually  
increase the amount of fiber in the diet through 
fruits, vegetables  –h a v e a high fiber diet
•High fluid intake
•Avoid seeds, nuts, berries, popcorn ‐certain 
grains ‐may get trapped in the sacs and make it 
worse ???
•Multivitamin  and mineral
•Acidophilus  ‐destroys putrefactive  bacteria
4
Inflammatory  Bowel Disease
•Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative  Colitis
•Unknown  etiology 
•No cure
•Together affect 500,000 to 2,000,000  in US
•Men and women equally affected
•Commonly  begins during adolescence  and 
early adulthood  ‐but can begin at any time
5
•Crohns ‐Regional enteritis‐inflammatory  disease 
affecting mostly terminal ileum (any part of tract)
•Named after a physician  in 1932 
•Ulcerative  Colitis‐more common than crohns
•Inflammation  and sores of the lining of the large 
intestine (colon  and rectum)
•Loss of fluid and electrolytes  ‐water and minerals 
are expelled instead of being absorbed
•People who have ulcerative  colitis for 8 years or 
longer have a greater chance of getting cancer
6
12/8/2011
3Overall Symptoms
•Usually intermittent  (although  5%‐10% of people 
have constant symptoms)  
•Stomach pain or cramps
•Constipation  or Diarrhea (some have 10‐20x/day)
•Loss of appetite and loss of weight
•Bleeding from the rectum
•Loss of Weight
•Some have fever
•Other problems  may occur ‐joint pain, eye 
problems,  or liver disease
7
Therapy 
•Compared  to controls –t h o s e who develop 
crohns‐eat more refined sugar, less fruit, less 
vegetables  and less fiber
•Multivitamin  and mineral
•Need adequate  caloric intake
•Eat frequent and small meals
•Eliminate  refined CHOs and sugar ‐allows 
intestinal spasms to occur –a g g r a v a t i n g  the 
condition
•Increase fruits ‐vegetables  ‐fiber
8
•Elimination  diet is the number one therapy of 
choice

9
12/8/2011
4Lactose Intolerance
•Common in adults and runs in families
•Due to lactase enzyme deficiency
•Small intestine does not make enough lactase –
breaks down lactose–lactose  sugar remains intact
•70‐75% of Mediterranean  countries,  African‐
Americans,  Native Americans  and 90% of 
Orientals
•Most children lose the lactase enzyme by 3‐7 
years of age
10
Symptoms
•Mild to severe
•Develop during teen or adult years
•Begin 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating/drinking
•Bloating
•Pain or cramps
•Gurgling or rumbling sounds

•Modified elimination  diet  ‐Lactose free diet
•No milk or milk products ‐(lactaid and soy 
milk ‐ok)
•Most can eat some dairy or milk especially  
yogurt
•Take lactase supplements
12
12/8/2011
5Gastric Esophageal  Reflux (GERD)
•The lower esophageal  sphincter  (LES) is involved
•LES ‐Ring of muscle between the esophagus  and 
stomach 
•Normal digestion ‐LES opens to allow food into 
the stomach and closes to prevent food and 
stomach acids from flowing back into the 
esophagus
•Reflux occurs when the LES is weak or relaxes ‐
allows stomach contents to flow up into the 
esophagus
13
Incidence  and Symptoms
•More than 60 million American  adults have 
heartburn  at least once a month
•25 million adults suffer daily from 
heartburn
•Heartburn  and Indigestion  –m o s t common 
– burning  behind the sternum
•Being overweight  worsens symptoms
14
Triggers
•Top Three Triggers
•Fatty foods –s t a y in the stomach longer –
more acid produced  –l a z y LES
•Large portions –m o s t common ‐Stomach 
stretches or distends ‐pressure on the LES
•Late‐night meals
15
12/8/2011
6Avoid the Following
(Cause LES to relax)
•Fatty meals
•Milk
•Alcohol, particularly  red wine
•Spicy foods and black pepper, garlic, raw onions
•Chocolate  and Sugar
•Citrus fruits/products  ‐oranges and orange juice
•Coffee and caffeinated  drinks ‐Tea and soda
•Peppermint  and Spearmint
•Tomatoes
16
Lifestyle Changes
•Eat early dinner ‐Don't eat before bedtime ‐
Allow 2 hours to digest your food before lying 
down
•Small bland feedings ‐Eat five or six small meals 
each day ‐instead of several large meals
•Raise the head of the bed or chair
•Exercise – Crunches  and leg lifts can aggravate
•Jogging, aerobics and yoga may aggravate
•Avoid Smoking – relaxes the LES
17
Gas (Flatulence)
•Most common digestive problem
•Most people produce about 1‐3 pints a day 
and pass gas about 14 times a day
•Most foods that contain carbohydrates  
can cause gas
•Fats and proteins cause little gas
•These common foods and their natural 
components  may create gas
18
12/8/2011
7Etiology and Therapy
•Why? From three sources ‐
•Eating to fast or when upset‐(swallowed  air)
•rapid drinking, chewing gum, use of tobacco 
products,  sucking on hard candy, drinking 
carbonated  beverages,  loose dentures,  and 
hyperventilation  in anxious people
•Eating too much food‐
(overwhelms  digestive enzyme)
•Gas liberated by fermentation  of bacteria that are 
living on undigested  food
•Eating certain types of foods (next slide)
19
Foods to Avoid
•Raffinose  –c o m p l e x  sugar –B e a n s (the most) 
cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus…..  
•Starches‐potatoes,  corn, noodles, and wheat ‐
produce gas as they are broken down ‐Rice is the 
only starch that does not cause gas 
•Fructose – Onions,  artichokes,  pears, and wheat ‐
sweetener  in soft drinks and fruit drinks. 
•Dark beer and red wine
•Carbonated  drinks
20
•Sorbitol – sugar  found naturally in fruits ‐
apples, pears, peaches, and prunes ‐artificial 
sweetener  in sugar‐free foods

mild Traumatic Brain I njury (mTBI)
= a temporary loss of brain function associated with cognitive, 
emotional and physical symptoms
Concussion Causation
- caused by the head hitting an object or
an object 
hitting the head
- sports injuries, vehicle accidents, slip
and fall 
injuries, acceleration forces and
explosions.
Negative Pr
ogression
- easily repeated
- smaller impacts can recreate symptom severity- can lead to dementia, Parkinson’s and depression.

Concussion Definitions:
Concussions may 
involve both structural 
and neuropsychiatric 
factors
mild TBI -
may/may not include loss of consciousness and amnesia
Complicated mTBI -
abnormal neuro-imaging study (may include 
intracranial hemorrhage)
The presence of only one symptom is enough to  confirm concussion diagnosis according 
to the Consensus Statement of the 3rd Inte rnational Conference on Concussion in Sport.

5BASE Signs of Concussions
Balance errors - stand on one leg
Awareness - confusion
Symptoms - headache, nausea, dizzy
Eyes - pupil size, focus, lightsConcussion Signs and Symptoms:
[may be present in various combinations]
Cognitive = confusion*, concentration, slowed thinking, recall/amnesia {frontal lobe}
Emotional = irritable*, anger/violent, depression, sadness, anxious/nervous, highly emotion state 
{temporal lobe}
Physical = headache*, nausea, vomiting, balance, light/noise sensitive, vision changes, fatigue
Sleep = excessive, difficulty

7Concussion Grading
Critique
- Concussion grading has been used in the past to determine return to play for injured athletes.
[It is best to restrict return to play until symptom-free at both rest and exertion, normal values 
on neuropsychological tests, normal vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR = 4/4)]
- Most concussions (80-90%) resolve within 7 - 10 days.

13Physical rest
- exertion can aggravate symptoms [esp. cardio]
- only return to activities after being symptom free [light aerobics first, sport-specific drills, non-contact drills, full contact practice, then full contact games]
Cognitive rest
- reduce reading, focussing, concentrating, calculating which can irritate 
[ie. school work, texting, computer time, video games] - time off from school/work, attending partial days, educate teachers, staff, peers, coworkers about the need for less irritation [neuropsychological testing]
Avoid
- blood thinners, alcohol and NSAIDs [complicate intracranial hemorrhage]
Biofeedback
- self-regulation of brainwaves [reduced activity], compare to normal values 
Manual manipulation
- avoid HVLA moves, use soft tissue techniques and instruments [low force]
Traction/spinal decompression
- inflatable neck collar, tables, inversion [caution]How do you treat concussions?

16Post-concussion syndrome
- symptoms may last months, years or become permanent 
[headaches, dizzy, fatigue, memory, sleep disorders and irritability]
Cumulative effects
- 3 or more concussions lead to long-term memory loss, depression and
a five-fold greater chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease
Dementia Pugilistica [punch drunk, NFL]
- results in speech problems, memory deficits, tremors, inappropriate behaviors, 
slowed mental processing and Parkinson’s disease [chronic encephalopathy]
Second-impact syndrome [fatal]
- Brain swells due to loss of control of blood flow 
and vessel diameter. 
- Brain stem herniation can occur within 5 minutes. - Most cases are under 20 years old- 3 times more likely to occur in high school 
football athletes.What affects the prognosis of TBI?

27Static vs. Dynamic Motion Analysis
Evaluate cross-plane movement and cervical circumduction 
Locating dysfunction
- use a clockface to note zone of abnormal motion 
- explore pain/tension/pressure
Perform clockwise and counterclockwise motions
-dysfunction usually occurs in only one direction
(example) 
- Clockwise circumduction of the skull notes 
loss of coordinated motion from 12:00 to 4:00. 
Sharp pain is reported from 4:00 to 6:00 and 
10:00 to 12:00 in the right C5 region. 
- Counter-clockwise circumduction of the skull 
reveals sharp pain from 4:00 to 2:00 and loss 
of motion from 2:00 to 12:00.

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment of Fault (and Damages)
•Perhaps the most common use of the term 
apportionment is in assigning estimate of 
blame, fault, or contribution to injury in a tort case for each the parties that may have contributed to the injury
– defendants
• The concept of fault is the essential key to the assessment of damages in tort litigation

Apportionment of Fault (and Damages) – cont’d
• In particular, apportionment for contributory 
negligence, assessing whether the plaintiff may have contributed to the injury by failing to protect himself or herself, is a subject of legal debate with a history dating to Roman times 
– White RB, III.  Comparative responsibility sometimes:

Apportionment of Fault (and Damages) – cont’d
•Apportionment in this context may be conducted 
several ways, but the most common approaches are 
– "comparative negligence“
• responsibility for damages is divided between the plaintiff and 
the defendant
– "joint and several liability“
• the share apportioned to the defendants as a group is distributed among the various defendants according to each one's share of liability

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment of Fault (and Damages) – cont’d
• The essential difference between apportionment 
of fault and apportionment by cause is that apportionment of fault assumes responsibility on the part of a human agency or defendant who had responsibility in the situation
• In contrast, apportionment by cause is an 
estimate of the relative magnitude of contribution of a set of physical causes or conditions, without regard to the intent of or circumstances of exposure

Apportionment of Fault (and Damages) – cont’d
• While apportionment of fault is almost entirely an issue of 
damages, the two types of apportionment are indivisible in practice
•In the arena of workers' compensa tion,  apportionment of fault is 
not relevant because workers' compensation is a "no fault" system that explicitly rejects joint and seve ral liability in favor of a social 
policy of pooled risk in the comm on interest of employers and 
workers

for reform. Maine Law Rev 1983, 34:367-405

Apportionment of Impairment
•In the assessment of functional 
impairment, there may be more than one injury or condition that limits use of a body part or that contributes to total impairment
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment of Impairment – cont’d
•Most common example in workers' compensation is a 
work related injury followed by another nominally unrelated 
work related reinjury (sometimes related because of weakness or incomplete recovery) or an injury to an individual who already had an im pairment as a result of a 
pre existing condition unrelated to work
– arthritis– non occupational back pain

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment of Impairment – cont’d
•In this situation, the practice is to assess 
the contribution to impairment of the relevant work related injury alone, usually by taking total impairment and subtracting the degree of impairment that already existed, if this is known or can be estimated

Apportionment of Impairment – cont’d
• The essential difference between apportionment 
of impairment and apportionment by cause is that
–apportionment of impairment is based on a widely 
accepted system of impairment rating (eg., AMA Guides
5thedition) that relates to functional capacity and 
therefore outcome, whereas 
– apportionment by cause is an attempt to assign 
relative weights to those factors which contributed to the outcome, whatever the magnitude of the outcome may be

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment of Disability
•Apportionment of disability is the same as 
apportionment of impairment after the impairment 
rating is converted into a disability rating
• Disability reflects more than lack of functional 
capacity
– it also reflects the social and recreational context 
in which the claimant functions and the implications of the impairment for employment (job market)

The Concept of Apportionment –cont’d
Apportionment of Disability – cont’d
•The apportionment of disability is the same 
as apportionment of impairment except that these factors are taken into account, and disability is the index rather than impairment rating
• Therefore, the relative degrees 
apportioned to each injury will be the same

• It is dealt with within various workers' compensation 
systems in one of three ways:
– through the "full responsibility rule“
• the last employer bears full responsibility for disability resulting from the last significant injury
– through the apportionment of liability between the original and 
later employers based on history or risk of injury
• with obvious implications for repetitive strain injuries
– through second injury funds

Apportionment by Cause
Basic Concepts
•As stated previously, apportionment is a 
process of determining relative contributions to an outcome in an individual case
•Attribution , as it is typically used in 
epidemiology, is determination of the magnitude of contribution to risk in a population
– measured by the attributable risk
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Basic Concepts – cont’d
•Colloquially, attribution also may be used in reference to 
an individual case but usually in the same sense as 
presumption; that is, a case of lung cancer is "attributed" to smoking or asbestos but not both
• Thus,
–attribution refers to a particular putative cause
–apportionment refers to the process of determining 
the relative contributions of different possible or putative causes

•Comparing each risk factor with the others, it

DIVERSIFY YOUR HEALTHCARE PRACTICE:  
Become a culturally competent provider 
 
Caring for: Asians, Blacks, Middle Easterners  
“We become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosai c. Different people, different beliefs, different 
yearnings, different hopes, different dreams.” Jimmy Carter  
 
Introduction  
We are all aware of the changing demographics of the United States. Some of us may even be 
thinking about the potential impact of these changes on all healthcare professions, especially our 
own, as well as our practice. You may have even wondered if providers and patients are represented 
proportionally in healthcare practices. Are patients from diverse cultural and racial backgrounds  
being cared for in the manner that is best for them? It is in response to these questions that I have 
created cultural competency courses such as this one.  
Immigrants move from one country to another for a variety of reasons. These reasons are divided into two types: “push” factors (things that occur in a nation that make it necessary for people to leave, 
such as wars or lack of jobs) and “pull” factors (things that exist in the receiving nation that make people want to go there, such as the presence of family members or an abundance of jobs).  
 
QUESTION : Are you and your staff prepared to appropriately and respectfully take care of the 
people who come to your office from all over the world and from all racial and ethnic backgrounds?  
 
We are growing up  
We are many colors of skin  
We are many languages  
We are many ages and sizes  
We are many countries  
But we are one earth.  
2 
 We are growing up, together,  
So we must each join our  
Hearts and lives together  
And live as one family  
MATTY STEPANEK  
From: Jeni Stepanek, Messenger (New York: Dutton, 2009).  
 
DISCLAIMER : Below you will find discussions and information about people who might come to 
you in t he future or who could be patients of yours right now: Blacks, Asians and Middle Easterners. 
Much of what you will read will contain generalizations and as with all generalizations, IT IS NOT 
POSSIBLE TO GENERALIZE WITH ACCURACY! Please keep this in mind, because any 
individual who walks into your office, may or may not conform to these generalizations. As with 
anyone who comes to you for care, it is always essential to be open to the person in front of you 
without categorization. AND it is also extremely important to be aware that individuals and families 
in the United States for longer periods of time MAY conform less to the cultural norm of their countries of origin.  
 
Are We Still A Melting Pot??  
Our country was truly a "melting pot" in the last century , but as many of us have probably figured 
out, we are no longer. Today, there are a large number of people with a variety of cultures that are 
not "melting" but instead are holding on to their culture. We are now more of a “salad bowl” or a 
“mosaic.”  
 
Are We No Longer A Melting Pot?  
• We may or may not look different than the general population.  
• Some of the cultures coming to the U.S. are not integrating as in the past.  
• In my opinion, the U.S. population has become somewhat more tolerant of people who spe ak 
different languages and have different lifestyles, etc.  
 
Self-Evaluation Regarding People Who Are Different Than Us  
What Is Your Cultural IQ?  
• What do you think about cultural differences? What are your thoughts concerning people 
who have come to our country from elsewhere? In truth, all of us have come here from 
somewhere else. Some of us just came here sooner. Even Native Americans, who have been in America the longest, are thought to have come from somewhere else.  
 
QUESTION: What do you think your cultural IQ might be? Is it high or low?  
• Some believe that "Cultural Humility" would be a better characterization of what is required 
by us than "Cultural Competency." The term "competency" implies that there is a set of skills 
that are needed and that wh en these skills are learned, then all is well. Cultural humility 
dictates that in order to appropriately care for those of other cultures, more than just a skill set 
is required. For cultural humility, one must self evaluate his or her ideas and judgments on a 
regular basis and be open to learning from those who come to us – and keep on learning.  
 
QUESTION: What do you think of the concept of cultural humility? Do you have cultural humility?  
• Some aspects of culture may not be clearly obvious – some Latino s are indistinguishable 
from white people; some black americans may look, dress or act like they are from other 
3 
 parts of the world. We never really know, and it is actually impolite and rude to ask people 
about their background – depending upon the circums tance.  
 
QUESTION: How ready are you to accept any person as a fellow human who deserves respect no 
matter what they look or sound like??  
• Are you able to adjust or change your behavior and ideas?  
 QUESTION: Regardless of my background and family beliefs, can I al ter how I feel about, think 
about, and care for those who are very different than I am?  
 
What Are Some Ways We May Be Racist Without Being Aware? Microaggression 
(From Wikipedia )  
• Microaggression is the idea that some interactions between those of different races, cultures, 
or genders can be non-physical types of aggression.  
• This is a term coined by Chester M. Pierce in 1970.  
• Sue et al. (2007) noted that there are "brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or 
environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, 
derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults toward people who look different, are people of color or those who do not spea k the dominant language."  
Types of Microaggression  
• Questioning the existence of racial -cultural issues  
• Making stereotypic assumptions  
• Cultural insensitivity/naiveté/ignorance  
• Denial of ones personal biases (e.g., "I'm not homophobic; I even have gay f riends.")  
• Racial/Ageism/Sexism  
 
Racial Microaggression  
Commonplace are...  
• Being stopped in a car by police/for extra checking at an airport  
• Racial profiling of any sort  
• Being ignored by a waiter/waitress at a restaurant  
• Being assigned to a particula rly arduous/demeaning task by an employer  
• Waiting longer at a doctor’s office  
• Being treated as stupid by a healthcare provider or anyone else  
• Acting like one is Colorblind (e.g., "I don't think of you as Black. You are just a normal 
person.”)  
• Minimization of racial -cultural issues (e.g., "Just because you feel alone in this group doesn't 
mean that there's a racial issue involved.")  
 EXAMPLE OF A RACIAL MICROAGRESSION: I was playing golf with a friend named 
Enrique, who is a black man. A white man came over and introduced himself to us. Enrique 
introduced himself. The white man said: “How can you be black and be named Enrique?”  
Discussion: The white man revealed his i gnorance about many things in the above short exchange – 
for one, he knows little about people from different parts of the world. Enrique is Panamanian and is also black. And the white man has absolutely no clue that it is very rude to say such a thing to 
4 
 someone. We must learn to keep our mouths shut when it comes to our curiosity about people such as 
Enrique, who may not fit our stereotypes .  
 
QUESTION: As you read over the section on microaggression, did you uncover any of your own 
microaggression tenden cies?? Be honest. The more aware you are of such tendencies, the more likely 
you will be to make alterations in your ideas and behaviors. Remember, people can easily pick up on 
your biases.  
QUESTION: Can you think of any examples of microaggression you ha ve witnessed or participated 
in?  
 
OUR OWN CULTURE - THE PROVIDER  
In order to better understand those of other cultures, we must first recognize that we, as providers of 
health care, belong to a culture ourselves. Almost all health care professionals in t his country are or 
have become Western in their orientation about healthcare. This can create a cultural "clash" with 
patients or clients, since health care providers are part of a cultural group that has beliefs, practices, 
customs and rituals of its own.  
 This "culture" clash that may be found between physician and client/patient includes:  
 
• Definitions of health and illness  
• Procedures and technology  
• Preventive healthcare  
• Compliance/adherence  
• Approaches to health and well -being  
• Believing that illnes s is an external force  
• Believing that disease is either physical or mental  
 
Health care providers engage in rituals of:  
• Professionalism and courtesy  
• Physical exam  
• Sometimes asking a patient to disrobe  
• Touching  
• Procedures  
• Technology  
• Communication using medical terminology  
 
QUESTION: Were you aware of your own healthcare provider culture? As you consider your own 
culture, does it make sense to you that you belong to a culture of providers?  
 
Guidelines for Healthcare Professionals –  What We Need To Know  
How Patients  Find  Doctors: IN THE U.S.  
 
• In western medicine trust is vested in physicians based largely on credentials and education. In private practices, we expect to see a doctor’s educational and professional credentials 
displayed where we can view them.  
5 
 • In choosing a primary care physician at an HMO, we want to read about the credentials of 
physicians on the organization’s website before we choose our primary doctor. We may even 
respond with greater confidence if we deem a physician’s alma mater to be an esteemed 
medical institution.  
• If we  have the benefit of a recommendation from someone we know, even better, but often 
that isn’t available. The initial consultation with a doctor provides the first opportunity we 
have to find out for ourselves how comfortable and confident we feel with the person’s 
expertise and bedside manner.  
• We want an expert’s opinion more than a connection, so we accept a bedside manner that may be less warm but is highly professional. For some people, the crowded schedules of 
esteemed specialists are actually reassuri ng – proof of sorts that we are lucky to be the patient 
of such a highly sought -after doctor.  
 
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD  
• In many cultures of the world, trust is vested in health care professionals based on referrals 
from very well -trusted sources – usu ally close friends or family members.  
• People in more collectivist cultures expect to establish a longer -term relationship with a 
doctor, especially their personal physician.  
• At one time, this was more common in this country too; small town family doctors  cared for 
several generations of families in their practices.  
• The relatively impersonal way we now seek out primary care providers and specialists is very 
difficult for people unaccustomed to our health care system in the U.S.  
• The likelihood of establis hing warm personal rapport is far less certain with a complete 
stranger who is often short on time.  
 
Collectivist vs. Individualist Cultures  
• In a highly individualistic culture, like American culture, it is common for people to believe 
the locus of control in their lives rests securely with themselves. They are not comfortable 
unless they feel a sense of control, and nothing signals this more than having a voice and 
being heard.  
• In collectivist cultures, and in societies where a high power distance is th e norm, patients are 
more likely to view providers as authority figures who conduct themselves with utter 
certainty. A warm and paternalistic rapport is established between patients and physicians, 
but at the same time, patients may expect to be told what to do.  
 
Some cultures have high power distance –  this means people adhere to their 
proscribed place on the social ladder.  
• Being asked, “What do you believe has caused your illness?” suggests to a patient that their 
opinion is equal to the doctor’s. This is impossible in many cultures.  
• In many countries, people visit a doctor or traditional healer expecting to be cured on the spot 
or to be given a medicine that will cure them after they leave. There is no experience with 
waiting for test results, no understanding of chronic disease, prev entive medicine, or self -
care.  
• Being told that the diagnosis is inconclusive may be met with suspicion, mistrust, and 
frustration.  
• Getting second opinions is also related to the dimension of culture called power distance. In 
many cultures it is not alrig ht to “go behind a doctor’s back.”  
6 
 • Patients/families from cultures that respect physicians as authority figures, and who tend to 
be high context communicators focused on preserving harmony, will be far less likely to admit wanting a second opinion.  
• They may experience such discomfort over discussing this with their physician that they 
avoid the conversation entirely.  
• The culturally responsive physician anticipates this scenario and is proactive.  
 
What You Can Do:  
Though time is definitely a finite reso urce in American medical culture, even the busiest health care 
professionals can do the following:  
• Slow down just a little bit and offer a few words of friendly conversation before getting to the 
medical issue at hand.  
• Ask about the family’s well-being, which is a question of great significance in collectivist cultures.  
• Offer a handshake that lingers a moment and is less business -like than an American 
professional handshake.  
• Be aware that patients from more traditional cultures may hold expectations for establishing a friendly warm rapport with American healthcare providers.  
• Patients may react with confusion and even consternation at the collaborative approach of patient -centered care.  
• Effective cross -cultural communication begins with understanding va lues-based health 
beliefs and behaviors – including the expectations different cultures have for physicians.  
• Understand that trust is not vested in medical professionals the same in all cultures.  
• It is helpful to be prepared for what may appear to be a c ontradiction of values and 
expectations operating in some cross -cultural interactions.  
• Know that even though at times challenging and more time -consuming, a culturally 
responsive approach to patient care results in clearer expectations, better compliance, reduced medical errors and improved patient satisfaction.  
• Cultural responsiveness in health care describes the capacity to respond to the health care issues of diverse communities.  
 
Another Suggestion:  
World Travelers Customs & Cultures iPhone app Deve loped by Hooked in Motion, LLC.  
This app, though designed for use by travelers, might be a useful culture -specific information tool in 
other cross -cultural situations as well.  
• It offers general information for over 165 countries on greetings, communicati on styles, 
personal space and touching, eye contact, views on time, gender issues, gestures, taboos, law 
and order.  
• If you look up Mexico -Greetings, you get a rundown of how men usually greet men, women 
greet women, and how men and women greet one another.  
• Under Communication Styles it says that Mexicans tend to favor an indirect communication 
style.  
• The North of Mexico is very different from the South. In northern states people are louder and more direct.  
• In the mountain and rural areas of the South people are soft spoken and quieter.  
7 
 • In rural areas direct eye contact is not always acceptable, thoug h in cities it is widely 
acceptable.  
• In communication between children and adults, if a child is in trouble, he should not look the 
adult directly in the eye as this is considered disrespectful and challenging.  
 
This kind of information could be useful a s a quick reference guide before an office visit with a 
patient/family from another country. If the information is used to suggest possible differences in 
communication styles between cultures, then yes. Being aware, for example, that some cultures 
prefer indirect communication and may avoid sustained eye contact is important. This fact might help 
make sense of how a patient/family member is behaving during an office visit. As always, the 
information can’t be applied too rigidly, but may provide guidance.  
 
Guidelines for reaching out to the diverse populations in your area  
Utilizing Businesses Around You Operated b y Those from Other Cultures  
1. Find out what restaurants, hair and nail salons, etc. are in your area that are owned and/or visited 
by the vari ous cultures in your area.  
2. Visit these establishments. Make appointments/reservations. Utilize their services.  
3. First, get to know more about the countries/history/customs, etc.  
4. We must explain chiropractic in ways that are easily understandable  – emphasize the natural 
aspects of chiropractic. Many can relate to that since many come from places where natural 
healthcare is utilized; make sure you have charts around.  
5. Keep things simple – It is not helpful to complicate things.  
6. Include pictures of non- whites in your office to create a welcoming  office environment.  
7. Work to interpret language problems or issues with translation.  
8. Understand history of why they left their country. Most people do not leave their country unless 
there is an  economic reason to do so.  
9. Do you know any community leaders, traditional healers or patients who might take you to where 
they are/teach you?  
 
“As clinicians, we need to ‘check our own pulse’ and become aware of personal attitudes, beliefs, 
biases, and behaviors that may influence (consciously or unconsciously) our care of patients as well as our interactions with professional colleagues and staff from diverse racial, ethnic, and 
sociocultural backgrounds.” —  Robert C. Like, MD, MS, UMDNJ -Robert Wood J ohnson Medical 
School  
 
NOTE : The degree of exposure to western and/or American culture greatly affects an individual’s 
attitudes and behaviors. Religious affiliations are also extremely influential. While it is useful to 
apply generalizations when learning about cultures, it is also important to avoid applying hard and 
fast rules in any cross -cultural interaction.  
 
African Americans/Blacks  
 “Frequently, due to issues of stigma and lack of access Blacks are seen in crisis and, hence, in the 
acute care settings. This may explain why adult Blacks are 20% more likely to be reported as having 
serious psychological distress than adult Whites. They  are also more likely to have feelings of 
sadness, helplessness and worthlessness compared to adult Whites.”  
8 
  “Working with African American/Black Patients”; Rahn K. Bailey, M.D. American Psychiatric 
Association website, 2019. 
The 2017 US Census Bureau est imated 47,411,470 African Americans  in the  United States  meaning 
that 14.6% of the total American population of 325.7 Million is Black . This includes those who 
identify as ‘Black Only’ and as ‘Black in combination with another race’. The ‘ Black Only’ 
category by itself totaled 43.5 million African Americans  or 13.4%  of the total population.  
2017 Black Population: 47.4 million, 14.6% of USA; Black Demographics website; 2019   
 
African -American vs. black  
“The term African -American was advanced in  the 1980s to give Americans of African descent an 
equivalent of German -American , Italian-American , and so on. The term peaked in popularity during 
the 1990s and 2000s, but today it is often perceived as carrying a self -conscious political correctness 
that is unnecessary in informal contexts. In informal speech and writing, black is often preferred and 
is rarely considered offensive. Colored, an old term for African American people, is now considered offensive, and Negro has fallen out of favor among younge r black Americans.”  
From: The Grammarist  
 
NOTE: Some of the following ideas are from Marcia Cateret, M.Ed.’s blog: Dimensions in 
Cross-Cultural Communication .  
 
Understanding the Black Population  
• Some have come here recently – there is a big difference between those who have been 
here for generations and those who have come more recently – the culture will be 
different, dress might be different.  
• If a black person is educated and well -dressed, then there might be somewhat less 
racism or obvious racism that person may encounter. This comes from an interview with a number of black attorneys/professionals I know, who tell me this is the case.  
• Faith and religious ideas are important to know about – bec ause that will determine 
their beliefs regarding health matters.  
• Black women are often more educated.  
• Matriarchal – In general, the black community tends to be more matriarchal.  
• The diet tends to be less nutritional and of higher caloric value, which le ads to obesity. 
Some of this has to do with limited access to fresh foods.  
• Those financially better off may move away from the more traditional ideas.  
• Less permissive child rearing  
• Older generation more conservative  
• Elders tend to be respected.

Special Considerations when working with Black/African American Patients...  
“Black or African American” refers to people having origins in any of the Black racial groups of 
Africa. It includes people who indicated their race or races as “Black, African American, or Negro,” 
9 
 or wrote in entries such as African American, Afro American, Nigerian, or Haitian. Thus, it is 
important to consider that the Africa n American population itself is diverse and includes immigrants 
from Nigeria, Ethiopia, South Africa, the West Indies, Central America and the Caribbean. AND 
African Americans have a complex history in the U.S., hence there is not a single shared culture.  
 
African Americans suffer from some distinct health disparities.  
• a higher incidence of hypertension, sickle cell anemia, and diabetes  
• a higher combined overweight and obesity rate; 65% of African-American men and 56.5% of 
African -American women are over weight or obese, compared with 61% of white men and 
49.2% of white women  
• far higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality for both men and women  
• substantially higher prevalence of diabetes, with double the incidence of complications such 
as low er-limb amputations and end-stage renal disease  
• a cancer death rate about 35% higher  
• more rapid progression of certain diseases, including prostate and breast cancer  
 Communication  
• Non-verbal  
o Personal space needs can be hard to determine. You can atte mpt to judge this yourself 
by watching for cues from the patient or you can simply ask the patient what is too far /too close or most comfortable for them. This helps avoid feelings that you are “in 
{their} face” or “far away because I am black.”  
o Patient may be reluctant to make eye contact. Do not force it, hence making them 
uncomfortable. They may have been taught that it is not polite to look people in the eye. Do not interpret this as rude.  
• Verbal  
o Ask patient to self -identify race to determine prefer ence for Black/African American/ 
Negro/etc. This way, instead of guessing and possibly getting it wrong, you can be more certain as to how they wish to be addressed.  
o Refer to patient as Mrs., Mr., Ms. or Miss unless requested to use first name or other 
name OR you can simply ask how they wish to be addressed (This could be much 
simpler.)  
o To African American women in the northern parts of the U.S., use of the term “Ms.” 
may be offensive. Be certain to ask the patient how she prefers to be addressed.  
 
• Special Considerations  
o Watch prejudice/discrimination.  
o Avoid use of “loaded” words like “boy,”  \ “gal,” or “you people.”  
o Use respectful terms, such as “person,” “man,” “woman,” “gentleman,” or “lady.”  
o Be aware that your patient may be sensitive to pe rceived disrespect based on race.  
o Do not make assumptions about beliefs, such as use of alternative medicines or 
“voodoo.”  
 
10 
 • Planning Treatment  
o Family structures vary in the African American culture.  
o Religious beliefs vary in the African American culture.  
o Ask patients to identify whom to include in their treatment plan.  
o Particularly in the South, patients may believe in “high” blood (caus ed by overly rich food) 
or “low” blood (anemia), conditions caused by diet.  
o These conditions are often treated with folk remedies, such as consuming white foods, 
vinegar, herbal remedies, or laxatives.  
 
Many low- income blacks traditionally separate illness into two categories:  
1. Natural illness occurs as a result of God’s will or when a person comes into unhealthy contact 
with the forces of nature, such as exposure to cold or impurities in the air, food, or water. Natural 
illness can also occur as a p unishment for sins. Cures for natural illness include an antidote or other 
logical protective actions.  
 
2. Unnatural illness, on the other hand, is considered the result of evil influences that alter God’s intended plan. These illnesses are often founded on a belief in witchcraft, in which individuals who 
exist possess power to mobilize the forces of good and evil.  
• The use of voodoo healers among Haitians and other West Indian blacks is an example. 
Treatment or cures for unnatural illness can be found in religion, magic, amulets, and herbs. Many of these beliefs are African in origin, and aspects of them may be seen among African 
Americans of all backgrounds.  
• Ethiopians and Eritreans generally prefer that the family, rather than the patient, be informed of a terminal illness. They have a strong belief in destiny and God’s power to influence 
events, especially health events.  
 Among many West Indian and Central American blacks, communication about an upcoming death or 
communication with the dead may often be revealed through dreams. Attempts at spiritual healing 
may be concealed from providers to avoid the stigma attached to such practices, which may be 
labeled as devil worshipping or mumbo-jumbo by mainstream European-American culture. When 
such medical or health -related information is revealed, providers should place it in its proper cultural 
context. Insofar as possible, the physician should work with the patient to accommodate personal 
beliefs into any treatment plan.  
 
BRIDGING THE GAP:  
You can bridge the gap between you and people of various backgrounds who come to you in any 
number of ways. You can make it a personal goal to treat all who come to you as equal. Know their 
name, things about them, their country, etc. I did. It can make a huge difference in their trusting you, 
sticking with you long enough to get better and to refer to you when someone they know needs the type of care you provide. AND it can make practicing fun! When you have succeeded, it is a 
wonderful feeling.  
 
A personal example of bridging the gap - between myself (a white female chiropractor) and an 
African man.  
A new black patient of mine  arrived at my office for an appointment. His last name was Sirleaf. I am 
very interested in what is happening in the world and knew that the president of Liberia  was El len 
Johnson Sirleaf. I asked my patient if he was Liberian. He was very surprised. I then asked how his 
new president Mrs. Sirleaf was doing. Now he was actually shocked! He told me “SHE IS MY 
11 
 COUSI N!!!” I told him I had seen a film about her first year in office, entitled “Iron Lady.” From 
then on we had a totally different relationship, born from a personal connection.  
QUESTION : Are you now more aware of the how, where, why and when of interacting  with the 
African American/Black community around your practice?  
QUESTION: Are there any specific things you just learned that you might utilize with your 
patients???  
QUESTION: Do you see how learning about the history of the countries of the various people who 
live near you can be incredibly valuable?

ASIANS  
 
“Buddhism:  While there are as as many religions  in Asia as there are anywhere else, Buddhism  
is one of the predominant ones. Buddhism was established in northern India  about 2500 years 
ago in response to the life and teachings of Gautama Siddhartha who was given the title  
"Buddha" or " awakened -one."  
Asian Culture and Traditions; Kidzworld.com website; Feb 01, 2019  
Eastern Culture  
“Eastern world refers to countries in Asia and Middle East. The people in eastern countries are 
more traditional than people in the West when we consider their rituals, customs, clothing, etc. For 
example, Indians pay respect to their elders by touching the ir feet; East Asians use bows as 
greetings, apologizing and thanking. People in the East are rigid in their ideologies and beliefs; they are often reluctant to challenge and question the long practiced traditions and customs .”

Asians are the fastest -growing minority  
• Asians and Pacific Islanders are the fastest growing ethnic minorities in the United States, 
and number more than 17 million in the 2010 census.  
• This heterogeneous population is from many cultures and speaks many languages — there are 
many distinct Asian ethnic groups.

Palauan  
Tahitian  
Tongan  
 NOTE: We will focus on cultures more populous in the United States: East Asian (China, Japan, 
Korea) and Southeast Asian (Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand).  
 
When Did Asians First Come to the U.S.?  
• Filipino sailors were the first to settle in the U.S. around 1750 in what would later be 
Louisiana.  
• Around 1840, to make up for the shortage of slaves from Africa, the British and Spanish brought over slaves or "coolies" from China, India, and the Philipp ines to islands in the 
Caribbean, Peru, Ecuador, and other countries in South America.  
• The first large -scale immigration of Asians into the U.S. didn't happen until 1848 when gold 
was discovered in California.  
• Most of these early Chinese workers were from the Guangdong (also called Canton) province in China.  
• Many Chinese also came as contract laborers to Hawaii to work in sugarcane plantations.  
 DISEASES THAT ARE MORE COMMON IN ASIANS  
(Source: Cleveland Clinic website)  
• Lactose intolerance  
 
Lactose in tolerance is found in as many as 75% to 100% of Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans.  
14 
 Hepatitis B  
Hepatitis B is much more common in Asians than in the general U.S. population, occurring in about 
8% to 22% of Asians vs. only 0.2% to 0.9% in the U.S. population. Consequently, primary 
hepatocellular cancer among Asians is not as rare as in the U.S. general population.  
 
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma  
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is rare in the general U.S. population but is remarkably common in  
Cantonese Chinese, presuma bly because of a high incidence of Epstein-Barr virus infectionin the 
region.   
Tuberculosis  
Tuberculosis is more common in Asian Americans than in other ethnic groups. Most cases in 
foreign -born Asians develop within the first 2 years after arrival in th e United States.  
 
General Health Information About Asians:  
• In traditional Chinese culture, if a person feels well, there is no need to see a doctor.  
• Blood is considered nonrenewable vital energy, so patients may resist having blood tests to 
check such things as cholesterol and glucose levels.  
• Toxicity or side effects of ginseng such as central nervous system stimulation and increased blood pressure ha ve been reported. Excessive amounts of ginseng may cause headache, 
insomnia, and palpitations. Ginseng may decrease the diuretic effect of furosemide, causing an adverse reaction in patients with congestive heart failure. Fourteen percent of U.S. Asian families live below the poverty line, compared with 11.5% of Caucasian families.  
 
Asians Tend to Value the Collective and Have Strong Family Values  
NOTE: The degree to which U.S. cultural values have been adopted has a dramatic impact on whether these values and any associated behaviors apply to a given individual.  
• Asians tend to be highly group-oriented people who place a strong emphasis on family 
connection as the major source of identity and protection against the hardships of life. The 
family model is a n extended one including immediate family and relatives, and loyalty to the 
family is expected.  
• Independent behavior that may disrupt the harmony of the family is highly discouraged. One 
must never bring dishonor or disgrace to one’s self or the family.  
• In the traditional Asian family, parents define the law and the children are expected to abide 
by their requests and demands; respect for one’s parents and elders is critical.  
• In the most traditional of families there are specific rules of conduct such as : only speak 
when spoken to, speak only if one has something important to say.  
• Self-control is expected and individuals should demonstrate inner stamina and strength to 
tolerate crisis.  
• In healthcare settings, Asians may be unwilling to acknowledge strong emotion, grief, or pain due to their family and cultural values. Western medical professionals often find the stoic demeanor of Asian people difficult to interpret.  
 
 
 
15 
 Asian Communication  
• Asians are high context communicators. This means that gesture, body language, eye contact, 
pitch, intonation, word stress, and the use of silence are as important as the actual words 
being spoken.  
• An intentional lack of directness in conversation is favored by people from many Asian cultures because preserving harmon y between people is often more important than getting at 
the exact “truth.”  
• Asians are typically polite in social encounters whereas Americans, being very low context 
communicators, are comfortable with very direct questions and answers and often seem 
abrupt to people from high context cultures. This is important to keep in mind when 
communicating with Asian people, especially those who are relatively new to the United 
States.  
• Asian people may be “tuned” to the moods of others during conversation, and cul turally they 
expect others to be similarly sensitive.  
• Asians may expect doctors to sort out their concerns, confusion, and hesitance within the 
context of polite conversation, while western doctors mistake head-nodding, smiles, and 
verbal assent as clear indication of understanding and agreement when the opposite is in fact 
true.  
• Particularly enigmatic to Americans is the Asian tendency to smile when confused or 
embarrassed. Smiling does not necessarily indicate pleasure or humor in all cultures. When 
dealing with Asian children in particular, it is important to make careful observations and ask 
clarifying questions. 
 
Asian Cultures and the Concept of Time  
Some Asian cultures have a more relaxed attitude towards time than is typical of Americans. 
Attitudes towards time vary a great deal person to person, and cultural differences with regards to 
time serve only as a touch point of consideration when dealing w ith patients/families.  
• Asians have a polychronic time framework which means that different social interactions can occur at the same time. This is similar to multi- tasking but on a social level.  
• This is very different form the Western monochronic time which demands a linear scheduling of events one at a time. Some Asian parents may arrive late for appointments without 
offering an apology because they are simply not aware of the linear scheduling of doctors’ 
time.  
• Similarly, some Asians, such as the Hmong , don’t believe in pushing hard to get things done 
and appear hasty as a result. Rather, they believe that events run their own course.  
• The Japanese tend to be highly punctual.  
• The Vietnamese use what translates roughly as “rubber time” – if you expect people to come to an appointment or meeting at 8:00 am, you should invite them for 7:30 am.  
 
Asian Cultures and the Acceptance of Uncertainty  
Human beings display a variety of cultural attitudes about controlling external forces, attitudes about time, destiny and fate can vary dramatically different between people.  
In U.S. American culture, we struggle with simply accepting things as they are, which creates high levels of stress and anxiety in our lives. Our inner urge to be busy is directly related to our 
need to control life’s uncertainty and feelings of powerlessness toward external forces.  
16 
 We focus on the individual as the locus of control in decision making and put little faith in fate or 
karma.  
• Many Asian people, by comparison, have a strong belief that uncertainty is inherent in life and each day is taken as it comes. This mindset manifests in health beliefs and behaviors in significant ways. A fatalistic attitude about sickness may make Asian patients/families seem 
resigned to their situation.  
• Talking in terms of beating a disease will not resonate with those who embrace an attitude of 
acceptance.  
• U.S. healthcare professionals will ben efit from keeping this cultural difference in mind when 
dealing with Asian patients/families.  
• Acceptance of what life brings does not indicate an unwillingness to cooperate with doctors 
and treatment, but rather a belief that fighting illness is a negativ e approach to healing. 
 
QUESTION: Do you now have a better idea of how to welcome Asians into your practice?  
QUESTION: Do you have specific ideas for how to behave in ways that Asians will be able to 
accept?  
 
MIDDLE EASTERNERS  
MIDDLE EAST CENTER  
As you may know, not all Muslims are Arabs, and not all Arabs are Muslim (the Arab world has 
important Christian, Jewish, and other religious minorities). The guidelines suggested here are therefore 
general and are helpful for treating most patients of Middle Eastern origin. It is important to remember the 
language needs of your patients. While many Arabs speak English well, this will not be equally true 
across categories of class and gender.  
 
Privacy & Sex Segregation  
 
“Modesty is a major concern for Arab and/or Muslim women. Gender mixing among patients is an unnecessary stress for Muslim patients. In addition, male practitioners are generally preferred by male patients; female practitioners are sometimes r equired for female patients (especially in 
gynecological matters).”  
 “Arab and Muslim Patients in Your Medical Practice: A Guide for Medical Professionals; University of Pennsylvania  School of Arts and Sciences  website; 2019.  
 
Who Are Middle Easterners?  
In contemporary usage, the Middle East encompasses a region spanning from Rabat (Morocco) to 
Tehran (Iran), a distance of roughly 3,400 miles.

To better understand immigrants from the Middle East and their descendants, let us focus on Arab 
Americans, who make up more than half of this population.  
18 
 • Arab Americans are defined as those who immigrated from or are descendants of immigrants 
who came from the predominantly Arabic -speaking nations in Southwest Asia and North 
Africa.  
• The first wave of Arab American immigrants came from the Ottoman Empire in  the 1880s.  
• The vast majority of the early Arab immigrants were Christian.  
• Armenians who survived the genocide in 1915 arrived in the U.S. after World War I. While Armenians are not considered Arab Americans, they share many cultural traits with Arab 
Ame ricans or other Middle Eastern groups, depending on their country of origin (mostly Iran 
and Turkey).  
• Single women (widows, unmarried sisters) were a sizable proportion of this group. Many of 
these immigrants became peddlers and traveled the U.S. selling silk, buttons, jewelry, household items, and religious articles from the Holy Land.  
• A small number of Muslim Arab immigrants arrived in America to escape the military draft after the Young Turks took over the Ottoman Empire.  
• Ross, a small town in North D akota, is said to have been the first Muslim community in 
America. After Henry Ford offered $5 a day for work in his automobile factories, both Middle Eastern Christian and Muslim immigrants came to Michigan.  
• The founders of Haggar and Farrah, leaders in the men’s clothing industry, were of Arab 
descent.  
 
Health Problems of Middle Easterners –  the more common ones  
Beta Thalassemia  Sickle cell anemia  
Cystic fibrosis  
Fragile x syndrome  
 
Understanding Middle Eastern Patients & Families  
Culturally driven attitudes and behaviors often create communication challenges between Middle 
Eastern patients and Western health care professionals.  
 Middle Easterners approach life differently in signif icant ways from Westerners:  
• Time  
 
o Punctuality is less important in the Middle East than in the United States.  
o A patient might be late for an appointment, or not come at all, because another matter 
immediately at hand was seen as more important than the previously scheduled appointment.  
o The matter taking precedence often involves meeting the needs of someone a person feels 
obligated to in a reciprocal relationship – i.e. a family member or close friend.  
o Americans, being task- oriented, plan their  days around getting things accomplished and 
are annoyed by a nonchalant approach to time.  
o Americans who are left waiting for more than a few minutes may feel they are being 
disrespected; the late arriver should offer a good explanation for not showing up on time.  
o Middle Easterners on the other hand may be offended by the Americans attention to 
getting things done rather than taking the time to establish a relationship.  
 
19 
 • Power distance – strength of social hierarchy  
 
Less dominant persons must at all costs placate stronger ones. This is important to consider in the 
face of power distance in healthcare situations, especially between male doctors and their patients. 
Because the authority of a physician is never questioned, a Middle Easterner is not likely to ask 
questions or give information that would contradict or show disrespect.  
 
• Male/fema le roles  
 
o Depending on the degree of acculturation in the U.S., religious views, etc., a Middle 
Eastern person, especially a male, may feel uncomfortable interacting with a female 
doctor as a person of real authority.  
o Sexual segregation is usually extrem ely important.  
o Assign same -sex caregivers whenever possible.  
o Maintain a woman’s modesty at all time.  
o Women may defer to husbands for decision -making regarding their own and their 
children’s health. This is not necessarily a sign of extreme dominance on the part of the male; the female may very well prefer this culturally -based dynamic.  
o Husbands may answer questions addressed to the wife.  
o Direct eye contact with members of the opposite sex may be interpreted as a sign of sexual interest particularly fro m female to male. Personal problems are usually taken 
care of within the family; they will probably not be receptive to counseling. Loud and 
expressive emotions are accepted, especially during childbirth, after someone has died, 
or when coping with pain.  
 
• Personal space/Touch  
 
o The appropriate conversational distance between Middle Easterners is twice as 
close as Americans are used to.  
o Middle Easterners touch more frequently.  
o This difference in personal conversing space can make Westerns feel very 
uncomfortable. The collapsing of personal space may feel invasive or even somewhat 
aggressive.  
 
• One’s Word  
 
o Many Middle Eastern communities have a strong honor ethic, considering 
someone's word as serious.  
o Therefore, you should never orally promise something you cannot deliver.  
 
• Privacy  
 
o Those from the Middle East have personal space bubbles that are much smaller.  
o Gestures which would be used to convey anger or upset are not used in the same 
way in the Middle East.  
o Therefore, it can help to listen to someone's tone of voice, and to be careful about 
your own body language.  
20 
  
• Evil Eye  
 
o The belief that if someone is jealous of you, your children or of what you have, 
they may harm you, etc.  
o Or if they covet things about you, they may also harm you.  
 
Middle Easterners as patients :  
o People from the Middle East may tend to resist disclosing detailed personal 
information to strangers, including healthcare professionals.  
o Data for health histories may not be willingly given and request for information may be viewed with some suspicion until it is clear why the questions are being asked.  
o Middle Easterners desire to please or to appear good.  
o Also, medication is heavily used. Middle Eastern patients may expect to receive a 
prescription. Middle Easterners often fear hospital admission because hospitals are 
considered places of misfortune where people go to die.  
o It takes more time to consult with a Middle Eastern family, and that scheduling 
should be arranged accordingly when possible.  
o Preventive care is not practiced as commonly in the Middle East as it is in the United 
States.  
o Much like Latino and Asian people, Middle Easterners believe in the importance of balancing “hot” and “cold” foods – qualities that do not necessarily have to do with 
actual food temperature. They avoid eating incompatible foods at the same meal.  
o Health professionals have frequently observed among Middle Easterners a fatalistic 
acceptance of disease or death –  it’s all in Allah’s hands.  
o Strong need for affiliat ion.  
o Thrive on a large network of relationships.  
o During illness or crisis, they rely heavily on other persons in their “in-group” instead of trying to cope more individually as many Americans would typically do.  
o A person seeking medical care may be acco mpanied by one or more persons in 
Middle Eastern culture who expect to be present during the examination or interview, who listen carefully and often answer for the patient.  
o Usually it is an elderly person who will feel offended if not invited into the 
physician’s office.  
o People close to the patient consider themselves duty bound to be there.  
o The intense connection to family and close friends that is seen in many Middle 
Easterners is often accompanied by doubt about the intentions of those outside their 
intimate circle.  
o Thus, family members typically see it as their job to make sure that the patient gets 
the best care possible from medical professionals.  
o Repetition of demands is often made to show emphasis, as is a loud tone of voice.  
o Family and friends are expected never to leave a patient alone and to constantly 
shower care and attention.  
o A great deal of patience is sometimes needed in dealing with these “demanding” 
family members.  
o Negative information should be presented with great care. A common c ommunication 
practice in the Middle East is to reveal the news of a tragedy or a poor prognosis in 
stages. Bad news is often not given to the patient directly.  
21 
 o It is usually appropriate to speak first to the family spokesman.  
o The one with the most authority in any situation is usually the oldest and most 
educated person.  
 
(These do not apply to every individual. Ask questions of each patient/family to understand their own personal beliefs and behaviors.)  
 
Middle Easterners and Communication  
• Given the i ntensity and frequency of their relationships, Middle Easterners tend to be highly 
contextual communicators. This means that persons seek understanding of events by examining 
the context in which they occur.  
• A Middle Easterner needs to know more about ano ther person than an American does.  
• A person who is not overcome with emotion is not admired.   
 
QUESTION: Do you now have more of an idea how to understand and care for those from the 
Middle East , as well as Asians and Blacks? This course is a basic intro duction. If providers have an 
interest, there is much more information that can be found on the internet. It is also wise to learn 
about the past and current history of any group of patients who come to your office. This will help 
in understanding more abo ut your patient population.

• Experimental studies on animals are extremely 
valuable and yield important information on the mechanism of toxicity, but they cannot be extrapolated easily to human effects

• Experimental clinical toxicologic studies on human 
beings cannot be conducted at toxic doses and are of little help in assessing contribution to disease outcomes
• Anecdotal or descriptive studies of occupational or 
accidental toxicity in humans are very useful in defining possible health outcomes and give almost the only relevant human information available on toxicity thresholds for most toxic chemicals (supplements)

• However, they are usually incomplete in their 
documentation and only involve a small number of individuals, often without precise quantification of the exposure level associated with the outcome
• Because of these limitations, standard toxicologic 
methods are of little help in apportioning by cause despite their usefulness in other ways

• Quantitative risk assessment is a method used in 
environmental studies to estimate the possible risk associated with low levels of exposure to a particular hazard
• In theory, it is well suited for apportionment by 
cause, and calculations have been made for human health risks following exposure to many chemicals and physical hazards

extremely uncertain, and estimates of risk may vary by orders of magnitude

• Moreover, the risk estimates are derived from 
either epidemiologic data or (more often) data from experimental animal populations and are population risk estimates, not individual risk 
estimates

• In the future, technology may help refine 
individual apportionment by cause
• Biomarkers of personal susceptibility and 
of exposure may, separately and together, allow a more precise risk profile of an individual to be derived, even after the disease has occurred

•The correct interpretation of estimates derived from 
quantitative risk assessment is that these estimates 
describe the highest risk likely to occur in a population given a certain level of exposure, not the most likely outcome associated with a particular occupation in which an exposure might occur
• Thus, despite its apparent promise and its 
demonstrated utility in environmental policy, quantitative risk assessment is not very well suited to apportionment 
by cause

•This would allow one to apportion risk more 
accurately in a complex case
• However, no such tests have been validated 
for this purpose, nor are any available for general use at present
• It is probable that the complexity of the 
problem will defeat efforts to fully characterize risk using biomarkers

• Within the foreseeable future, biomarkers 
are likely to become available individually for selected risk factors
• They are not likely to become available any 
time soon as part of a coherent system that allows apportionment

Apportionment by Cause and Presumption
• Presumption is the assumption that a given 
disease is more likely than not due to a particular cause because the association between the disease and an occupation or exposure is consistently large enough to make it "more likely than not"

Apportionment by Cause and Presumption – cont’d
• Some diseases, such as silicosis, are 
never seen without an occupational association, and these diseases are easily dealt with by presumption
• Even in these cases, related impairment 
may be apportioned to non occupational cause such as smoking

Apportionment by Cause and Presumption – cont’d
•Others are not unique to occupational causes but 
occur more often in occupational settings and must 
be evaluated by epidemiology
• The relative risk favoring an association must 
exceed 2 for presumption to be supported by epidemiologic evidence because this corresponds to greater than even odds in favor of the risk factor and therefore satisfies the criterion of "more likely than not"

Apportionment by Cause and Presumption – cont’d
• A claim that meets this standard of 
presumption should, all other thing being equal, be accepted routinely
• There may be rebutable presumptions and 
reasons for evaluating individual cases, but the essential logic of presumption in that the association has already been demonstrated

Apportionment by Cause and Presumption – cont’d
• Rebutting the presumptions requires 
showing that the claimant is different in some important way from the majority of such cases
• The most frequently encountered grounds 
for rebuttal are that other exposures that are not occupational have contributed a substantially greater risk than the occupational exposure
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause and Presumption – cont’d
• The case for rebuttal is strongest when the 
occupational exposure was unusually weak (eg., of short duration or in a job classification where the level of exposure was relatively low) and the non occupational exposures were unusually strong

• A problem arises when both occupational 
and non occupational exposures are strong enough to contribute a significant risk, as in the case of occupational carbon monoxide exposure and smoking for coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction

• Then the most conservative policy would be to 
accept the presumption if the occupational exposure was substantial in absolute terms and would have been sufficient to cause the resulting disease
• A more flexible policy would be to apportion 
the relative contribution of the different risk factors and to determine which predominated
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause and Presumption – cont’d
• However, this would be challenged easily in 
the individual case because causal exposures add to risk and often interact in ways that cannot be separated
• Most WCBs and commissions have policies 
that preclude apportionment by cause in such situations and declare that only a substantial contribution must be demonstrated

• A "substantial” contribution for a risk factor 
that is subject to a presumption is hard to distinguish from a contribution sufficient to make the presumption
• For this reason, an exposure sufficient to 
make a presumption in the first place probably should be accepted in all cases, even when there are other risk factors

• Two criteria need to be met:
1.  Significant magnitude or risk associated 
with exposure
– studies with relative risk greater than 2
2.  Substantial exposure of individual, similar to those in epidemiologic studies

Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause and Presumption – cont’d
• Even if we can demonstrate the first point, 
the second can be hard to prove
• This is really an issue of attribution, where 
uncertainty is relatively minimal and the contribution is large enough to be sufficient
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause and Significant Contribution
•This raises another difficult problem, the 
definition of a significant or substantial contribution
• Presumption can be defined in terms of more 
likely than not, but significant or substantial implies 
that the contribution was (or could have been - in the individual case there is no certainty) necessary but not necessarily sufficient
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause and Significant Contribution – cont’d
•In terms more familiar in law, "but for" the 
additional risk conferred by the occupational exposure, the health outcome would never have happened
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause and Significant Contribution – cont’d
•In this sense, the terms significant and 
substantial take on new meaning compared 
with use of the terms in the context of presumption
• In the context of significant contribution, the 
effect of the exposure must be sufficient to have a demonstrable effect on the body but not necessarily enough to cause impairment in itself
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause and Significant Contribution – cont’d
• This subtle change in definition rather 
unexpectedly reopens the argument for toxicologic interpretations because it accepts a "significant contribution" to injury that may be subclinical or not easily detected or quantified in populations
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause and Significant Contribution – cont’d
Usually this is of little use in such situations, 
unless one is documenting interactions, but a purely toxicologic or clinical approach would be stronger evidence in this context than in cases where strict causation is the issue
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause and Significant Contribution – cont’d
• It would be sufficient to demonstrate that 
the effect of exposure could have tipped the balance into clinical disease by demonstrating that the effects of exposure are real and realistically large enough to affect the body adversely in the presence of greater injury contributed by some other risk factor

Apportionment by Cause – cont’d
Apportionment by Cause and Significant Contribution – cont’d
• Such evidence can be provided by clinical 
toxicology, and even by laboratory studies if they are highly germane, and can be related clearly to human effects
• In the absence of scientific data, the judgment 
of a clinician may be weighted more strongly in cases where "significant contribution" is an issue than in apportionment generally

•The clinical course of a disorder may vary, but 
deviations from the expected course are obvious 
to clinicians and may be the basis for an interpretation of substantial contribution
• Elements of a case may include when the 
disease started and whether it would be expected to start at that age or under those circumstances in most cases and whether the timing was associated 
with occupation

Example 1
•A young man with a cancer of the bowel working in 
an occupation associated with an increased risk of 
bowel cancer might have a case for substantial contribution, despite a dietary profile and family history consistent with a normal risk for bowel cancer later in life
• The argument may hinge on whether the worker 
would have developed the same degree of impairment without the additional occupational exposure

Example 2
• A coal miner exposed to high levels of dust

•Thus apportionment by cause in this situation 
reduces to the need to demonstrate substantial or 
significant contribution
• The acceptable standard of evidence for 
demonstrating this contribution necessarily relaxes and can be based on evidence that would not otherwise carry much weight in establishing causation or presumption, such as estimates based on the occupational history or by industrial hygiene consultants

• There is a problem in the logic of this approach
• It makes an artificial distinction between 
occupational and non occupational risk factors and treats the occupational exposure as the "straw that broke the camel's back" in all cases the last factor in the chain of causation
• In the presence of more than one risk factor, who 
is to say that the outcome would not have occurred 
"but for" the non occupational cause?
Copyright 2004 Cupon/Jahn All Rights ReservedApportionment – cont’d

Apportionment by Cause and Significant Contribution – cont’d
• The treatment of occupational exposures in this 
way is similar to the legal endeavor to separate intentional injury from contributory negligence so that damages resulting from an injury may be apportioned properly
• The idea is that intentional injury and negligence 
are different categories of behavior
– intentional injury violates a social norm
– negligence is free from willful intent to cause injury

Apportionment by Cause and Significant Contribution – cont’d
• The degree of injury due to different acts 
should not be apportioned strictly on the basis of contribution of each act because the acts differed in type and are not comparable
• It is, however, an extralegal social policy to 
punish or deter intentional injury, and therefore, this may outweigh comparative responsibility in egregious cases

Example
• Different contributors to an assault situation may 
have equal contributions according to current injury theory but under civil law
– one court has apportioned a disproportionate 
share of responsibility in an assault case to the person committing the assault, a significant but much less share to a landlord who allowed unsafe conditions to exist that permitted the assault, and a strictly nominal share to a third person whose negligent actions apparently negligently allowed the assault to happen

• Likewise, in workers' compensation, the 
idea that employers who permit occupational exposures must take a greater share of responsibility is attractive, but 
– What about the employer who is 
conscientious? 
– Is it fair to model apportionment by cause on 
the assumption of intentional injury?

•The resolution of this problem ultimately is a 
policy decision
• In many US states and in Canada, the policies 
of the WCBs and the legislation that sets these policies have made the decision that the public good requires that any substantial contribution means a presumption in cases where more than one risk factor casts

  Joint	
  laxity	
  does	
  not	
  indicate	
  shoulder	
  instability;	
  rather,	
  there	
  are	
  varying	
  degrees	
  of	
  laxity	
  in	
  the	
  normal	
  shoulder.1,2	
  When	
  a	
  patient	
  presents	
  with	
  glenohumeral	
  instability,	
  it	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  differentiate	
  normal	
  laxity	
  from	
  instability	
  clini-­‐cally	
  and	
  to	
  establish	
  the	
  primary	
  direction	
  of	
  instability.	
  Patients	
  should	
  be	
  separated	
  clinically	
  into	
  two	
  groups,	
  those	
  suffering	
  from	
  symptomatic	
  laxity	
  and	
  those	
  demonstrating	
  overt	
  instability	
  of	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint.	
  Furthermore,	
  de-­‐termining	
  the	
  positions	
  and	
  activity	
  in	
  which	
  clinical	
  instability	
  occurs	
  also	
  provides	
  useful	
  information	
  during	
  the	
  evaluation.	
  Athletes	
  experiencing	
  symptomatic	
  laxity	
  may	
  present	
  with	
  problems	
  stemming	
  from	
  repetitive	
  edge	
  loading,	
  traction	
  on	
  the	
  glenoid	
  labrum	
  or	
  biceps	
  labral	
  complex,	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  tendinitis,	
  or	
  dead	
  arm	
  symptoms	
  resulting	
  from	
  traction	
  on	
  the	
  brachial	
  plexus	
  as	
  the	
  lax	
  shoulder	
  subluxes	
  inferiorly	
  or	
  anteroinferiorly.	
  A	
  typical	
  example	
  of	
  symptomatic	
  laxity	
  is	
  the	
  football	
  lineman	
  who	
  develops	
  posterior	
  pain	
  and	
  labral	
  injuries	
  that	
  result	
  from	
  blocking	
  with	
  the	
  arms	
  forward-­‐flexed	
  and	
  elbows	
  locked	
  in	
  extension.	
  Additionally,	
  baseball	
  pitchers	
  are	
  particularly	
  susceptible	
  to	
  exacerbations	
  of	
  internal	
  impingement	
  from	
  symptomatic	
  laxity.	
  This	
  is	
  caused	
  by	
  tremendous	
  forces	
  incurred	
  by	
  the	
  soft	
  tissue	
  structures	
  sur-­‐rounding	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint	
  during	
  the	
  production	
  of	
  the	
  throwing	
  arc	
  with	
  the	
  humerus	
  abducted	
  and	
  externally	
  ro-­‐tated.	
  Repetitive	
  motions	
  such	
  as	
  these	
  stress	
  the	
  surrounding	
  soft	
  tissue	
  structures,	
  including	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  ligaments	
  and	
  supraspinatus	
  rotator	
  cuff	
  tendon.	
  The	
  resulting	
  microtrauma	
  and	
  tension	
  can	
  lead	
  to	
  refractory	
  tendinitis	
  and	
  poten-­‐tially	
  to	
  labral	
  injuries	
  caused	
  by	
  the	
  supraspi-­‐natus	
  tendon	
  becoming	
  impinged	
  between	
  the	
  humerus	
  and	
  glenoid.	
  Effec-­‐tively,	
  a	
  pathologic	
  cycle	
  develops	
  in	
  which	
  repetitive	
  stress	
  magnifies	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  laxity;	
  this	
  in	
  turn	
  contributes	
  to	
  internal	
  impingement.	
  In	
  contrast	
  to	
  symptomatic	
  laxity,	
  overt	
  instability	
  refers	
  to	
  problems	
  in	
  which	
  the	
  athlete	
  is	
  unable	
  to	
  contain	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  within	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa	
  and	
  it	
  clearly	
  dislocates,	
  leaving	
  the	
  athlete	
  in	
  a	
  fully	
  compromised	
  position,	
  vulnerable	
  to	
  more	
  serious	
  nerve,	
  bone,	
  or	
  joint	
  injuries,	
  until	
  the	
  shoulder	
  is	
  reduced.	
  The	
  focus	
  of	
  this	
  chapter	
  will	
  be	
  on	
  those	
  indi-­‐viduals	
  who	
  demonstrate	
  overt	
  anterior	
  or	
  anteroinferior	
  instability.	
  In	
  2001,

  Anterior

  Given	
  the

  and	
  the

  it	
  is	
  not	
  surprising	
  that

  average	
  age	
  of	
  patients	
  seen	
  for

  of	
  ante-­‐rior

  It

  our	
  belief	
  that	
  young	
  athletes	
  who	
  desire	
  to	
  return	
  to	
  their	
  sport	
  and	
  present	
  with	
  acute

  should	
  be	
  treated	
  surgically.	
  As

  continue	
  to

  options	
  and	
  prognoses	
  for	
  patients	
  with	
  anterior	
  glenohumeral	
  instability,	
  a	
  fundamental	
  understanding	
  of	
  the	
  anatomy	
  and	
  pathoanatomy	
  of	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint	
  is	
  absolutely	
  critical	
  to	
  the	
  diagnosis	
  and	
  surgical	
  treatment	
  of	
  overt	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability	
  in	
  the	
  athlete.	
  This	
  point	
  is	
  emphasized	
  by	
  the	
  field’s	
  departure	
  from	
  nonanatomic	
  techniques	
  of	
  stabiliza-­‐tion,	
  such	
  as	
  the	
  Bristow,	
  Putti-­‐Platt,	
  and	
  Magnuson-­‐Stack	
  procedures.	
  We	
  believe	
  that	
  the	
  most	
  effective	
  stabilization	
  techniques	
  focus	
  on	
  restoration	
  of	
  normal	
  glenohumeral	
  anatomy,	
  particularly	
  through	
  repair	
  and	
  proper	
  tensioning	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex.	
  Such	
  intervention	
  allows	
  not	
  only	
  for	
  stability,	
  but	
  some	
  tailoring	
  can	
  be	
  done	
  to	
  allow	
  for	
  the

  of

ANATOMY OF THE STABLE AND UNSTABLE SHOULDER The	
  human	
  shoulder	
  joint	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐1)	
  is	
  formed	
  by	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  and	
  glenoid	
  surface	
  of	
  the	
  scapula.	
  As	
  humans	
  devel-­‐oped	
  an	
  orthograde	
  posture,	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint	
  evolved	
  so	
  that	
  the	
  head	
  of	
  the	
  humerus	
  abuts	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa,	
  as	
  opposed	
  to	
  articulating	
  within.	
  Whereas	
  this	
  anatomic	
  relation	
  affords	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint	
  tremendous	
  flexibility	
  and	
  range	
  of	
  motion,	
  it	
  does	
  so	
  at	
  the	
  cost	
  of	
  biomechanical	
  stability.12	
  Unlike	
  other	
  joints,	
  the	
  articulating	
  surface	
  area	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  is	
  limited.	
  The	
  biomechanical	
  stability	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  is	
  reliant	
  on	
  two	
  types	
  of	
  anatomic	
  restraints,	
  dynamic	
  and	
  static,	
  which	
  work	
  cooperatively	
  to	
  maintain	
  gleno-­‐humeral	
  stability	
  by	
  generating	
  joint	
  compressive	
  forces	
  and	
  directing	
  the	
  net	
  force	
  through	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  into	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa.13	
  Static	
  stabilizers	
  are	
  unable	
  to	
  generate

  and	
  include	
  the	
  bony	
  structures	
  of	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  and	
  glenoid	
  fossa,	
  the	
  fibrous	
  glenoid	
  labrum,	
  and	
  several	
  capsuloligamentous	
  structures.14-­‐16	
  Static	
  mechanisms	
  of	
  stabilization	
  provide	
  the	
  greatest	
  contribution	
  to	
  glenohumeral	
  stability	
  at	
  the	
  extreme	
  ranges	
  of	
  motion,	
  because	
  they	
  remain	
  lax	
  through	
  the	
  mid-­‐range	
  of	
  motions13	
  and	
  become	
  taut	
  as	
  the	
  shoulder	
  approaches	
  its	
  normal	
  limits	
  of	
  motion.17	
  Dynamic	
  stabilizers	
  include	
  the	
  muscles	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  cuff,	
  the	
  deltoid	
  group,	
  pectoralis	
  major,	
  and	
  latissimus	
  dorsi,	
  and	
  are	
  therefore	
  a	
  critical	
  component	
  to	
  glenohumeral	
  stability.	
  Concavity	
  compression	
  is	
  a	
  force	
  that	
  acts	
  to	
  contain	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  in	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa	
  and	
  is	
  a	
  function	
  of	
  the	
  depth	
  of	
  the	
  articulating	
  fossa	
  (provided	
  by	
  the	
  glenoid	
  and	
  the	
  labrum)	
  and	
  forces	
  generated	
  by	
  the	
  surrounding	
  musculature	
  that	
  direct	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  into	
  the	
  glenoid.	
  In	
  addition	
  to	
  generat-­‐ing	
  compressive	
  forces,	
  dynamic	
  stabilizers	
  also	
  initiate	
  movement	
  that	
  leads	
  to	
  tightening	
  of	
  capsuloligamentous	
  struc-­‐tures.14,18-­‐20	
  The	
  glenoid	
  fossa	
  is	
  shaped	
  like	
  an	
  inverted	
  comma,	
  with	
  average	
  measurements	
  of	
  35	
  mm	
  vertically	
  and	
  25	
  mm	
  trans-­‐versely.21,22	
  Saha’s

  also	
  noted	
  an	
  average	
  of	
  7.4	
  degrees	
  of	
  glenoid	
  retroversion	
  in	
  75%	
  of	
  shoulders	
  and	
  2	
  to	
  10	
  degrees	
  of	
  anteroversion	
  in	
  the	
  remaining	
  25%	
  of	
  shoulders.	
  The	
  hemispherical	
  surface	
  of	
  the	
  humeral	
  head—radii	
  of	
  cur-­‐vature,	
  25	
  mm	
  vertically	
  and	
  22	
  mm	
  transversely12—is	
  designed	
  to	
  interact	
  with	
  the	
  shallow	
  concave	
  surface	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid	
  (2.5	
  mm	
  anteroposteriorly	
  and	
  9	
  mm	
  superoinferiorly)24	
  so	
  that	
  the	
  contact	
  surface	
  area	
  is	
  maximized.	
  Articular	
  interaction	
  is	
  enhanced	
  by	
  the	
  inclination	
  of	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  with	
  respect	
  to	
  the	
  shaft	
  and	
  the	
  retrotorsion.25	
  Saha22	
  has	
  separated	
  glenohumeral	
  joints	
  into	
  three	
  groups	
  based	
  on	
  the	
  radius	
  of	
  curvature	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa	
  and	
  radius	
  of	
  the	
  humeral	
  head.	
  Type	
  A	
  articulation	
  is	
  defined	
  by	
  a	
  humeral	
  head	
  radius	
  smaller	
  than	
  that	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid,	
  Type	
  B	
  joints	
  exhibit	
  similar	
  radii	
  for	
  the	
  two	
  surfaces,	
  and	
  type	
  C	
  articulation	
  has	
  a	
  larger	
  humeral	
  head	
  radius	
  than	
  glenoid	
  radius.	
  Interactions	
  between	
  a	
  humeral	
  head	
  and	
  glenoid	
  fossa	
  with	
  differences	
  in	
  radii	
  approaching	
  zero	
  (type	
  B)	
  are	
  inherently	
  the	
  most	
  stable	
  because	
  the	
  contact	
  surface	
  area	
  is	
  maximized.	
  However,	
  Soslowsky	
  and	
  colleagues26	
  have	
  claimed	
  that	
  in	
  88%	
  of	
  cases,	
  the	
  glenoid	
  and	
  humeral	
  head	
  exhibit	
  less	
  than	
  a	
  2-­‐mm	
  difference	
  in	
  radii,	
  suggesting	
  that	
  most	
  glenohumeral	
  joints	
  could	
  be	
  consid-­‐ered	
  type	
  B;	
  thus,	
  inequality	
  in	
  radii	
  of	
  curvature	
  fails	
  to	
  explain	
  most	
  anterior	
  instability	
  cases.	
  The	
  anatomic	
  neck	
  of	
  the	
  humerus	
  also	
  plays	
  a	
  crucial	
  role	
  in	
  glenohumeral	
  stability	
  because	
  it	
  serves	
  as	
  an	
  attachment	
  site	
  for	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  cap-­‐sule	
  and	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  ligaments	
  (see	
  later).	
  The	
  concept	
  of	
  osseous	
  adaptation	
  has	
  been	
  explored	
  and	
  documented	
  in	
  professional	
  baseball	
  pitchers27	
  and	
  profes-­‐sional	
  European	
  handball	
  players28;	
  it	
  was	
  found	
  that	
  the	
  dominant	
  arm	
  develops	
  significant	
  glenoid	
  retroversion	
  in	
  the	
  dominant	
  arm.	
  During	
  the	
  act	
  of	
  throwing,	
  with	
  the	
  humerus	
  in	
  90	
  degrees	
  abduction	
  and	
  external	
  rotation,	
  tre-­‐mendous	
  forces	
  are	
  applied	
  to	
  the	
  static	
  and	
  dynamic	
  stabilizers	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder.	
  Osseous	
  adaptation	
  is	
  the	
  concept	
  that	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa	
  adopts	
  a	
  modified	
  bony	
  conformation	
  to	
  accommodate	
  the	
  repetitive	
  stress	
  of	
  the	
  throwing	
  mo-­‐tion.	
  Thus,	
  anterior	
  stability	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  is	
  enhanced	
  through	
  the	
  increased	
  articular	
  surface	
  area	
  present	
  through-­‐out	
  the	
  throwing	
  arc.	
  The	
  glenoid	
  labrum	
  is	
  dense	
  fibrous	
  tissue	
  with	
  a	
  triangular	
  shape	
  that	
  encircles	
  the	
  glenoid	
  rim	
  and	
  attaches	
  directly	
  to	
  the	
  long	
  head	
  of	
  the	
  biceps	
  tendon	
  at	
  the	
  supraglenoid	
  tubercle	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐2).	
  The	
  labrum	
  contributes	
  greatly	
  to	
  gleno-­‐humeral	
  stability	
  by	
  deepening	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa,29	
  without	
  changing	
  the	
  curvature	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid.30	
  Lippitt	
  and	
  associ-­‐
ates31	
  have	
  demonstrated	
  the	
  labrum’s	
  contribution	
  to	
  stability	
  by	
  showing	
  that	
  its	
  resection	
  leads	
  to	
  a	
  20%	
  decrease	
  in	
  resistance	
  to	
  translation.	
  Furthermore,	
  the	
  labrum	
  increases	
  the	
  surface	
  area	
  in	
  contact	
  with	
  the	
  humeral	
  head,	
  and	
  serves	
  as	
  an	
  attachment	
  point	
  for	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  capsule	
  and	
  ligaments.	
  The	
  contribution	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  capsule	
  to	
  stability	
  depends	
  on	
  collagen	
  integrity,	
  attachment	
  sites	
  on	
  the	
  glenoid	
  and	
  humeral	
  head,	
  and	
  position	
  of	
  the	
  arm.	
  The	
  glenohumeral	
  capsule	
  consists	
  of	
  three	
  layers,15	
  is	
  less	
  than	
  5	
  mm	
  thick,32	
  and	
  shows	
  significant	
  individual	
  variation.	
  The	
  anterior	
  capsule	
  is	
  more	
  substantial	
  than	
  the	
  thin	
  posterior	
  capsule;	
  it	
  is	
  com-­‐posed	
  of	
  loose	
  areolar	
  connective	
  tissue33	
  and	
  predominantly	
  type	
  I	
  collagen.34	
  The	
  primary	
  role	
  of	
  the	
  capsule	
  in	
  gleno-­‐humeral	
  stabilization	
  is	
  to	
  maintain	
  negative	
  intra-­‐articular	
  pressure.	
  A	
  capsular	
  or	
  labral	
  defect,	
  such	
  as	
  is	
  the	
  case	
  in	
  a	
  Bankart	
  lesion	
  (see	
  later)	
  results	
  in	
  a	
  loss	
  of	
  the	
  negative	
  intra-­‐articular	
  pressure35	
  critical	
  to	
  the	
  maintenance	
  of	
  shoulder	
  stability	
  through	
  the	
  midranges	
  of	
  motion.	
  The	
  glenohumeral	
  ligaments	
  are	
  discrete	
  thickenings	
  of	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  capsule,	
  identifiable	
  grossly	
  and	
  histologically	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐3).	
  The	
  most	
  common	
  cause	
  of	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability	
  is	
  insufficiency	
  of	
  these	
  capsuloligamentous	
  structures.	
  A	
  thorough	
  understanding	
  of	
  the	
  anatomy,	
  histology,	
  and	
  biomechanics	
  of	
  these	
  structures	
  is	
  crucial	
  to	
  understanding	
  and	
  treating	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability.	
  Turkel	
  and	
  coworkers36	
  have	
  laid	
  the	
  groundwork	
  for	
  the	
  study	
  of	
  these	
  static	
  contri-­‐butions,	
  by	
  showing	
  that	
  in	
  0	
  degrees	
  of	
  abduction,	
  anterior	
  stability	
  is	
  maintained	
  by	
  the	
  subscapularis	
  tendon,	
  in	
  45	
  de-­‐grees	
  abduction	
  the	
  shoulder	
  is	
  stabilized	
  by	
  the	
  subscapularis	
  tendon,	
  middle	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament,	
  and	
  anterior	
  fibers	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament,	
  and	
  in	
  90	
  degrees	
  abduction	
  and	
  external	
  rotation	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  provides	
  stabilization.	
  The	
  superior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  has	
  been	
  identified	
  in	
  90%	
  to	
  97%	
  of	
  specimens	
  investigated.15,37,38	
  It	
  takes	
  its	
  origin	
  at	
  the	
  supraglenoid	
  tubercle,	
  just	
  anterior	
  to	
  the	
  insertion	
  of	
  the	
  long	
  head	
  of	
  the	
  biceps	
  tendon,	
  and	
  inserts	
  into	
  the	
  anat-­‐omic	
  neck	
  to	
  the	
  humerus	
  slightly	
  superior	
  to	
  the	
  lesser	
  tuberosity.	
  The	
  superior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  is	
  also	
  a	
  compo-­‐nent	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval39	
  (see	
  later).	
  The	
  ligament’s	
  size	
  and	
  integrity	
  vary	
  from	
  person	
  to	
  person	
  and	
  are	
  not	
  easily	
  visualized	
  arthroscopically.	
  The	
  superior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  contributes	
  little	
  to	
  anteroposterior	
  stability	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder;40	
  however,	
  it	
  acts	
  in	
  concert	
  with	
  the	
  coracohumeral	
  ligament	
  to	
  limit	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  translation41	
  with	
  the	
  arm	
  adducted	
  or	
  in	
  the	
  neutral	
  position.	
  The	
  coracohumeral	
  ligament	
  is	
  an	
  extracapsular	
  structure	
  that	
  courses	
  from	
  the	
  lateral	
  surface	
  of	
  the	
  coracoid	
  process	
  to	
  the	
  greater	
  and	
  lesser	
  tuberosities	
  straddling	
  the	
  bicipital	
  groove.	
  The	
  cora-­‐cohumeral	
  ligament	
  aids	
  the	
  superior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  in	
  limiting	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  translation.	
  Together,	
  these	
  two	
  ligaments	
  contribute	
  greatest	
  to	
  stability	
  when	
  the	
  arm	
  is	
  adducted	
  or	
  in	
  0	
  degrees	
  abduction.16	
  As	
  the	
  arm	
  is	
  ab-­‐ducted	
  to	
  90	
  degrees,	
  the	
  mechanical	
  contribution	
  of	
  these	
  ligaments	
  to	
  stability	
  decreases	
  progressively	
  to	
  zero,	
  at	
  which	
  point	
  the	
  ligaments	
  are	
  slack.	
  The	
  middle	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  demonstrates	
  even	
  greater	
  variability	
  in	
  its	
  attachment,	
  size,	
  and	
  integrity	
  than	
  the	
  supe-­‐rior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament.	
  When	
  the	
  ligament	
  is	
  present,	
  it	
  typically	
  originates	
  just	
  inferior	
  to	
  the	
  superior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  at	
  the	
  supraglenoid	
  tubercle	
  or	
  at	
  the	
  same	
  level	
  from	
  the	
  glenoid	
  neck	
  and	
  inserts	
  into	
  the	
  humerus	
  just	
  medial	
  to	
  the	
  lesser	
  tuberosity.25	
  The	
  thickness	
  of	
  the	
  middle	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  has	
  been	
  found	
  to	
  vary	
  tremendously,	
  from	
  a	
  thick	
  well-­‐defined	
  structure	
  to	
  a	
  gossamer	
  thickening	
  of	
  the	
  anterior	
  capsule.42	
  Additionally,	
  this	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  has	
  been	
  shown	
  to	
  be	
  absent	
  in	
  27%	
  of	
  shoulders.15	
  Although	
  the	
  middle	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament’s	
  contribution	
  to	
  glenohumeral	
  stability	
  varies	
  in	
  accordance	
  with	
  its	
  size	
  and	
  integrity,	
  studies	
  have	
  found	
  that	
  its	
  primary	
  function	
  is	
  to	
  restrain	
  inferior	
  translation	
  when	
  the	
  arm	
  is	
  adducted	
  and	
  externally	
  rotated.16	
  It	
  also	
  works	
  as	
  an	
  accessory	
  stabilizer	
  to	
  anterior	
  translation	
  following	
  damage	
  to	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  gleno-­‐humeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  when	
  the	
  arm	
  is	
  abducted	
  to	
  90	
  degrees.40	
  The	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  is	
  perhaps	
  the	
  most	
  critical	
  for	
  the	
  prevention	
  of	
  dislocation	
  in	
  an	
  abducted	
  shoulder40,43	
  and	
  surgical	
  intervention	
  for	
  anterior	
  glenohumeral	
  instability	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐4).	
  Selective	
  sectioning	
  experi-­‐ments15,29,36,44	
  have	
  helped	
  elucidate	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament’s	
  role	
  as	
  the	
  most	
  important	
  static	
  stabilizer	
  of	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint	
  anteriorly.	
  As	
  O’Brien	
  and	
  colleagues15	
  have	
  delineated,	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  consists	
  of	
  three	
  distinct	
  components—the	
  anterior	
  band,	
  axillary	
  pouch,	
  and	
  posterior	
  band.	
  Together,	
  these	
  three	
  com-­‐
ponents	
  make	
  up	
  what	
  has	
  been	
  referred	
  to	
  as	
  a	
  hammock-­‐like	
  structure	
  that	
  offers	
  anterior,	
  posterior,	
  and	
  inferior	
  stabil-­‐ity	
  to	
  the	
  abducted	
  glenohumeral	
  joint.	
  Anatomically,	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  takes	
  its	
  origin	
  from	
  between	
  the	
  2-­‐	
  and	
  4-­‐o’clock	
  positions	
  on	
  the	
  face	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐5).15	
  Histologic	
  examination	
  has	
  revealed	
  that	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament’s	
  attachment	
  to	
  the	
  glenoid	
  is	
  facilitated	
  by	
  direct	
  attachment	
  of	
  collagen	
  fibers	
  to	
  the	
  labrum	
  and	
  by	
  collagen	
  fibers	
  that	
  interact	
  directly	
  with	
  the	
  bone.45	
  Meanwhile,	
  the	
  posterior	
  band	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  takes	
  its	
  origin	
  from	
  between	
  the	
  7-­‐	
  and	
  9-­‐o’clock	
  positions	
  along	
  the	
  face	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid	
  and	
  has	
  been	
  shown	
  to	
  be	
  less	
  consistent	
  than	
  either	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  or	
  the	
  axillary	
  pouch	
  in	
  its	
  structure	
  and	
  function.46	
  Histologically,	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  consists	
  of	
  three	
  layers,	
  similar	
  to	
  the	
  structure	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  capsule	
  described	
  earlier.	
  However,	
  the	
  perpendicularly	
  oriented	
  fiber	
  pattern	
  within	
  the	
  three	
  layers	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligaments	
  makes	
  it	
  easy	
  to	
  differentiate	
  it	
  from	
  the	
  capsule.	
  Both	
  the	
  an-­‐terior	
  and	
  posterior	
  bands	
  consist	
  of	
  easily	
  distinguishable,	
  abrupt,	
  and	
  well-­‐organized	
  collagen	
  bundles	
  visualized	
  as	
  thick-­‐enings	
  of	
  the	
  innermost	
  layer.	
  In	
  between	
  the	
  anterior	
  and	
  posterior	
  bands	
  lies	
  the	
  thickest	
  section,	
  the	
  axillary	
  pouch,	
  which	
  similarly	
  runs	
  from	
  the	
  gle-­‐noid	
  to	
  the	
  humerus	
  and	
  is	
  continuous	
  with	
  the	
  other	
  two	
  elements	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  an-­‐teroposteriorly.	
  Histologically,	
  however,	
  the	
  axillary	
  pouch	
  differs	
  from	
  the	
  anterior	
  and	
  posterior	
  bands	
  in	
  the	
  orientation	
  of	
  its	
  collagen	
  fibers.	
  O’Brien	
  and	
  associates15	
  noted	
  in	
  their	
  landmark	
  paper	
  that	
  the	
  collagen	
  fibers	
  of	
  the	
  axillary	
  pouch	
  are	
  not	
  synchronously	
  aligned,	
  but	
  rather	
  are	
  less	
  well	
  organized	
  and	
  exhibit	
  mixing	
  of	
  fibers	
  from	
  the	
  inner	
  and	
  middle	
  layers	
  of	
  the	
  capsule,	
  making	
  differentiation	
  difficult.	
  More	
  recently,	
  however,	
  others	
  have	
  described	
  the	
  collagen	
  fiber	
  pattern	
  of	
  the	
  axillary	
  pouch	
  to	
  be	
  more	
  organized	
  than	
  originally	
  proposed,	
  to	
  have	
  a	
  radial	
  pattern	
  in	
  the	
  ligament’s	
  midsubstance,47	
  and	
  to	
  have	
  a	
  multiaxial	
  fiber	
  orientation	
  that	
  is	
  somewhat	
  similar	
  to	
  that	
  seen	
  in	
  the	
  anterior	
  and	
  posterior	
  bands.48	
  Bigliani	
  and	
  coworkers19	
  have	
  determined	
  that	
  the	
  tensile	
  strength	
  of	
  each	
  of	
  the	
  three	
  components	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  is	
  comparable	
  when	
  corrected	
  for	
  thickness	
  and	
  surface	
  area,	
  supporting	
  the	
  notion	
  that	
  the	
  axillary	
  pouch	
  consists	
  of	
  equally	
  organized	
  collagen	
  fibers.	
  The	
  anterior	
  band,	
  axillary	
  pouch,	
  and	
  posterior	
  band	
  have	
  been	
  shown	
  to	
  be	
  thicker	
  toward	
  their	
  glenoid	
  origin	
  than	
  laterally	
  at	
  their	
  humeral	
  insertions.46	
  Furthermore,	
  the	
  three	
  components	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  exhibit	
  simi-­‐lar	
  length,	
  about	
  43	
  mm,	
  despite	
  the	
  differences	
  in	
  their	
  thickness,	
  structure,	
  and	
  sites	
  of	
  origin	
  and	
  insertion.	
  The	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex,	
  which	
  originates	
  between	
  2	
  and	
  9	
  o’clock	
  on	
  the	
  face	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid,	
  follows	
  two	
  separate	
  insertion	
  patterns	
  on	
  the	
  humerus:	
  (1)	
  a	
  collar-­‐like	
  attachment	
  in	
  which	
  the	
  entire	
  complex	
  inserts	
  along	
  the	
  same	
  circumferential	
  ring,	
  slightly	
  inferior	
  to	
  the	
  articular	
  margin	
  of	
  the	
  humeral	
  head;	
  and	
  (2)	
  a	
  V-­‐shaped	
  attachment,	
  which	
  gleans	
  its	
  name	
  from	
  the	
  shape	
  that	
  results	
  when	
  the	
  anterior	
  and	
  posterior	
  bands	
  attach	
  just	
  inferior	
  to	
  the	
  articu-­‐lar	
  margin,	
  and	
  the	
  axillary	
  pouch	
  attaches	
  further	
  inferiorly	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐6).15	
  As	
  mentioned	
  earlier,	
  the	
  three	
  components	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  act	
  in	
  concert	
  as	
  the	
  primary	
  sta-­‐bilizer	
  of	
  the	
  abducted	
  shoulder	
  through	
  their	
  hammock-­‐like	
  action	
  around	
  the	
  axis	
  of	
  rotation	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐7).	
  Depending	
  on	
  the	
  position	
  of	
  the	
  arm,	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  can	
  stabilize	
  against	
  anterior,	
  posterior,	
  and	
  inferior	
  transla-­‐tion.	
  As	
  the	
  arm	
  is	
  abducted	
  to	
  90	
  degrees,	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  tightens	
  beneath	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  and	
  acts	
  as	
  the	
  main	
  stabilizer	
  against	
  inferior	
  translation,	
  because	
  the	
  nature	
  of	
  the	
  superior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  renders	
  it	
  slack	
  and	
  ineffective	
  at	
  this	
  degree	
  of	
  abduction.	
  O’Brien	
  and	
  colleagues40	
  have	
  demonstrated	
  anteroposterior	
  translation	
  of	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint	
  to	
  be	
  greatest	
  when	
  the	
  abducted	
  arm	
  is	
  at	
  0	
  degrees	
  of	
  extension.	
  Furthermore,	
  they	
  have	
  shown	
  that	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  of	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  is	
  the	
  primary	
  mechanism	
  for	
  resisting	
  anterior-­‐posterior	
  transla-­‐tion	
  with	
  the	
  abducted	
  arm	
  in	
  the	
  neutral	
  position	
  or	
  in	
  30	
  degrees	
  of	
  extension	
  as	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  becomes	
  taut.	
  However,	
  when	
  the	
  90-­‐degree	
  abducted	
  arm	
  is	
  moved	
  into	
  30	
  degrees	
  of	
  forward	
  flexion,	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  becomes	
  slack,	
  allowing	
  the	
  now	
  taut	
  posterior	
  band	
  to	
  bear	
  the	
  burden	
  of	
  stabilizing	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint	
  against	
  anterior-­‐posterior	
  translation.	
  Simi-­‐larly,	
  the	
  hammock-­‐like	
  action	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐8)	
  acts	
  to	
  stabilize	
  this	
  diarthrodial	
  joint	
  further	
  when	
  the	
  abducted	
  humerus	
  is	
  externally	
  rotated.	
  In	
  such	
  a	
  position,	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  and	
  axillary	
  pouch	
  fan	
  
out	
  anteriorly	
  to	
  provide	
  support	
  to	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  and	
  stabilize	
  the	
  joint	
  against	
  anterior	
  translation.49	
  Conversely,	
  the	
  same	
  is	
  true	
  of	
  the	
  posterior	
  band	
  and	
  axillary	
  pouch,	
  which	
  provide	
  posterior	
  support	
  to	
  the	
  internally	
  rotated	
  abducted	
  arm	
  as	
  fibers	
  of	
  the	
  posterior	
  band	
  and	
  axillary	
  pouch	
  fan	
  out	
  posteriorly	
  to	
  cradle	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  and	
  resist	
  pos-­‐terior	
  instabil-­‐ity.	
  Although	
  of	
  a	
  variable	
  thickness,15,19,50	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  is	
  continuous	
  with	
  the	
  remainder	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  capsule	
  anteriorly	
  and	
  posteriorly.	
  Continuity	
  of	
  this	
  hammock-­‐like	
  structure	
  with	
  the	
  rest	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  capsule	
  is	
  tremendously	
  important	
  because	
  it	
  allows	
  us	
  to	
  consider	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  as	
  a	
  hammock	
  within	
  a	
  hammock	
  (see	
  Fig.	
  17-­‐8).	
  That	
  is,	
  action	
  can	
  be	
  taken	
  surgically	
  at	
  various	
  places	
  in	
  the	
  shoulder	
  cap-­‐sule	
  that	
  will	
  affect	
  (tightening	
  or	
  loosening)	
  the	
  hammock-­‐like	
  action	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex.	
  This	
  surgical	
  approach,	
  particularly	
  through	
  manipulation	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval,	
  allows	
  the	
  surgeon	
  to	
  exploit	
  the	
  hammock	
  within	
  a	
  hammock	
  concept	
  in	
  a	
  way	
  that	
  restores	
  anterior	
  stability	
  to	
  the	
  ailing	
  patient.	
  (See	
  later,	
  “Surgical	
  Techniques	
  To	
  Correct	
  Anterior	
  Instability,”	
  for	
  further	
  discussion	
  of	
  this	
  topic.)	
  The	
  final	
  anatomic	
  component	
  that	
  demands	
  attention	
  is	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval.	
  The	
  rotator interval	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐9)	
  is	
  a	
  term	
  first	
  used	
  by	
  Neer51	
  to	
  describe	
  a	
  triangular	
  area	
  defined	
  medially	
  by	
  the	
  coracoid	
  process,	
  superiorly	
  by	
  the	
  anterior	
  border	
  of	
  the	
  supraspinatus	
  tendon,	
  and	
  inferiorly	
  by	
  the	
  superior	
  aspect	
  of	
  the	
  subscapularis	
  tendon.52	
  The	
  contents	
  of	
  this	
  triangu-­‐lar	
  space	
  include	
  the	
  coracohumeral	
  ligament,	
  superior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament,	
  middle	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament,	
  and	
  long	
  head	
  of	
  the	
  biceps	
  tendon,	
  which	
  runs	
  through	
  the	
  intertubercular	
  groove.53	
  Jost	
  and	
  associates39	
  have	
  further	
  elucidated	
  the	
  layers	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval	
  through	
  a	
  series	
  of	
  dissections.	
  They	
  determined	
  that	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval	
  space	
  is	
  actually	
  two	
  parts	
  differentiated	
  by	
  the	
  number	
  of	
  tissue	
  layers.	
  One	
  part	
  is	
  defined	
  as	
  lateral	
  to	
  the	
  cartilage	
  bone	
  transition	
  and	
  consists	
  of	
  four	
  layers—superficial	
  fibers	
  of	
  the	
  coracohumeral	
  ligament,	
  fibers	
  of	
  the	
  supraspinatus	
  tendon	
  and	
  subscapu-­‐laris	
  tendon,	
  deep	
  fibers	
  of	
  the	
  coracohumeral	
  ligament,	
  and	
  fibers	
  of	
  the	
  superior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  and	
  joint	
  cap-­‐sule.	
  The	
  other	
  more	
  medial	
  part	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval	
  covers	
  the	
  cartilaginous	
  humeral	
  head	
  and	
  consists	
  of	
  only	
  two	
  layers,	
  the	
  coracohumeral	
  ligament	
  and	
  the	
  superior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  and	
  joint	
  capsule.	
  Operative	
  experience	
  has	
  revealed	
  that	
  the	
  thickness	
  and	
  composition	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval	
  are	
  highly	
  variable	
  and	
  can	
  be	
  visualized	
  arthroscopi-­‐cally,	
  ranging	
  from	
  a	
  thick	
  strong	
  barrier	
  to	
  an	
  almost	
  translucent	
  wispy	
  structure	
  invariably	
  unable	
  to	
  offer	
  structural	
  support	
  beyond	
  maintenance	
  of	
  negative	
  intra-­‐articular	
  pressure.	
  Such	
  anatomic	
  variability	
  was	
  demonstrated	
  by	
  Cole	
  and	
  coworkers53	
  in	
  2001	
  when	
  they	
  evaluated	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval	
  regions	
  from	
  37	
  fetuses	
  and	
  10	
  fresh-­‐frozen	
  cadavers,	
  dem-­‐onstrating	
  that	
  the	
  inner	
  capsular	
  layer	
  of	
  75%	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  intervals	
  studied	
  lacks	
  a	
  continuous	
  link	
  of	
  loosely	
  associated	
  collagenous	
  connective	
  tissue;	
  instead,	
  it	
  is	
  covered	
  only	
  by	
  a	
  thin	
  synovial	
  membrane.	
  PATHOLOGIC LESIONS AND ANTERIOR INSTABILITY A	
  number	
  of	
  pathologic	
  lesions	
  have	
  been	
  identified	
  that	
  result	
  in	
  or	
  contribute	
  to	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability.	
  Subfailure	
  strain	
  on	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  and	
  the	
  resulting	
  microtrauma,	
  anteroinferior	
  labral	
  lesions	
  (Bank-­‐art	
  lesions),	
  rupture	
  injury	
  to	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex,	
  and	
  bone	
  defects	
  are	
  all	
  common	
  pathologic	
  consequences	
  of	
  the	
  violent	
  forces	
  imposed	
  on	
  the	
  joint	
  during	
  athletic	
  activities.	
  Before	
  discussing	
  these	
  pathologic	
  lesions	
  and	
  their	
  surgical	
  treatment	
  in	
  detail,	
  it	
  is	
  first	
  important	
  to	
  understand	
  the	
  extent	
  of	
  the	
  damage	
  caused	
  by	
  an	
  anterior	
  dislocation	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder.	
  It	
  is	
  best	
  to	
  think	
  of	
  the	
  capsuloligamentous	
  struc-­‐tures	
  spanning	
  the	
  glenoid	
  and	
  humeral	
  head	
  as	
  being	
  continuous,	
  similar	
  to	
  a	
  circle,	
  just	
  like	
  the	
  previously	
  described	
  hammock	
  within	
  a	
  hammock	
  concept.	
  In	
  such	
  a	
  model,	
  damage	
  to	
  anterior	
  and	
  posterior	
  structures	
  is	
  present,	
  even	
  though	
  anterior	
  instability	
  predominates	
  clinically	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐10).	
  Anterior	
  dislocation,	
  therefore,	
  results	
  in	
  two	
  traumas:	
  (1)	
  anterior	
  damage	
  typically	
  manifested	
  as	
  a	
  Bankart	
  lesion;	
  and	
  (2)	
  reciprocal	
  posterior	
  capsuloligamentous	
  laxity	
  from	
  damage	
  to	
  the	
  hammock.	
  Therefore,	
  it	
  is	
  common	
  for	
  cases	
  of	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability	
  to	
  manifest	
  clinically	
  with	
  some	
  degree	
  of	
  posterior	
  laxity.	
  Similarly,	
  anterior	
  laxity	
  will	
  accompany	
  posterior	
  dislocation.	
  This	
  concept	
  has	
  been	
  
reinforced	
  by	
  studies	
  that	
  have	
  revealed	
  anterior	
  and	
  posterior	
  injury	
  of	
  the	
  capsule	
  resulting	
  from	
  a	
  unidirectional	
  trauma	
  in	
  the	
  cadaveric	
  shoulder.54-­‐56	
  Speer	
  and	
  colleagues57	
  have	
  demonstrated	
  with	
  a	
  cadaveric	
  model	
  that	
  anteroinferior	
  labral	
  injury	
  increases	
  the	
  amount	
  of	
  anterior	
  glenohumeral	
  translation	
  by	
  a	
  mean	
  of	
  3.4	
  mm.	
  They	
  deemed	
  this	
  degree	
  of	
  translation	
  minimal,	
  unable	
  to	
  ac-­‐count	
  for	
  anterior	
  dislocation	
  of	
  the	
  joint	
  on	
  its	
  own,	
  and	
  suggested	
  that	
  other	
  anatomic	
  abnormalities,	
  especially	
  capsular	
  stretching,	
  must	
  be	
  present	
  to	
  permit	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  to	
  dislocate	
  anteriorly.	
  A	
  Bankart	
  lesion	
  typically	
  occurs	
  as	
  a	
  result	
  of	
  anterior	
  humeral	
  head	
  dislocation.	
  It	
  is	
  defined	
  as	
  a	
  detachment	
  of	
  the	
  an-­‐teroinferior	
  glenoid	
  labrum,	
  with	
  its	
  attached	
  anterior	
  band	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex.	
  A	
  Bankart	
  le-­‐sion	
  causes	
  a	
  decrease	
  in	
  the	
  tension	
  of	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  and	
  thus	
  reduces	
  the	
  ligament’s	
  ability	
  to	
  retain	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  in	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa,	
  especially	
  with	
  the	
  arm	
  in	
  positions	
  of	
  glenohumeral	
  vulnerability.	
  It	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  reiterate	
  that	
  as	
  the	
  shoulder	
  reaches	
  90	
  degrees	
  of	
  abduction	
  with	
  external	
  rotation,	
  the	
  primary	
  re-­‐straints	
  to	
  anterior	
  translation	
  are	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  and	
  axillary	
  pouch	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex,	
  which	
  fan	
  anteriorly.40	
  In	
  90	
  degrees	
  of	
  abduction	
  and	
  forward	
  flexion,	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  becomes	
  slack,	
  whereas	
  the	
  pos-­‐terior	
  band	
  tightens	
  and	
  acts	
  to	
  prevent	
  anterior	
  translation.	
  Therefore,	
  to	
  restore	
  stability	
  to	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint,	
  even	
  in	
  the	
  case	
  of	
  anteroinferior	
  avulsion	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid	
  labrum,	
  competency	
  and	
  proper	
  tensioning	
  of	
  all	
  three	
  components	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  must	
  be	
  re-­‐established.	
  Two	
  other	
  types	
  of	
  injury	
  to	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  can	
  occur	
  in	
  the	
  athlete’s	
  shoulder,	
  rupture	
  of	
  the	
  ligament	
  and	
  subfailure	
  injury	
  resulting	
  in	
  elongation	
  stretching	
  of	
  capsuloligamentous	
  tissues.	
  There	
  are	
  three	
  potential	
  sites	
  of	
  failure	
  for	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  complex:	
  (1)	
  at	
  the	
  glenoid	
  insertion;	
  (2)	
  in	
  the	
  ligament’s	
  midsubstance;	
  and	
  (3)	
  at	
  the	
  humeral	
  insertion	
  point.	
  During	
  unidirectional	
  testing,	
  studies	
  have	
  indicated	
  that	
  40%	
  of	
  specimens	
  rupture	
  at	
  their	
  glenoid	
  origin	
  (Bankart	
  lesion),	
  35%	
  fail	
  in	
  the	
  midsubstance,	
  and	
  25%	
  fail	
  at	
  the	
  humeral	
  insertion.19	
  Wolf	
  and	
  col-­‐leagues58	
  have	
  looked	
  arthroscopically	
  at	
  64	
  shoulders	
  with	
  diagnosed	
  anterior	
  instability	
  and	
  found	
  that	
  just	
  9.3%	
  of	
  pa-­‐tients	
  present	
  with	
  a	
  humeral	
  avulsion	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  anteriorly,	
  17.2%	
  of	
  patients	
  demon-­‐strate	
  generalized	
  capsular	
  laxity,	
  and	
  the	
  overwhelming	
  majority	
  of	
  patients,	
  73.5%,	
  present	
  with	
  a	
  primary	
  Bankart	
  lesion.	
  Malicky	
  and	
  associates58	
  have	
  demonstrated	
  through	
  a	
  new	
  technique	
  that	
  stress	
  on	
  the	
  anteroinferior	
  capsule	
  yields	
  vari-­‐able	
  force	
  vectors	
  with	
  a	
  multiaxial	
  representation.	
  Furthermore,	
  their	
  biomechanical	
  analysis	
  showed	
  that	
  the	
  highest	
  lev-­‐els	
  of	
  strain	
  on	
  the	
  anteroinferior	
  capsule	
  are	
  near	
  the	
  ligament’s	
  glenoid	
  insertion	
  as	
  opposed	
  to	
  near	
  the	
  humeral	
  inser-­‐tion.	
  Although	
  the	
  most	
  common	
  pathology	
  seen	
  in	
  anterior	
  instability	
  is	
  certainly	
  a	
  primary	
  Bankart	
  lesion,	
  it	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  rule	
  out	
  humeral	
  insertion	
  failures58	
  through	
  arthroscopic	
  visualization	
  or	
  radiographic	
  imaging.	
  Variable	
  subfailure	
  stresses	
  encountered	
  by	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint	
  have	
  been	
  implicated	
  in	
  stretching	
  of	
  the	
  associated	
  capsuloligamentous	
  structures.	
  Bigliani	
  and	
  coworkers19	
  have	
  in	
  fact	
  noted	
  significant	
  elongation	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  gleno-­‐humeral	
  ligament	
  complex.	
  Pollock	
  and	
  colleagues61	
  have	
  determined,	
  through	
  exposure	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  to	
  several	
  different	
  levels	
  of	
  subfailure	
  stress,	
  that	
  repetitive	
  loads	
  similar	
  to	
  those	
  experienced	
  by	
  athletes	
  result	
  in	
  ligament	
  elongation	
  and	
  joint	
  laxity.	
  Moreover,	
  they	
  speculated	
  that	
  this	
  unrecoverable	
  ligamentous	
  elongation	
  might	
  be	
  the	
  end	
  product	
  of	
  accumulated	
  microdamage	
  to	
  the	
  ligament	
  tissues.	
  This	
  concept	
  was	
  used	
  by	
  Remia	
  and	
  associates62	
  to	
  stretch	
  the	
  capsuloligamentous	
  structures	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  to	
  20%	
  beyond	
  their	
  original	
  length	
  to	
  create	
  a	
  model	
  of	
  gener-­‐alized	
  glenohumeral	
  laxity	
  with	
  increased	
  rotation	
  and	
  translation	
  for	
  analysis	
  of	
  various	
  surgical	
  techniques.	
  Bone	
  pathology	
  associated	
  with	
  anterior	
  instability	
  is	
  not	
  uncommon.	
  The	
  Hill-­‐Sachs	
  lesion	
  occurs	
  on	
  the	
  posterior	
  aspect	
  of	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  as	
  a	
  result	
  of	
  the	
  violent	
  collision	
  between	
  the	
  posterior	
  humeral	
  head	
  and	
  anterior	
  glenoid	
  rim	
  during	
  an-­‐terior	
  dislocation.	
  A	
  Hill-­‐Sachs	
  lesion	
  that	
  interacts	
  with	
  the	
  anterior	
  glenoid	
  rim	
  when	
  the	
  arm	
  is	
  in	
  90	
  degrees	
  abduction	
  and	
  external	
  rotation	
  has	
  been	
  termed	
  an	
  engaging Hill-Sachs lesion	
  by	
  Burkhart	
  and	
  De	
  Beer63	
  and	
  noted	
  to	
  be	
  a	
  contraindication	
  for	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilization.	
  They	
  also	
  described	
  a	
  glenoid	
  in	
  which	
  the	
  bone	
  has	
  been	
  ground	
  down	
  anteroinferiorly	
  as	
  an	
  inverted	
  pear	
  glenoid	
  and	
  noted	
  this	
  as	
  another	
  contraindication	
  to	
  arthroscopic	
  repair.	
  Sugaya	
  and	
  associates64	
  have	
  used	
  three-­‐dimensional	
  reconstructed	
  computed	
  tomography	
  (CT)	
  to	
  evaluate	
  100	
  shoulders	
  of	
  patients	
  with	
  recurrent	
  anterior	
  
glenohumeral	
  instability.	
  They	
  found	
  that	
  osseous	
  Bankart	
  lesions	
  are	
  present	
  in	
  50%	
  of	
  cases.	
  Additionally,	
  40%	
  of	
  patients	
  had	
  scans	
  consistent	
  with	
  erosion	
  or	
  compression	
  of	
  the	
  anterior	
  glenoid	
  rim.	
  SURGICAL TECHNIQUES TO CORRECT ANTERIOR INSTABILITY Historically,	
  the	
  methods	
  for	
  the	
  surgical	
  correction	
  of	
  anterior	
  glenohumeral	
  shoulder	
  instability	
  have	
  fallen	
  into	
  one	
  of	
  two	
  distinct	
  genres—anatomic	
  reconstruction	
  or	
  nonanatomic	
  reconstruction.	
  Anatomic	
  reconstruction	
  focuses	
  on	
  restor-­‐ing	
  normal	
  anatomy	
  to	
  the	
  shoulder	
  joint	
  by	
  addressing	
  pathology	
  associated	
  with	
  dislocation.	
  To	
  be	
  effective,	
  anatomic	
  reconstruction	
  must	
  pay	
  particular	
  attention	
  to	
  the	
  hammock-­‐like	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex.	
  Conversely,	
  the	
  emphasis	
  of	
  nonanatomic	
  approaches	
  is	
  to	
  construct	
  new	
  structures	
  to	
  contain	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  and	
  thus	
  prevent	
  anterior	
  dislocation.	
  Effective	
  primary	
  surgical	
  treatment	
  of	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  ins-­‐tability	
  lies	
  in	
  anatomic	
  reconstruction,	
  particularly	
  when	
  addressing	
  any	
  pathoanatomy	
  associated	
  with	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex.	
  Open Repair Techniques A	
  Bankart	
  lesion	
  is	
  the	
  most	
  common	
  surgical	
  finding	
  in	
  patients	
  with	
  anterior	
  instability.	
  As	
  such,	
  the	
  open	
  Bankart	
  repair	
  is	
  traditionally	
  considered	
  to	
  be	
  the	
  gold	
  standard	
  for	
  the	
  surgical	
  treatment	
  of	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability.	
  In	
  the	
  classic	
  study	
  by	
  Rowe	
  and	
  colleagues,65	
  a	
  long-­‐term	
  review	
  of	
  145	
  patients	
  treated	
  with	
  open	
  Bankart	
  repairs	
  was	
  conducted;	
  results	
  indi-­‐cated	
  only	
  a	
  3.5%	
  recurrence	
  rate,	
  with	
  69%	
  of	
  patients	
  able	
  to	
  achieve	
  full	
  range	
  of	
  motion.	
  The	
  hallmark	
  of	
  the	
  Bankart	
  repair	
  is	
  restoration	
  of	
  tension	
  to	
  the	
  anteroinferior	
  capsule	
  and	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  liga-­‐ment	
  complex.	
  To	
  address	
  these	
  structures,	
  the	
  surgeon	
  must	
  enter	
  the	
  capsule	
  vertically	
  and	
  medially	
  to	
  the	
  inferior	
  rim	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid.	
  Removal	
  of	
  soft	
  tissue	
  attachments	
  to	
  the	
  glenoid	
  precedes	
  the	
  drilling	
  of	
  three	
  holes	
  in	
  the	
  glenoid,	
  through	
  which	
  sutures	
  are	
  passed	
  to	
  facilitate	
  the	
  superomedial	
  advancement	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  capsule	
  and	
  anterior	
  band	
  of	
  the	
  infe-­‐rior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex.	
  Such	
  superomedial	
  advancement	
  of	
  these	
  structures	
  restores	
  tension	
  to	
  the	
  ham-­‐mock-­‐like	
  complex.	
  This	
  technique,	
  however,	
  is	
  often	
  ineffective	
  for	
  treating	
  anteriorly	
  dislocating	
  patients	
  with	
  excessive	
  capsular	
  laxity	
  or	
  for	
  treating	
  multidirectional	
  instability	
  patients	
  who	
  primarily	
  dislocate	
  anteriorly.	
  Treating	
  these	
  patients	
  requires	
  a	
  form	
  of	
  capsular	
  shift	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐11).	
  Neer	
  and	
  Foster66	
  have	
  described	
  an	
  inferior	
  capsular	
  shift	
  in	
  which	
  lax	
  capsular	
  tissue	
  is	
  ad-­‐dressed	
  via	
  lateral	
  and	
  vertical	
  incisions	
  through	
  the	
  capsule	
  (see	
  Fig.	
  17-­‐11A)	
  at	
  the	
  humeral	
  neck	
  and	
  advanced	
  laterally	
  and	
  superiorly	
  (see	
  Fig.	
  17-­‐11B),	
  thus	
  removing	
  capsular	
  redundancy.	
  Recommended Open Technique T-­‐plasty	
  modification	
  of	
  the	
  Bankart	
  repair	
  has	
  been	
  described	
  by	
  Altchek	
  and	
  associates67	
  as	
  a	
  method	
  to	
  correct	
  multidi-­‐rectional	
  instability	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐12).	
  In	
  this	
  technique,	
  both	
  a	
  transverse	
  incision	
  in	
  the	
  capsular	
  midsubstance	
  and	
  a	
  vertical	
  incision	
  along	
  the	
  glenoid	
  margin	
  are	
  used	
  (see	
  Fig.	
  17-­‐12A).	
  The	
  latter	
  incision	
  is	
  used	
  first	
  to	
  inspect	
  the	
  joint	
  for	
  a	
  Bank-­‐art	
  lesion	
  and	
  then	
  to	
  repair	
  that	
  lesion,	
  if	
  present	
  (see	
  Fig.	
  17-­‐12B).	
  The	
  transverse	
  incision	
  affords	
  the	
  ability	
  to	
  advance	
  the	
  inferior	
  flap	
  superiorly	
  and	
  the	
  superior	
  flap	
  inferiorly	
  to	
  imbricate	
  the	
  capsule,	
  thereby	
  reducing	
  joint	
  laxity.	
  Arthroscopic Repair Tremendous	
  advancements	
  have	
  been	
  made	
  in	
  the	
  arthroscopic	
  treatment	
  of	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability	
  since	
  Johnson	
  and	
  Bayley68	
  introduced	
  the	
  arthroscopic	
  application	
  of	
  metal	
  staples	
  as	
  a	
  method	
  for	
  repairing	
  a	
  Bankart	
  lesion.	
  Today,	
  many	
  arthroscopic	
  methods	
  have	
  been	
  described	
  in	
  the	
  literature,	
  including	
  transglenoid	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilization,	
  an-­‐chor	
  fixation,	
  and	
  thermal	
  capsulorrhaphy.	
  Failure	
  rates	
  of	
  these	
  procedures	
  vary	
  among	
  studies,	
  and	
  the	
  relative	
  indica-­‐tions	
  for	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilization	
  versus	
  open	
  stabilization	
  will	
  be	
  discussed	
  elsewhere	
  in	
  this	
  text	
  (Chapter	
  21).	
  Before	
  beginning	
  any	
  arthroscopic	
  procedure,	
  a	
  complete	
  examination	
  under	
  anesthesia	
  should	
  be	
  performed	
  comparing	
  the	
  injured	
  shoulder	
  with	
  the	
  contralateral	
  shoulder,	
  because	
  such	
  an	
  assessment	
  is	
  often	
  difficult	
  to	
  perform	
  on	
  the	
  
awake	
  patient.	
  Once	
  the	
  arthroscope	
  is	
  introduced	
  into	
  the	
  injured	
  shoulder,	
  a	
  thorough	
  arthroscopic	
  evaluation	
  of	
  the	
  status	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex,	
  labrum,	
  rotator	
  cuff,	
  and	
  any	
  bony	
  lesions	
  that	
  may	
  be	
  present	
  should	
  be	
  performed.	
  In	
  addition	
  to	
  these	
  two	
  procedures,	
  the	
  arthroscopic	
  drive-­‐through	
  sign69-­‐71	
  is	
  often	
  a	
  valuable	
  intraoperative	
  tool	
  for	
  as-­‐sessment	
  of	
  glenohumeral	
  laxity.	
  The	
  arthroscopic	
  drive-­‐through	
  sign	
  is	
  the	
  ability	
  to	
  maneuver	
  the	
  arthroscope	
  in	
  between	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  and	
  the	
  glenoid	
  fossa	
  at	
  the	
  level	
  of	
  the	
  anterior	
  band	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex.	
  McFarland	
  and	
  coworkers72	
  have	
  evaluated	
  the	
  clinical	
  significance	
  of	
  the	
  drive-­‐through	
  sign	
  and	
  its	
  pertinence	
  to	
  the	
  diag-­‐noses	
  of	
  various	
  shoulder	
  abnormalities.	
  They	
  examined	
  234	
  shoulders	
  arthroscopically	
  and	
  found	
  that	
  the	
  drive-­‐through	
  sign	
  has	
  a	
  high	
  sensitivity	
  (92%)	
  and	
  negative	
  predictive	
  value	
  (94.2%),	
  but	
  low	
  specificity	
  (37.6%)	
  for	
  glenohumeral	
  insta-­‐bility.	
  Their	
  results	
  indicate	
  that	
  a	
  positive	
  drive-­‐through	
  sign	
  should	
  be	
  used	
  in	
  conjunction	
  with	
  other	
  diagnostic	
  criteria	
  in	
  determining	
  shoulder	
  instability,	
  because	
  it	
  is	
  not	
  in	
  itself	
  specific	
  to	
  the	
  pathology.	
  Although	
  the	
  diagnosis	
  of	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability	
  may	
  not	
  accurately	
  be	
  made	
  using	
  this	
  sign,	
  it	
  is	
  our	
  clinical	
  experience	
  that	
  elimination	
  of	
  a	
  positive	
  arthroscopic	
  drive-­‐through	
  sign	
  intraoperatively	
  is	
  a	
  good	
  predictor	
  of	
  proper	
  tensioning	
  of	
  the	
  hammock-­‐like	
  inferior	
  gle-­‐nohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐13).	
  Arthroscopic	
  staple	
  capsulorrhaphy,	
  in	
  which	
  a	
  metal	
  staple	
  is	
  used	
  to	
  repair	
  a	
  Bankart	
  lesion,	
  described	
  in	
  1982	
  by	
  John-­‐son	
  and	
  Bayley,	
  was	
  the	
  first	
  in	
  a	
  series	
  of	
  arthroscopic	
  techniques	
  developed	
  to	
  address	
  pathology	
  associated	
  with	
  ante-­‐rior	
  dislocation	
  of	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint.	
  Reported	
  rates	
  of	
  recurrent	
  dislocation	
  and	
  subluxation	
  in	
  the	
  literature	
  are	
  high.	
  Johnson	
  and	
  Bayley,	
  in	
  fact,	
  have	
  reported	
  a	
  recurrence	
  rate	
  of	
  21%.68	
  Lang	
  and	
  colleagues73	
  have	
  evaluated	
  54	
  shoulders	
  at	
  an	
  average	
  of	
  39	
  months,	
  describing	
  a	
  33%	
  occurrence	
  of	
  postoperative	
  instability,	
  loose	
  staples	
  in	
  15%	
  of	
  patients,	
  and	
  less	
  than	
  50%	
  of	
  treated	
  athletes	
  able	
  to	
  return	
  to	
  overhead	
  sporting	
  activities.	
  Furthermore,	
  Coughlin	
  and	
  associates74	
  have	
  described	
  a	
  25%	
  failure	
  rate	
  among	
  the	
  47	
  patients	
  they	
  followed	
  at	
  4	
  years	
  postoperatively.	
  Because	
  of	
  the	
  substantial	
  failure	
  rates	
  and	
  the	
  occurrence	
  of	
  some	
  articular	
  injuries	
  associated	
  with	
  loose	
  hardware,	
  staple	
  capsulor-­‐rhaphy	
  has	
  been	
  essentially	
  abandoned	
  in	
  favor	
  of	
  newer	
  techniques	
  that	
  attempt	
  to	
  ameliorate	
  these	
  pitfalls.	
  The	
  evaluation	
  of	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilization	
  has	
  included	
  numerous	
  other	
  techniques,	
  such	
  as	
  thermal	
  capsulorrhaphy	
  and	
  anchor	
  fixation.	
  Thermal	
  capsulorrhaphy	
  uses	
  the	
  application	
  of	
  thermal	
  energy75,76	
  to	
  “shrink”	
  the	
  capsule	
  by	
  altering	
  the	
  capsular	
  collagen	
  architecture.	
  Although	
  this	
  technique	
  was	
  widely	
  embraced	
  by	
  orthopedic	
  surgeons	
  in	
  the	
  late	
  1990s	
  because	
  it	
  appeared	
  to	
  offer	
  a	
  quick	
  and	
  effective	
  intervention	
  for	
  management	
  of	
  the	
  unstable	
  shoulder,	
  it	
  has	
  since	
  fallen	
  out	
  of	
  favor	
  specifically	
  because	
  of	
  the	
  variability	
  of	
  the	
  host	
  reaction	
  and	
  its	
  failure	
  to	
  address	
  the	
  primary	
  pathologic	
  process,	
  the	
  Bankart	
  lesion.	
  We	
  believe	
  that	
  thermal	
  capsulorrhaphy	
  is	
  not	
  indicated	
  for	
  the	
  treatment	
  of	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability	
  and	
  that	
  the	
  issues	
  of	
  capsular	
  redundancy	
  are	
  more	
  effectively	
  addressed	
  through	
  closure	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  inter-­‐val.	
  Anchor	
  fixation	
  stabilization	
  is	
  an	
  arthroscopic	
  technique	
  that	
  uses	
  a	
  cannulated	
  spike	
  to	
  repair	
  Bankart	
  lesions.	
  Both	
  bioabsorbable	
  and	
  fixed	
  anchors	
  have	
  been	
  used	
  to	
  this	
  end,	
  each	
  with	
  their	
  own	
  pull-­‐out	
  specifics	
  that	
  must	
  be	
  taken	
  into	
  account.77	
  The	
  surgical	
  technique	
  requires	
  an	
  initial	
  stripping	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid	
  neck	
  so	
  that	
  the	
  labrum	
  is	
  freed	
  to	
  the	
  6-­‐o’clock	
  position,	
  followed	
  by	
  reattachment	
  of	
  the	
  Bankart	
  lesion,78	
  with	
  proper	
  reattachment	
  and	
  tensioning	
  of	
  the	
  infe-­‐rior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex.	
  Arciero	
  and	
  coworkers79	
  have	
  reported	
  on	
  19	
  military	
  cadets	
  followed	
  at	
  a	
  mean	
  of	
  19	
  months,	
  all	
  of	
  whom	
  were	
  treated	
  with	
  bioabsorbable	
  anchor	
  fixation,	
  and	
  there	
  was	
  only	
  one	
  recurrence	
  of	
  subluxa-­‐tion	
  (5%).	
  In	
  this	
  study,	
  all	
  athletes	
  were	
  able	
  to	
  return	
  to	
  preinjury	
  levels	
  of	
  performance	
  and	
  94.7%	
  indicated	
  a	
  Rowe	
  score	
  of	
  good	
  or	
  excellent.	
  Other	
  studies	
  in	
  the	
  literature	
  have	
  reported	
  failure	
  rates	
  of	
  10%,7	
  15%,80	
  and	
  3.2%.81	
  Al-­‐though	
  their	
  results	
  are	
  promising,	
  Cole	
  and	
  colleagues82	
  have	
  emp-­‐hasized	
  the	
  importance	
  of	
  patient	
  selection	
  for	
  bioab-­‐sorbable	
  anchor	
  fixation,	
  with	
  the	
  prime	
  candidate	
  being	
  an	
  individual	
  with	
  a	
  relatively	
  healthy	
  capsule	
  and	
  only	
  a	
  Bank-­‐art	
  lesion	
  resulting	
  from	
  traumatic	
  anterior	
  dislocation.	
  Recommended Arthroscopic Technique 
Suture	
  anchors	
  are	
  the	
  preferred	
  method	
  for	
  arthroscopic	
  repair	
  of	
  anterior	
  glenohumeral	
  instability,	
  because	
  this	
  tech-­‐nique	
  offers	
  the	
  safest	
  and	
  most	
  accurate	
  method	
  for	
  repairing	
  a	
  Bankart	
  lesion.	
  As	
  with	
  any	
  arthroscopic	
  procedure	
  for	
  shoulder	
  instability,	
  examination	
  under	
  anesthesia	
  should	
  be	
  performed	
  to	
  compare	
  the	
  injured	
  shoulder	
  with	
  the	
  contra-­‐lateral	
  shoulder	
  to	
  determine	
  the	
  direction	
  and	
  extent	
  of	
  humeral	
  translation.	
  Furthermore,	
  diagnostic	
  arthroscopy	
  is	
  a	
  useful	
  tool	
  for	
  evaluation	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament,	
  labrum,	
  rotator	
  cuff,	
  and	
  any	
  bony	
  lesions	
  that	
  may	
  be	
  present.	
  With	
  the	
  patient	
  in	
  the	
  beach	
  chair	
  position	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐14),	
  the	
  glenoid	
  neck	
  is	
  first	
  stripped	
  so	
  that	
  the	
  labrum	
  is	
  mobilized	
  to	
  the	
  6-­‐o’clock	
  position.	
  Once	
  this	
  has	
  been	
  accomplished,	
  anchors	
  are	
  screwed	
  into	
  the	
  glenoid	
  rim	
  and	
  sutures	
  are	
  passed	
  at	
  the	
  5-­‐,	
  4-­‐,	
  and	
  3-­‐o’clock	
  positions.	
  The	
  capsuloligamentous	
  tissue	
  is	
  then	
  secured	
  to	
  the	
  anchors	
  via	
  sutures	
  that	
  are	
  tied	
  sequentially,	
  so	
  that	
  proper	
  tension	
  is	
  restored	
  to	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex.83	
  Although	
  suture	
  anchors	
  offer	
  an	
  accurate	
  means	
  of	
  addressing	
  the	
  pathologies	
  of	
  anterior	
  instability,	
  they	
  are	
  not	
  without	
  risk.	
  Eight	
  cases	
  of	
  suture	
  anchor	
  migration	
  were	
  reported	
  by	
  Kaar	
  and	
  associates84	
  in	
  2001,	
  reaffirming	
  the	
  importance	
  of	
  anchor	
  placement	
  and	
  indicating	
  the	
  potential	
  risks	
  associated	
  with	
  implantation	
  of	
  this	
  type	
  of	
  hardware.	
  Rotator	
  interval	
  closure	
  is	
  frequently	
  an	
  integral	
  component	
  of	
  the	
  surgical	
  correction	
  of	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐15).	
  As	
  noted,	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval	
  is	
  a	
  triangular	
  space	
  bordered	
  medially	
  by	
  the	
  coracoid	
  process,	
  inferiorly	
  by	
  the	
  sub-­‐scapularis	
  tendon,	
  and	
  superiorly	
  by	
  the	
  supraspinatus	
  tendon.	
  Field	
  and	
  coworkers85	
  have	
  selectively	
  closed	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval	
  in	
  patients	
  with	
  isolated	
  rotator	
  interval	
  lesions	
  and	
  associated	
  inferior	
  instability	
  and	
  noted	
  good	
  or	
  excellent	
  re-­‐sults	
  in	
  all	
  patients.	
  Manipulation	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval,	
  in	
  addition	
  to	
  an	
  arthroscopic	
  Bankart	
  repair,	
  can	
  be	
  a	
  powerful	
  tool,	
  allowing	
  the	
  surgeon	
  to	
  remove	
  capsular	
  redundancy,	
  especially	
  in	
  patients	
  with	
  an	
  inferior	
  component	
  to	
  their	
  insta-­‐bility.	
  The	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  functions	
  as	
  a	
  hammock-­‐like	
  structure	
  that	
  supports	
  the	
  humeral	
  head	
  throughout	
  a	
  wide	
  range	
  of	
  glenohumeral	
  motion.	
  The	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  sits	
  within	
  and	
  is	
  continu-­‐ous	
  with	
  the	
  remainder	
  of	
  the	
  joint	
  capsule—hence,	
  the	
  hammock	
  within	
  a	
  hammock	
  concept.	
  Thus,	
  closure	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval	
  indirectly	
  tightens	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex.	
  Suture	
  anchor	
  Bankart	
  repair,	
  in	
  conjunction	
  with	
  rotator	
  interval	
  closure,	
  allows	
  the	
  surgeon	
  to	
  address	
  the	
  instability	
  and,	
  more	
  importantly,	
  preserve	
  a	
  patient’s	
  functional	
  needs.	
  Nonanatomic Reconstructions Several	
  nonanatomic	
  surgical	
  repairs	
  of	
  anterior	
  glenohumeral	
  instability	
  have	
  been	
  described	
  over	
  the	
  years.	
  The	
  general	
  goal	
  of	
  nonanatomic	
  methods	
  of	
  repair	
  is	
  to	
  stabilize	
  the	
  glenohumeral	
  joint	
  by	
  creating	
  physical	
  obstacles	
  to	
  humeral	
  translation.	
  Nonanatomic	
  repairs	
  come	
  in	
  three	
  different	
  forms:	
  (1)	
  subscapularis	
  muscle	
  alteration	
  procedures;	
  (2)	
  suspensory	
  proce-­‐dures;	
  and	
  (3)	
  bone	
  block	
  procedures.	
  Although	
  some	
  of	
  these	
  nonanatomic	
  techniques	
  have	
  been	
  reported	
  to	
  have	
  positive	
  results	
  in	
  terms	
  of	
  prevention	
  of	
  further	
  shoulder	
  dislocations	
  and	
  patient	
  satisfaction,86,87	
  many	
  associated	
  complications	
  have	
  been	
  associated	
  with	
  these	
  types	
  of	
  repairs,	
  such	
  as	
  recurrent	
  anterior	
  dislocations,	
  restricted	
  motion,	
  and	
  premature	
  os-­‐teoarthritis.86-­‐92	
  Moreover,	
  nonanatomic	
  procedures	
  leave	
  the	
  shoulder’s	
  anatomy	
  altered,	
  leading	
  to	
  increased	
  dif-­‐ficulty	
  for	
  the	
  surgeon	
  in	
  addressing	
  the	
  joint	
  if	
  future	
  revision	
  surgeries	
  become	
  necessary.93,94	
  It	
  is	
  our	
  experience,	
  therefore,	
  that	
  the	
  surgical	
  complications	
  mentioned,	
  along	
  with	
  the	
  failure	
  to	
  address	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex,	
  render	
  nona-­‐natomic	
  approaches	
  ineffective	
  and	
  an	
  inappropriate	
  first	
  line	
  of	
  defense	
  against	
  glenohumeral	
  instability.	
  However,	
  for	
  his-­‐torical	
  purposes,	
  we	
  will	
  briefly	
  outline	
  some	
  of	
  these	
  nonanatomic	
  procedures.	
  Two	
  procedures	
  have	
  been	
  used	
  by	
  orthopedists	
  that	
  involve	
  alteration	
  of	
  the	
  subscapularis	
  muscle.	
  The	
  Putti-­‐Platt	
  proce-­‐dure	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐16)	
  involves	
  both—shortening	
  the	
  subscapularis	
  muscle	
  through	
  its	
  division	
  and	
  subsequent	
  reattachment	
  and	
  reinforcement	
  of	
  the	
  anterior	
  joint	
  through	
  a	
  reattachment	
  that	
  creates	
  overlap	
  of	
  the	
  muscle’s	
  divided	
  ends.95	
  Simi-­‐larly,	
  the	
  Magnuson-­‐Stack	
  procedure	
  attempts	
  to	
  produce	
  stability	
  by	
  advancing	
  the	
  subscapularis	
  tendon	
  laterally,	
  reat-­‐taching	
  it	
  to	
  a	
  point	
  on	
  the	
  humerus	
  just	
  lateral	
  to	
  the	
  bicipital	
  groove.96	
  Two	
  suspensory	
  procedures,	
  the	
  Nicola97,98	
  and	
  Gallie99	
  procedures,	
  are	
  noteworthy.	
  The	
  former	
  uses	
  the	
  long	
  head	
  of	
  the	
  
biceps	
  tendon	
  as	
  a	
  suspensory	
  ligament	
  and	
  the	
  latter	
  uses	
  a	
  graft	
  of	
  fascia	
  lata	
  to	
  suspend	
  the	
  humeral	
  head.	
  Finally,	
  two	
  bone	
  block	
  procedures	
  have	
  been	
  described.	
  The	
  Bristow-­‐Latarjet	
  procedure	
  uses	
  a	
  transfer	
  of	
  the	
  distal	
  end	
  of	
  the	
  coracoid	
  process,	
  including	
  the	
  insertion	
  of	
  the	
  conjoint	
  tendon,	
  to	
  the	
  inferior	
  portion	
  of	
  the	
  glenoid	
  rim,	
  thus	
  pre-­‐venting	
  anterior	
  humeral	
  translation.100,101	
  The	
  Eden-­‐Hybbinette102,103	
  procedure	
  functions	
  via	
  much	
  the	
  same	
  concept—namely,	
  blocking	
  anterior	
  translation	
  of	
  the	
  humerus	
  using	
  a	
  bone	
  block.	
  Both	
  procedures	
  can	
  result	
  in	
  early	
  osteoarthritis	
  and	
  restrictions	
  in	
  range	
  of	
  motion,	
  have	
  been	
  linked	
  to	
  complications	
  arising	
  from	
  the	
  implanted	
  hardware,104,105	
  and	
  can	
  further	
  complicate	
  revision	
  surgery	
  because	
  of	
  significant	
  scarring.93	
  Ongoing Debate: Open Versus Arthroscopic Stabilization Despite	
  the	
  data	
  that	
  exist	
  regarding	
  recurrence	
  rates,	
  postoperative	
  morbidities,	
  and	
  a	
  narrowing	
  of	
  the	
  gap	
  between	
  open	
  and	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilization	
  failure	
  rates,106	
  the	
  decision	
  to	
  pursue	
  one	
  of	
  these	
  two	
  types	
  of	
  stabilization	
  procedures	
  must	
  ultimately	
  be	
  based	
  on	
  what	
  is	
  best	
  for	
  a	
  particular	
  patient.	
  In	
  their	
  2000	
  studies,	
  Cole	
  and	
  colleagues107,108	
  concluded	
  that	
  the	
  outcome	
  differences	
  between	
  open	
  and	
  arthroscopic	
  repair	
  are	
  negligible	
  in	
  the	
  surgical	
  management	
  of	
  traumatic	
  in-­‐stability	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  if	
  patients	
  are	
  selected	
  appropriately,	
  based	
  on	
  observed	
  intraoperative	
  pathoanatomy.	
  Ultimately,	
  a	
  physician	
  who	
  begins	
  an	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilization	
  should	
  never	
  fear	
  conversion	
  to	
  an	
  open	
  repair	
  because	
  “a	
  good	
  open	
  procedure	
  will	
  always	
  outperform	
  a	
  bad	
  arthroscopic	
  one.”94	
  Green	
  and	
  Christensen’s	
  1993	
  study109	
  evaluated	
  common	
  surgical	
  morbidities	
  in	
  38	
  patients	
  who	
  had	
  Bankart	
  repairs	
  (20	
  arthroscopic,	
  18	
  open).	
  They	
  found	
  significant	
  decreases	
  in	
  operative	
  time,	
  blood	
  loss,	
  postoperative	
  narcotic	
  use,	
  hospital	
  stay,	
  postoperative	
  fevers,	
  and	
  time	
  lost	
  from	
  work	
  as	
  compared	
  with	
  patients	
  who	
  underwent	
  an	
  open	
  Bankart	
  repair.	
  Today,	
  most	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilization	
  patients	
  are	
  ambulatory.	
  Moreover,	
  as	
  arthroscopic	
  techniques	
  and	
  collective	
  surgical	
  acumen	
  con-­‐tinue	
  to	
  evolve,	
  these	
  morbidities	
  are	
  certain	
  to	
  show	
  continued	
  improvements.	
  The	
  open	
  Bankart	
  repair	
  is	
  the	
  gold	
  standard	
  for	
  anterior	
  instability	
  treatment	
  and	
  has	
  typically	
  had	
  low

  However,	
  other	
  studies	
  have	
  generated	
  contradictory	
  data.	
  Uhorchak	
  and	
  associates111	
  have	
  reported	
  on	
  66	
  patients	
  followed	
  up	
  at	
  an	
  average	
  of	
  47	
  months;	
  23%

  (3%),	
  fewer	
  than	
  three	
  postoperative	
  subluxations	
  (12%),	
  or	
  multiple	
  recurrent	
  subluxations	
  (8%).	
  Magnusson	
  and	
  coworkers112	
  have	
  reported	
  similarly	
  high	
  failure	
  rates	
  for	
  open	
  repair.	
  Mohtadi	
  and	
  colleagues,113	
  however,	
  came	
  to	
  the	
  conclusion,	
  through	
  their	
  meta-­‐analysis,	
  that	
  “open	
  repair	
  has	
  a	
  more	
  favorable	
  out-­‐come	
  with	
  respect	
  to	
  recurrence	
  and	
  return	
  to	
  activity.”	
  The	
  question	
  must	
  be	
  asked	
  as	
  to	
  whether	
  an	
  open	
  Bankart	
  re-­‐pair	
  is	
  still	
  the	
  gold	
  standard	
  for	
  treatment	
  of	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability.	
  Arthroscopic

  techniques	
  have	
  matured	
  over	
  the	
  past	
  2	
  decades,	
  as	
  evidenced	
  by	
  	
  reports	
  of	
  low	
  failure	
  rates	
  and	
  patient	
  satisfaction.	
  In	
  a	
  comprehensive	
  study	
  of	
  the	
  early	
  evolution	
  of	
  arthroscopic	
  shoulder	
  stabilization,	
  DeBa-­‐rardino

  associates7	
  have	
  conducted	
  an	
  extensive	
  study	
  of	
  127	
  West	
  Point	
  cadets	
  who	
  experienced	
  acute	
  glenohumeral	
  dislocations;	
  72	
  patients	
  were	
  treated	
  with	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilization	
  and	
  evaluated	
  by	
  the

  de-­‐termined	
  by	
  the	
  time	
  period	
  in	
  which	
  the	
  surgery	
  was	
  performed.	
  They	
  found	
  that	
  the	
  first	
  group	
  of	
  9	
  cadets,	
  treated	
  with	
  staple	
  capsulorrhaphy	
  between	
  1986	
  and	
  1988,	
  showed	
  a	
  failure	
  rate	
  of	
  22.2%.	
  The	
  second	
  group	
  of	
  21	
  cadets,	
  treated	
  using	
  transglenoid	
  sutures	
  between	
  1988	
  and	
  1991,	
  demonstrated	
  a	
  failure	
  rate	
  of	
  14%.	
  The	
  final	
  group	
  of	
  42	
  cadets	
  yielded	
  a	
  failure	
  rate	
  of	
  only	
  10%	
  and	
  were	
  treated	
  with	
  bioabsorbable	
  tack	
  fixation.	
  This	
  study	
  is	
  of	
  particular	
  note	
  be-­‐cause	
  it	
  demonstrates	
  the	
  evolution	
  from	
  staple	
  capsulorrhaphy	
  to	
  bioabsorbable	
  anchor	
  fixation	
  and	
  its	
  associated	
  de-­‐crease	
  in	
  failure	
  rates,	
  and	
  because	
  the

  of	
  young	
  men	
  (average	
  age,	
  19.5	
  years)

  active	
  lives.	
  Not	
  all	
  reports	
  have	
  shown	
  failure	
  rates	
  as	
  low	
  as	
  10%.	
  In	
  fact,	
  other	
  studies	
  have	
  reported	
  highly

  failure	
  rates,	
  ranging	
  from	
  0%	
  to	
  almost	
  50%.4-­‐6,8,69,114-­‐116	
  More	
  recently,	
  however,	
  reports	
  have	
  indicated	
  recurrence	
  rates	
  in	
  arthro-­‐scopically	
  treated	
  patients	
  that	
  rival	
  those	
  seen	
  in	
  patients	
  treated	
  with	
  the	
  more	
  traditional	
  open	
  Bankart	
  repairs.106,117,118	
  
Kim	
  and	
  coworkers117	
  have	
  reported	
  a	
  recurrence	
  rate	
  of	
  only	
  4%	
  in	
  167	
  patients	
  followed	
  up	
  at	
  a	
  mean	
  of	
  44	
  months	
  who	
  had	
  a	
  suture

  They	
  cited	
  Rowe	
  scores	
  of	
  excellent	
  or	
  good	
  in	
  95%	
  of	
  patients,	
  with	
  91%	
  of	
  patients	
  able	
  to	
  return	
  to	
  a	
  preinjury	
  levels	
  of	
  activity,	
  and	
  an	
  average	
  loss	
  of	
  only	
  2	
  degrees

  external	
  rotation.	
  Contact	
  athletes	
  who	
  present	
  with	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability	
  represent	
  a	
  very	
  controversial	
  subset	
  of	
  patients.	
  Deciding	
  whether	
  these	
  high	
  demand	
  patients	
  should	
  be	
  managed	
  with	
  open	
  surgical	
  repair	
  instead	
  of	
  arthroscopic	
  repair	
  remains	
  a	
  crux	
  and	
  is	
  debated	
  substantially	
  in	
  the	
  literature.	
  Hubbell	
  and	
  colleagues119	
  have	
  reported	
  on	
  differences	
  in	
  arthroscopic	
  and	
  open	
  repairs	
  in	
  collision	
  athletes	
  and	
  found	
  that	
  6	
  of	
  9	
  such	
  athletes	
  treated	
  arthroscopically	
  experienced	
  “repeat	
  in-­‐stability,”	
  whereas	
  no	
  such	
  patients	
  treated	
  with	
  an	
  open	
  repair	
  developed	
  a	
  recurrence.	
  Although	
  patients	
  treated	
  with	
  an	
  open	
  repair	
  showed	
  a	
  lower	
  rate	
  of	
  recurrence,	
  the	
  patients	
  demonstrated	
  restrictions	
  in	
  their	
  range	
  of	
  motion,	
  particu-­‐larly	
  that	
  of	
  external	
  rotation.	
  Based	
  on	
  their	
  findings,	
  it	
  was	
  recommended	
  that	
  collision	
  athletes	
  suffering	
  from	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  instability	
  should	
  undergo	
  an	
  open	
  repair,	
  whereas	
  athletes	
  whose	
  sport	
  demands	
  a	
  more	
  extensive	
  range	
  of	
  mo-­‐tion,	
  such	
  as	
  swimmers	
  and	
  throwers,	
  should	
  undergo	
  arthroscopic	
  repair.	
  In	
  contrast	
  to	
  the	
  results	
  of	
  this	
  study,	
  other	
  reports	
  have	
  suggested	
  that	
  arthroscopic	
  repair	
  of	
  the	
  unstable	
  glenohumeral	
  joint	
  in	
  collision	
  and	
  contact	
  athletes	
  is	
  an	
  acceptable	
  means	
  of	
  intervention.120,121	
  Burkhart	
  and	
  DeBeer63	
  have	
  described	
  their	
  results	
  for	
  101	
  contact	
  athletes	
  who	
  un-­‐derwent	
  arthroscopic	
  Bankart	
  repairs.	
  Initial	
  review	
  of	
  the	
  results	
  seems	
  to	
  be	
  incomplete,	
  because	
  recurrence	
  rates	
  appear	
  high.	
  However,	
  when	
  the	
  patients	
  are	
  segregated	
  into	
  two	
  cohorts	
  based	
  on	
  anatomic	
  findings—(1)	
  those	
  who	
  demonstrate	
  an	
  engaging	
  Hill-­‐Sachs	
  lesion	
  or	
  an	
  inverted	
  pear	
  glenoid,	
  and	
  (2)	
  those	
  not	
  in	
  the	
  first	
  group—the	
  results	
  are	
  striking.	
  The	
  stratified	
  results	
  showed	
  an	
  87%	
  recurrence	
  rate	
  in	
  group	
  1	
  and	
  only	
  a	
  6.5%	
  recurrence	
  rate	
  for	
  those	
  in	
  group	
  2.	
  Burkhart	
  and	
  DeBeer’s	
  study63	
  has	
  demonstrated	
  the	
  importance	
  of	
  intraoperative	
  decision	
  making	
  that	
  best	
  suits	
  the	
  pa-­‐tient.	
  Although	
  it	
  is	
  not	
  our	
  practice	
  to	
  exclude	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilization	
  before	
  entering	
  the	
  operating	
  room,	
  some	
  have	
  suggested	
  contraindications	
  to	
  this	
  procedure,	
  which	
  include	
  an	
  inverted	
  pear	
  glenoid	
  or	
  an	
  engaging	
  Hill-­‐Sachs	
  lesion,63	
  capsular	
  defects,	
  previously	
  failed	
  open	
  or	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilizations,	
  or	
  previously	
  failed	
  thermal	
  capsulorrhaphy.94,122	
  Ultimately,	
  we	
  believe	
  that	
  we	
  can	
  address	
  anterior	
  instability	
  arthroscopically	
  with	
  equal	
  or	
  greater	
  efficacy	
  than	
  through	
  the	
  use	
  of	
  an	
  open	
  technique	
  for	
  most	
  patients.	
  However,	
  when	
  unable	
  to	
  accomplish	
  a	
  satisfactory	
  stabilization	
  arthro-­‐scopically	
  because	
  of	
  any	
  of	
  the	
  aforementioned	
  contraindications,	
  we	
  do	
  not	
  hesitate	
  to	
  convert	
  to	
  an	
  open	
  procedure.	
  If	
  a	
  patient	
  has	
  an	
  isolated	
  Bankart	
  lesion	
  with	
  unidirectional	
  instability,	
  arthroscopic	
  failure	
  rates	
  today	
  almost	
  match	
  those	
  of	
  open	
  repairs.	
  Failure	
  rates,	
  however,	
  do	
  not	
  match	
  in	
  patients	
  with	
  multidirectional	
  instability.	
  Also,	
  as	
  discussed	
  earlier,	
  closure	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval	
  is	
  an	
  important	
  and	
  useful	
  method	
  for	
  reducing	
  or	
  eliminating	
  capsular	
  redundancy,	
  especially	
  when	
  the	
  patient	
  has	
  an	
  inferior	
  component	
  to	
  their	
  instability.85	
  Millet	
  and	
  colleagues94	
  have	
  also	
  prescribed	
  humeral	
  avulsion	
  of	
  the	
  inferior	
  glenohumeral	
  ligament	
  complex	
  as	
  a	
  poten-­‐tial	
  contraindication	
  to	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilization	
  because	
  of	
  difficulty	
  in	
  accessing	
  the	
  space	
  adequately	
  with	
  current	
  ar-­‐throscopic	
  techniques.	
  Pagnani	
  and	
  Dome110	
  have	
  cited	
  advantages	
  to	
  the	
  open	
  technique,	
  including	
  (1)	
  being	
  able	
  to	
  leave	
  the	
  arm	
  in	
  a	
  position	
  that	
  facilitates	
  surgery	
  without	
  having	
  to	
  worry	
  about	
  losing	
  proper	
  visibility,	
  and	
  (2)	
  better	
  extra-­‐capsular	
  visualization	
  of	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval,	
  with	
  easier	
  access	
  for	
  closure	
  of	
  this	
  space,	
  if	
  necessary.	
  Open	
  technique	
  of-­‐fers	
  access	
  to	
  and	
  visuali-­‐zation	
  of	
  what	
  current	
  arthroscopic	
  techniques	
  cannot	
  encompass,	
  but	
  what	
  future	
  techniques	
  may	
  allow.	
  Subdeltoid Arthroscopic Stabilization Subdeltoid	
  arthroscopy	
  was	
  developed	
  by	
  Stephen	
  J.	
  O’Brien	
  as	
  a	
  means	
  of	
  arthroscopically	
  transferring	
  the	
  long	
  head	
  of	
  the	
  biceps	
  tendon	
  from	
  its	
  intra-­‐articular	
  origin	
  at	
  the	
  supraglenoid	
  tubercle	
  to	
  the	
  extracapsular	
  conjoint	
  tendon	
  on	
  the	
  coracoid	
  process	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐17).123	
  Subdeltoid	
  arthroscopy	
  allows	
  for	
  visualization	
  of	
  many	
  anatomic	
  structures	
  that	
  were	
  once	
  un-­‐viewable	
  arthroscopically	
  in	
  a	
  clear,	
  well-­‐distended	
  field	
  that	
  can	
  be	
  easily	
  maintained	
  through	
  saline	
  insufflation	
  for	
  over	
  2	
  hours	
  if	
  necessary	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐18).	
  Verma	
  and	
  asssociates123	
  have	
  briefly	
  described	
  reaching	
  the	
  subdeltoid	
  space	
  using	
  careful	
  dissection	
  with	
  a	
  mechanical	
  
shaver	
  and	
  a	
  radiofrequency	
  device	
  from	
  the	
  posterior	
  portal	
  after	
  first	
  moving	
  anteriorly	
  through	
  the	
  subacromial	
  space.	
  Within	
  the	
  fascial	
  plane,	
  the	
  subdeltoid	
  space	
  is	
  readily	
  cleared	
  with	
  the	
  same	
  devices	
  (Fig.	
  17-­‐19).	
  The	
  resulting	
  space,	
  now	
  distended	
  with	
  saline,	
  allows	
  direct	
  visualization	
  of	
  many	
  anatomic	
  structures	
  of	
  the	
  anterior	
  shoulder	
  and	
  chest,	
  previously	
  seen	
  only	
  during	
  open	
  procedures,	
  including	
  the	
  coracoid	
  process,	
  conjoint	
  tendon,	
  pectoralis	
  major	
  and	
  minor,	
  anterior	
  cap-­‐sule	
  subscapularis	
  tendon,	
  supraspinatus	
  tendon,	
  and	
  the	
  rotator	
  interval.	
  In	
  addition	
  to	
  reducing	
  the	
  bleeding,	
  scarring,	
  pain,	
  and	
  soft	
  tissue	
  damage	
  associated	
  with	
  open	
  procedures,	
  we	
  believe	
  that	
  when	
  the	
  subdeltoid	
  space	
  is	
  distended	
  with	
  saline,	
  visibility	
  is	
  actually	
  greater	
  than	
  what	
  can	
  be	
  achieved	
  with	
  an	
  open	
  technique	
  because	
  the	
  surgeon	
  can	
  see	
  more	
  normal	
  anatomic	
  relationships.	
  Furthermore,	
  subdeltoid	
  arthroscopy	
  allows	
  the	
  surgeon	
  to	
  perform	
  essentially	
  the	
  same	
  gold	
  stan-­‐dard	
  operation	
  as	
  an	
  open	
  procedure.	
  To	
  date,	
  Dr.	
  O’Brien	
  has	
  performed	
  several	
  virgin	
  and	
  re-­‐vision	
  arthroscopic	
  stabilizations	
  using	
  the	
  subdeltoid	
  space.	
  These	
  are	
  exciting	
  advances;	
  subdeltoid	
  arthroscopy	
  will	
  provide	
  shoulder	
  surgeons	
  with	
  another	
  tool	
  to	
  address	
  an-­‐terior	
  shoulder	
  pathology	
  through	
  less	
  invasive	
  means	
  and	
  obviate	
  the	
  need	
  for	
  open	
  shoulder	
  procedures.	
  REHABILITATION FOLLOWING ANTERIOR STABILIZATION Postoperatively,	
  patients	
  should	
  be	
  given	
  limitations	
  in	
  range	
  of	
  motion	
  for	
  at	
  least	
  3	
  weeks	
  according	
  to	
  the	
  goals	
  set	
  at	
  the	
  time	
  of	
  surgery.	
  Because	
  a	
  baseball	
  pitcher	
  needs	
  greater	
  flexibility	
  of	
  the	
  shoulder	
  than	
  a	
  football	
  linebacker,	
  these	
  two	
  athletes’	
  recoveries	
  should	
  be	
  tailored	
  according	
  to	
  performance	
  needs.	
  The	
  rehabilitative	
  process	
  begins	
  with	
  passive	
  range-­‐of-­‐motion	
  exercises,	
  with	
  progression	
  to	
  active	
  assisted	
  and	
  finally	
  to	
  active	
  range-­‐of-­‐motion	
  and	
  strengthening	
  ex-­‐ercises.	
  Successful	
  rehabilitation	
  often	
  demands	
  the	
  involvement	
  of	
  a	
  physical	
  therapist	
  who	
  is	
  knowledgeable	
  and	
  experi-­‐enced	
  in	
  handling	
  patients	
  who	
  have	
  had	
  recent	
  anterior	
  stabilization	
  procedures.

Auto Crash Reconstruction (ACR) Rebuttals

This is a classical ACR report. The e ngineer makes the classic arguments. You 
will find that these are surprisingly consistent from one report to the next. Once you have written one of these rebuttals, it can be used as a template for future reports. I did get into a bit of math in this report and some may not feel 
comfortable doing so. However, as I men tion to attendees of the Module 2 of 
Whiplash and Brain Injury Traumatology  program, there is plenty to rebut 
outside of the physics and mathematics.

I was brought in as a consultant in this case. This case was, in fact, the subject case of the 2006 Mock Trial, DVDs of which are available from SRISD. As a 
consultant, an expert is ge nerally beyond the range of the discovery process. His 
records can’t be subpoenaed and he can’t be deposed. In this case, in a single 
document, I rebutted the opposing ACR expert and the medical expert, and I offered a risk assessment of the patient. I did not interview he r or examine her.

This gentleman had bilateral shoulder injuries, among others, that the defense 
was contending would have been impossi ble given the collision type, severity, 
etc. in this case. Once again, I rebut ted the engineer/ACR and the medical 
experts. I did speak with Dr. Clearwater, but I did not examine him, so the work 
is best considered a case review.

This is one of a long series of railroad  cases I have been involved with. These 
are Federal cases, so spec ial rules apply—both concerni ng what the plaintiff can 
actually sue for and how the case is handl ed. These are, essentially, cumulative 
trauma cases in their simplest form and, thus, involve a lifetime of medical 
records. I usually start w ith a thorough review of pe rtinent records and then 
arrange them in chronological order. This  is easily done by using a two-column 
table in Microsoft Word , and then going to the S ort function.

This is another one of the railroad ca ses. Although I did meet Mr. Stephano, I 
did not examine him. While this report is rather lengthy, the a dvantage of my in-
depth review was that the other experts in the case working for the plaintiff 
could take advantage of this review. In th ese cases, there were typically at least a 
half a dozen other experts beside myself. As  in other reports, this one required a 
rebuttal of some fairly well-published engineering experts.

This was an interesting case. Labenne tte was a chiropractor who was struck 
from the rear at very high velocit y. Once again, I did only a case review. The 
two factors that wound up being the undoing of this case were, in my view, an unflattering surveillance vide o and an attorney that was not particularly 
effective. Surveillance video is commonl y used in instances where impairments 
are claimed. All one has to do is get the pl aintiff to remark in his deposition that 
he can’t do something and then cap ture him doing that very thing on 
surreptitiously acquired vide otape. The more adamant that he is in his testimony 
that he absolutely, under any circumstan ces, can’t perform the task, the more 
damning is the video. In Dr. Labennette’s case, he claimed not to be unable even 
to take out the trash. On video he was s een not only taking out the trash, but also 
replacing his garage door. During my taped deposition, the deposing attorney 
would not allow me to discuss crash mech anics and forces and, rather than argue 
the point, or have me do it under objection so  that a judge could later rule on the 
question, the plaintiff attorney consented ea rly on and told me not to go into this 
area. I think that was a huge mistake.

There were a couple of special issues in these Federal railroad cases. If one fell 
on the job and was injured, he had work ers compensation like most other jobs. 
He could not sue, however, for cumulative trauma. Most of the plaintiffs in these 
railroad were engineers who had worked for the railroad for many years. Most 
were middle aged males and most had multiple level cervical spine and lumbar spine problems. The job involves coupli ng locomotives in the yard, which is 
essentially a low velocity crash. This is  repeated many times as the train is 
assembled, and the engineer in often in  an awkward position while this takes 
place. Slack also develops in between the cars as they move up and down 
grades. This “slack action” can also result in collision-like forces. Loose 
sections of track and poorly secured seats also produced potentially injurious 
spinal loads. To bring a lawsuit in these cases, one needed to show that 
standards of one kind or another—such as vibration standards or the force 
needed to throw a switch—were violated or not met by the railroad. These train videos were made while on the actual r uns the engineers were exposed to to 
attempt to quantify the loads they experienced during travel.

This was an Australian case and, once again, I did not meet or examine Mr. 
Harvey. This was an interesting case b ecause I had to do some extra digging to 
get details on the two cars since they were Australian models and are not on any 
of my auto databases. The expert for th e defense in this case has a tremendous 
amount of credibility in Australia, ha ving been involved in the government and 
automotive safety business for many years, but, as you can see from my comments, his opinions were not always very well supported, and this probably 
being somewhat charitable. From my di scussions with his lawyers, however, 
this individual generally banks on hi s credentials and usually is rarely 
challenged, so I made a special effort to set the record straight whenever 
possible. Again, it is a fairly comprehensiv e report, but one that  I was able to put 
together using Whiplash in Hypertext  and Plug-ins , so it is certainly not outside 
the capacity for most well-equipped physicians with adequate training, and I was 
well paid for my time.

This is another railroad case. In Fede ral Court cases, Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure Rule 26 provides the require ments of the expert medical report. 
Although most of us do not often find ourselves testifying in Federal Court, that standard is a good framework for any me dical report destined for arbitration, 
mediation, or a courtroom trial. Rule 26 has the following requirements: 
 
1. A compete statement of all of the expert’s opinions in the case. 
2. An explanation of the reasons for those opinions. 
3. A complete list and description of th e materials reviewed (e.g., medical 
records, reports, imaging studies , interviews, examinations, etc). 
4. The exhibits to be used if th e expert testifies at trial. 
5. A list of all of the published material of the expert over the past 10 years. 
6. The qualifications of the expert. 
7. The amount of compensation give n for the work product rendered. 
8. A list of any other cases in which the e xpert has testified in the past four 
years.

Dr. Traffica was injured when he was rear -ended in a parking lot. It was a low 
velocity case, yet he suffered significant injuries, ultimately requiring thoracic outlet surgery and spinal surgery. His outcomes from these procedures were 
fairly good and the case also went extrem ely well for him. Although I did meet 
him on a couple of occasions, I di d not perform an examination.

As is apparent from reading them, the repor ts in this section were generated after 
I had interviewed and examined the patients.  In previous years, my approach to 
range of motion (ROM) testing was to us e a simple goniometer or inclinometers 
and then to rely on Youdas et al. (1) fo r normative data with which to compare 
the patient’s ROM. I plot this using a program called Harvard Chart XL by 
incorporating their published normative da ta regression equations. This way, I 
can plot the age- and sex-adjusted exp ected range against my actual measured 
range and then plot next to  that the percentage of de viation from expected. (Note 
that we sell this software which comes bundled with the files I have 
programmed with these regression equa tions.) These days, I use the JTECH 
Tracker (JTECH Medical) to measure more  precise and reliable ROM, but still 
incorporate this normative regressi on data in the final analysis.

Dr. Rogers was an internist who became 100% disabled following a rear impact 
collision. Because she was a physician, she essentially directed her own care for 
quite some time. She built up a very considerable medical record during that time. But there were no clear answers fo r why she was so severely symptomatic. 
Initially, I was hired to do a record revi ew and overview of the case. After that I 
was deposed. Then, after the deposition, I conducted a full examination of Dr. 
Rogers and rendered the report below. In this first report, I was able to find a nearly identical crash using NHTSA’s NASS database. That allowed my to 
derive a crash delta V wit hout having to resort to  a lot of estimation or 
guesswork. This kind of qualitative reconstruction is very handy when it can be done. If you cannot find a good match using the database, you can still often bracket between representative crashes with less and greater property damage 
than the subject crash, providing you a range of likely crash metrics.

Lingering questions remained in this case. The cervical SPECT study was not 
definitive for trauma and could have been related to degenerative changes. MRI was equivocal to a degree. The dynamic sEMG was clearly abnormal and that 
was what convinced me that this woman really had a problem. Also notice that 
none of the outcome questionnaires i ndicated any symptom magnification or 
malingering. I discussed the possibility of  a discogram with Dr. Rogers and she 
had one a week after I saw her. These are not only highly invasive, but also 
somewhat controversial and I rarely orde r them. It was, nevertheless, highly 
abnormal. The case settled shortly thereafter.

This case began for me as a typical one, from the perspective of a motor vehicle 
crash injury, with a set of injuries that were somewhat unclear or uncertain. The patient had an unusual personality and lif estyle which complicated the picture. 
Ultimately, Mr. Barker’s big day wa s the date of his high-low binding 
arbitration. The arbitrator, a retired judge, ran the ar bitration in an unusually 
confrontational format by having me face off first with the defense accident 
reconstructionist and later the defense orthopaedic surgeon. One of the critical 
questions in this case was whether Mr. Barker had been wearing his seat belt 
and shoulder harness at the time of the cr ash because his head  clearly contacted 
and broke the windshield in this head-on collision. If he wasn’t wearing his 
restraints, his contributory negligence would mean an award toward the “low” 
end of the agreed upon arbitration range. The defense reconstructionist pointed 
out that the Federal Motor Vehicle Sa fety Standard (FMVSS) 208—the 30 mph 
frontal barrier compliance test that all ca rs must pass to be sold in the U.S.—
resulted in delta Vs. of 30+ mph. And in these crashes, belted dummies virtually 
never contact the windshield. In the case of Mr. Barker’s collision, he continued, the delta V would have been only in the range of 17 mph, and I did not disagree 
with that figure. The conclusion, he poin ted out, could only be that Mr. Barker 
had not been using his restra ints at the time. I think that the critical piece of 
evidence in this case were the photos I ha d taken of Mr. Barker in his car. He 
had his seat adjusted in an extremel y forward position. Combined with his 
height of over 6 ft, this placed his head in close proximity to the windshield. And unlike rigid HIII dummies, his fl exible torso would allow additional 
forward and axial movement of his head in such a crash. As for the FMVSS 208 argument, I pointed out that it was not re levant in this case, because 208 requires 
the seat to be placed in the mid-rail pos ition: Mr. Barker’s was in a forward rail 
position. The arbitrator, I suspect, was im pressed with my photos and mentioned 
them at least three time during the time I was there. He said to the defense reconstructionist, “Yes, but did you look at  Dr. Croft’s photographs? It looks to 
me as though the head gets pretty close to the windshield even with the belts 
on.” He awarded the maximum award to the plaintiff.

This report was never finished due to the haste with which all parties were 
moving and the late timing of my examin ation. I was just finishing it when the 
deposition was called. I have included it because of the use of the NASS database material, which is not familiar to many. I was deposed on this case and the case later settled “on the steps of the courthouse.” Once again, this NASS 
qualitative reconstruction allows us to  estimate crash velocity based on the on-
site reconstruction by trained NHTSA i nvestigators of similar collisions 
involving the same kinds of vehicles in which the resulting property damage is 
comparable. Often this allows us to establish that the collision forces were in excess of the thresholds of injury postulated by the defense.

Here is another classic low velocity rear impact collision. The victim was 
stopped at a traffic signal and was struck  from the rear, with minimal resulting 
property damage. Ms. Rallsaff was, per my recommendation, seen for surgical 
consultation and did undergo three epidural  steroid injections with equivocal 
results. The report you see here was a s econdary report to the Department of 
Social Services to secure Ms. Rallsaff So cial Security benefits. This case also 
settled out of court.

This was a relatively high speed collision in which liability was not contested. 
Complicating the picture was Mr. South’s prior surfing injury many years earlier 
which had resulted in an “autofusion ” in the cervical spine and his ongoing, 
albeit intermittent, chiropractic manage ment since that time. Mr. South also 
received a fairly extensiv e series of epidural and other injections from Dr. 
Rosenblum, and the need for these was contested. In addition to his neuromusculoskeletal complaints, a significant cognitive and neuroendocrinological component was present.  
 
 
Medical Malpractice 
G o l d f i n g e r . P D F          2 6 5  
 
As is often the case, people who present for chiropractic or medical care are already sick in some way, so their de terioration is sometimes inevitable. Many 
who seek chiropractic care already ha ve herniated a disc. In a medical 
malpractice claim, however, it is necessa ry to demonstrate that the doctor’s 
treatment (or lack of it) in some way precipitated this decline and that the 
treatment (or lack thereof) fell below th e “standard of care in the community.” 
This term is sometimes a slippery one to  define. I published the results of a very 
large survey of chiropractic physicians a decade ago to attempt to define the 
standard of care concerning manipulation of suspected or confirmed cervical 
disc herniations. [Note that standard of  care is not necessarily synonymous with 
optimal care—it is simply the standard approach used by the majority in a 
population of practitioners.] More than 90% of the 5,000 plus respondents to my survey stated that they would use manipul ation in these cases. Thus, the standard 
of care in the community of chiropractor s in the U.S. is such that, with 
appropriate precautions, cervical adjustme nts are considered an acceptable and 
appropriate treatment in pe rsons known to have, or suspected to have, cervical 
herniations (2). For many things, howeve r, no such standard has been examined, 
so these questions more often become th e grist to be wrangled over by opposing 
medicolegal experts. 
 
If a doctor’s management cannot be shown to have fallen below the standard of care in the community, it is very difficu lt to argue neglig ence, regardless of 
damages. My job in this case, was to de termine whether the standard of care was 
violated in some fashion. To that end, af ter reviewing all of the documents in the 
case, I set forth a series of reasons why I did not feel the standard been breached. 
As is very often the case, after sendi ng off this report, I heard nothing more 
about it. But several years later, I happened  to run into Dr. Goldfinger’s wife at a 
seminar in Los Angeles and she told me that after my report was reviewed, the 
plaintiff dropped her claim.

RE: Reconstruction of motor vehicle crash (MVC) of March 31, 1996: Christina Dawn 
and John Tennison. 
 
Dear Ms. Rallings: 
 
I have reviewed the report of J. Ronald  Spalding, P.E., date d 3-22-99, in which he 
attempted to define some of the likely crash parameters of the above mentioned motor 
vehicle crash (MVC) and then compared them to some everyday experiences. In the first 
part of this report I will comment on Mr. Spal ding’s report. In the second part I will 
address the issue of the potential for or probability of inju ry and poor outcome—a subject 
tacitly addressed by Mr. Spalding. 
 
Mr. Spalding’s Analysis 
 
Mr. Spalding conducted his analysis of th e MVC in question by relying on photographs 
of the two vehicles and a statement by a passeng er in vehicle two (V2). Apparently he did 
not interview the drivers or occupants. He al so apparently did not have access to medical 
records, past medical histor y, or reports of injury.  
 
Mr. Spalding calculated the crash para meters, including change of momentum 
(designated  in his report (d)mV), change of velocity (designated in his report (d)V), and acceleration (Accel. in his repor t). He concluded that the (d)mV for both vehicles was 
253 lb-sec. This figure was derived from the product of the assumed duration of the crash 
(0.250 sec) and a figure reportedl y representing a force estimate d, in this case, as 1013 lb, 
and reported to be equivalent to the am ount of property damage sustained by V2. 
 
From this figure Mr. Spalding subsequently derived a velocity change for V2 of 3.49 
ft/sec (2.38 mph) and an acceleration of 0.4 g. He then pointed out that the occupants of a 
vehicle will be accelerated to the same degree as that of the vehicle and that this was 
“categorically true” if the occupants are secure ly attached to the vehicle via seat backs, 
seat belts, and “headrests.” 
 
Mr. Spalding then alluded to a study (w hich he did not cite specifically) which 
demonstrated that certain everyday occurrences , such as a “slap on the back,” result in  
 
head accelerations ranging from 0.5  g to 2.7 g. Thus, he noted, the forces experienced by 
the occupants of V2 were “within the leve ls normally experienced by individuals in

everyday life,” presumably implying that th e crash would have been benign and not 
capable of producing injury. 
 
Problems identified in the Spalding report: 
 
The following are what I consider problematic  points in Mr. Spaldi ng’s analysis of the 
MVC in question. 
 
1. Several published papers have shown that most production cars and light trucks and 
vans are capable of with standing bumper-to-bumper impacts of up to 8-10 mph 
without sustaining permanent damage ( 53h,96i,96j,96k). In making estimations about 
crash parameters one needs to consider crash damage to both vehicles. From his 
statements, Mr. Spalding based all of his cal culations only on the apparent damage to 
V2—clearly an erroneous methodology and ignor ing any forces from V1. Even in the 
absence of any residual damage to V1, all that can be said is that it experienced some 
speed change below the damage threshold, wh ich, for a van of this size against a 
softer portion of a much smaller vehicl e would have been at least 5-8 mph. One 
cannot ignore this energy merely on the basis of an absence of residual crush. 
2. The derivation of this figure of 1013 l b, which Mr. Spalding has used in his 
calculations, and which he described at one point as a measurement of “force” and at another point as an “impulse ,” is not explained. I am not  aware of any method that 
would allow one to make such an estimation. For example, barrier equivalent velocity (BEV) equations are based on empirically derived formulas, but are based on higher 
speed (30 mph) barrier crashes and have no validity in low speed crashes. Nor has 
there been any crash testing using the vector s of crash unique to this MVC, and with 
such disparate vehicle masses, to allow a ny such prediction that I am aware of. The 
van, for example, has a mass approxima tely twice that of the Saturn.  
3. Momentum is equivalent to the product of mass and velocity and is expressed as lb 
ft/sec (momentum (p)=mv). The units for ch ange of momentum would have the same 
value. From momentum we can calculate ve locity (v=p/m). Moreover, at best, when 
used in low speed accident reconstruction, it allows only a very crude estimate of 
forces. Common sense would suggest that we conduct a sensitivity analysis: basing all calculations on a 
range  of probable collision forces which would likely include the 
correct value. It is important  to keep the imprecise nature  of such calculations in mind 
so that one avoids the illusion of highe r precision as occurs when reporting, for 
example, answers to the second decimal poi nt, or values in odd numerical terms 
which sound conspicuously “unestimated,” such as 1013 lb. In addition to this 1013 
figure, Mr. Spalding did not explain his derivation of velocity change, but his 
methodologies appear to have been the following: 
 
dv v v vFt
mcarbg==′−=ΔΔ      eq. 1 
 
where (d)v is the change of velocity, F ΔV is the impulse, and m car is the mass of the 
car. From this he calculated a car mass: 
 
Tennison-Dawn 
Page 3 of 10 
wmg mw
gcar car car =× = = =   and  2334
32 272 48..   eq. 2 
 
where pounds of force (2334) is divided by g giving pounds of mass (72.48). 
Returning then to equation 1: 
 
Ft
mlbf
lbmfps
carΔ==1013 0 25
72 48349.s e c
..b g     eq. 3 
 
While momentum equations can be used in  the calculation of relatively in-line 
collisions between two vehicl es, the units generally used are the weights of the two 
involved vehicles , not weights representing some  degree of resulting damage 
(however that figure might be derived). This equation for conser vation of momentum 
is: 
 
mv mv mv mv11 2 2 11 2 2+=+' '     eq. 4 
 
where m1 represents the mass of V1 before the collision, v1 represents the velocity of 
V1 before the collision, and so on. The pr ime sign (‘) indicates the after-accident 
condition. Notice that the equa tion considers the relative ma sses of the both vehicles. 
In accident reconstruction we often consid er weight to be synonymous with mass ( m) 
for practical purposes.  
4. The assumed duration of the collision, how ever, is an important factor in the 
estimation of acceleration with  the relationship being: 
 
adV
dtaV
t==bgbg or Δ
Δ      eq. 5 
 
Thus, although I question the accuracy of th e derivation of Mr. Spalding’s  3.49 ft/sec 
figure based on the dubious derivation of  the 1013 figure, the acceleration is 
otherwise correctly calculated  as (Accel.)=3.49/0.250=13.98 ft/sec2 or 0.4 g 
(13.98/32.2). While it is true that the duration of this low speed co llision is in the 
neighborhood of 0.250 sec as Mr. Spalding s uggests, the duration of the occupant 
loading is probably in the or der of only 0.10 to 0.12 sec at most, based on the results 
of many crash tests that have been conduc ted. The primary occupant motion durations 
don’t usually exceed 120 msec in low speed crashes. And, since it is the occupant 
forces that we are concerned with, this will change the calculated acceleration value as follows: 
 
af t o r ==349
012029 0 92 .
./s e c  .  g 
 
Also I’m afraid Mr. Spalding is “categoric ally incorrect” in his assertion that the 
occupant’s speed change and acceleration are th e same as the vehicle’s. In fact, it has 
Tennison-Dawn 
Page 4 of 10 
been known since the late 1950s, since the first early full scale crash tests of Severy et 
al. (50-52), that the acceleration of the occ upant’s head is typica lly 2.5 times that of 
the vehicle in low speed crashes. This re lationship has been found to be the case in 
nearly all human volunteer crash tests since that time (53g-53k,473). Moreover, in 
this particular crash scenar io the occupant kinematics w ould be such that Dr. Lynn 
Tennison would initially be thrown forward and obliquely toward the left. Neither her 
seat back nor head restraint would offer any protection from this forward motion. As 
for the issue of the seat belt, the evidence that these systems actually increase the risk 
of injury in low speed crashes is extensive ( 12,68,69,73,74,79-93f,97a,475,476,478-482 ). 
Thus, none of Mr. Spalding’s statements are true, and are in contravention to a very 
large body of scientific a nd clinical literature. 
5. Mr. Spalding provided an acceleration value for average  acceleration as can only be 
derived from the equation he used ( eq. 5). Thus, the figure repr esents the acceleration 
averaged over the entire dur ation of the crash sequence. However, it is well known 
that the peak  acceleration forces the occupant is  subjected to in these low speed 
crashes is many times higher than calculat ed averages using this method. Since his 
ultimate purpose was to describe injury potential, where only peak values are meaningful, citing average valu es understates the problem and is clearly misleading.  
6. Mr. Spalding was undoubtedly referring to a seriously flawed paper by Allen et al. 
(102a) when he compared being slapped on the back with the forces sustained in this 
MVC. If this is indeed the work he’s referr ing to, it is no surprise that he did not cite 
it. I am quite familiar with this work which can only charitably be described as unscientific. Dr. Allen and his colleagues m easured very brief peaks of acceleration 
occurring as subjects were jostled in a crowd, or plopped into chairs, etc. The very 
brief spikes of acceleration measured were of  such a short duration that injury did not 
result. Unfortunately, there is no comparis on between these forces  and the relatively 
longer duration acceleration of a MVC. Th ese tests bear no resemblance to MVC 
forces in any scientific or meaningful way. For example, unlike the case in MVC, 
essentially no ΔV results from being slapped on the back, which is precisely the 
reason that no injury results from it. The authors offered no explanation or rationale 
for such a meaningless comparison. My coll eagues and I have recently described the 
methodological flaws of this paper and others of its genre (498). 
 
My analysis of this MVC 
 
I reviewed the report of Mr. Spalding, the Report of Accident Claim  dated 4-25-96, 
photocopies of photographs of both vehicles, and a “Visible Collision Quotation” from 
Superior Auto Body dated 4-3-96. I also interviewed Dr. Tennison by telephone on 4-26-
99. In order to realistic ally estimate the forces involve d in this collision, lacking any 
reliable or validated method of damage analysis in this type of crash, we simply start with 
a vehicle dynamics equation: 
 
Ve Vi ad=−22       eq. 6   
 
where Vi is initial velocity and Ve is ending velocity; a represents acceleration and d 
represents distance. From the descripti on of the accident on the form dated 4-25-96, 
Tennison-Dawn 
Page 5 of 10 
signed by Lynn Tennison, D.C., and entitled “R eport of Accident Claim,” the initial 
distance separating the two vehi cles was reported to be approximately 5 ft. An average 
value for a vehicle accelerating from an  initially stopped pos ition is 8-10 ft/sec2. Since 
V1 was backing up, I will assume a somewhat slower acceleration of 5 ft/sec2. 
Substituting, we would have: 
 
Ve=− −02 5 52bg b gbg 
 
or 7 ft/sec (4.8 mph). This figure re presents the closing velocity ( vc) since V2 was 
stationary at the time. In higher speed crashe s (i.e., those with cl osing speeds of over 10 
mph), the coefficient of restitution ( e) can generally be safely ignored. However, in lower 
speed crashes, where residual crush damage is  minimal or nonexistent, it is clear from 
numerous crash studies that e cannot be ignored (575,576) due to the elastic nature of 
these collisions. We can account for e using the following equations:  
 
Δ

or, having calculated Δv1, Δv2 can be simply calculated by: 
 
Δvm
mv21
21=Δ       eq. 9  
 
Note that the term ΔV (or Δ v) is synonymous with Mr. Spalding’s term (d)v, and the 
weights in these equations are given in  kg (V2=1061 kg; V2=2126 kg). Based on known 
crash tests, the value of e is probably about 0.6 under these circumstances. These 
calculations would then yield a Δv1 of 3.7 ft/sec (2.5 mph) and a Δv2 of 7.5 ft/sec (5 mph). 
We can also perform a sensitivity analys is. Allowing for a range of values for e of 0.4 to 
0.8, which certainly would contain the true value, the range of Δv2 would be from 4.4 
mph to 5.7 mph. Conversely, the range of Δv1 would have been only from 2.2 mph to 2.9 
mph, owing to that vehicle’s larger mass. This would greatly reduce the perception of 
crash severity and the likelihood of  injury to its occupants.  
 
One could similarly employ a range of vc based on variances of in tervehicle distances and 
accelerations (eq. 6), but the figures used here are probably already conservative since 
most drivers tend to underestimate close dist ances between their ca rs and others and a 
longer distance figure would give a higher vc value. Also, it is just as likely that the true 
acceleration factor was somewhat highe r, which would also increase the vc value. Even 
shortening the distance by a couple of feet or  decreasing the acceleration factor would not 
produce figures significantly lower.

In order to estimate the linear acceleration of the occupants in the vehicle, we can use   
eq. 5 above: 
 
aV
t=Δ
Δ       eq. 5 
 
Assuming a value for Δt of 0.12 sec (which is also conser vative: the true value is likely 
between 0.10 and 0.12) and our range of Δv2 values, the range of average acceleration 
factors for the occupants would be from 1.7  g to 2.2  g. However, recall that the head 
linear acceleration figures for occupants in low speed crashes are much higher that that of 
the vehicle. For example, Siegmund et al. (497) measured peak head accelerations from 6.7 g to 12.0 g in the 5 mph tests.  In the recent van den Kroonenberg et al. (470) study, 
where subjects were exposed to speed cha nges of 4-6 mph, head linear accelerations 
ranged from 6-12 g, with a mean of 9 g. Notably, Dolinis (467) calculated an odds ratio 
(OR) of 2.08 for risk of injury being female, indicating females carry about two times the risk of males.  
 
Most of the recent crash tests have reported an actual injury threshold (i.e., volunteers 
were injured under accurately measured  laboratory conditions) of 5 mph ( ΔV) 
(53h,53j,53k,53l,473). However, these studies have  been hampered by small sample size, 
the effect of anticipat ion of volunteers, and the fact th at very few subjects have been 
female, despite the fact that the female injury  incidence is significantly greater than that 
of males. The Brault et al. (468) study empl oyed 20 males and 20 females seated in ideal 
positions. At a Δ V of 2.5 mph, 29% sustained injury and at a ΔV of 5 mph 38% sustained 
injury. 
 
Numerous scientific studies (both longitudi nal and retrospective) have identified a 
number of risk factors for acute injury and poor outcome in these low speed crashes. Included among them are female gender (69,106-108,464,467,470,475,476,482,513,514), history of neck injury (467), non-awaren ess of impending impact (96l,101j,467), and 
crash speed under 10 mph (49h) for acute injury. Also identified as factors increasing the 
risk of acute injury are the so-called out-of-position occupant, in which the occupant is either leaning forward or tw isted in the seat (53a,63,99a ,100b-100e), and the effect of 
increased biomechanical disadvantage from havi ng the head turned at impact (73h). Both 
conditions are simulated to a degree in situations where occupants are in normal seating positions, but are subjected to oblique impact vectors as was the case in this MVC. Yet 
another risk factor identified is that associated with the disparity in vehicle masses. The 
risk of injury to occupants in smaller vehicles  increases when the crash is with vehicle of 
greater mass (i.e., ≥ 25% greater) (559,560). In  this case, the other vehicle was 100% 
larger. 
 
For poor outcome, risk factors include immediat e/early onset of symptoms (i.e., within 12 
hours) and/or severe initial sympto ms (98a,109a,166b,284l,284n,482), past history of 
neck pain (109a) or headache ( 284l), and loss or reversal of cervical lordosis (169r). 
When occupants have one or more of these ri sk factors, the threshold for injury becomes 
significantly lower: certainly below the re ported 2.5 mph speed change threshold. Dr. 
Tennison-Dawn 
Page 7 of 10 
Tennison has all of the risk factors menti oned above. Thus, considering the balance of 
scientific knowledge availabl e, and the range of speed changes calculated (4.4 mph to 5.7 
mph), one has to conclude that her actual ri sk of injury in this  MVC was quite high, as 
was her risk for poor outcome (i .e., long-term symptomatology). 
 
Conclusions 
 
In my opinion, Mr. Spalding’s report is both inaccurate and misleading. His unexplained 
assumption of 1013 lb of force—on which all other calculations are based—is highly 
dubious and his assumption of a duration of  0.25 sec is incorrectly applied in the 
calculation of occupant loads. His conclusi ons are based on incomplete information, are 
not scientifically supported and, in nearly all cases, are errone ous and in direct conflict 
with our current knowledge and the balance of scientific literature. The probable range of 
speed change to which the vehicle Dr. Tenni son was in was subjected to was from 4.4 
mph to 5.7 mph, which is well in excess of the range known to cause injury—even in 
adult healthy males under ideal laboratory conditions and in the absence of injury risk 
factors. Dr. Tennison, however,  had several such risk factors which would only have 
served to lower the threshold of injury and increased the chance of poor outcome risk in 
her case. Although I have not examined Dr . Tennison, it is my understanding that she 
does suffer from ongoing pain and dysfunction of the type that is typical for such an 
injury mechanism and, at the very least, one certainly cannot argue that injury in such a 
crash would have been unlikely. In point of f act, it was quite likely. And the same is true 
of poor outcome.

RE: Accident Reconstruction of Collision of Natalie Almond and Medical Report 
 
Dear Mr. Xxxxxx:  
 
I have reviewed the report of the accident reconstruction of the collision of December 22, 
2001 conducted by John Howard of Reconstructions LTD . This unsigned 17-page report, 
which I will hereafter attribute to  Mr. Howard, is dated July 1, 2004. 
 
Mr. Howard draws the following conclusions: 
 
1. Damage to the rear of the Chevrolet Tahoe is consistent with the impact as 
described. 
2. The maximum speed change for the Chevrolet Tahoe was 6.08 mph. 
3. Injury to the Tahoe’s occupants would have been “very unlikely.” 
 
Mr. Howard reportedly based his conclusions on the following 
material: 
 
1. A review of the “T/C” report. 
2. Three actual photographs of the targ et vehicle, a 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe. 
3. A review of 10 photocopies of phot ographs of the same vehicle. 
4. A review of three copies of the repair estimate for the Chevrolet Tahoe (It is not 
clear from this document whether he saw an actual repair bill). 
5. A review of medical records from Drs.  Bergstrom, Goldsmith, and Nakagawa. 
6. A review of an insurance investigation file. 
7. A review of the deposition of Ms. Almond. 
 
Despite listing the foregoing documents, Mr . Howard offered no further comment on 
items #1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the above list. Thus it is not possible to determine how—if at 
all—any of these records might have influen ced his conclusions in this case. It is 
noteworthy that Mr. Howard describes himsel f as an accident reconstructionist on his 
stationery but does not list his academic degr ees. Presumably, he is not a physician and it 
is doubtful that any of his conclusions that ar e based on his review of  medical records are 
qualified. Mr. Howard offered no further comm ent or insight into the “T/C” report. 
According to his report, the police did not complete a tra ffic collision report, so the

The theoretical underpinnings for his opinions are further based on two papers he cited incompletely on page 4 of his report. The title of the first was, Low speed rear-end 
collision testing using human subjects. The authors of this paper purportedly established  a threshold of injury on the basis of head  acceleration which is given as 14 g. I am 
familiar with this paper which was published by West et al. (1) and suffers from a number of methodological and theo retical flaws. For example, a ll of the subjects in these 
tests were male, so extrapolation to female subjects is not justifiable on scientific grounds, especially since it has been shown in nearly every outcome study published over 
the past 20 years that females are at twice th e risk for injury as males in rear impact 
crashes. Moreover, the authors—who were not physicians—measured head acceleration 
using a hockey helmet with accelerometers attached, as opposed to a more secure, tight headband with triaxial array of accelerometers to measure the accelera tion at the center of 
gravity of the head. Because the head and helmet can (and in these tests did) move 
independently at the point of  head restraint contact, ar tifacts of the acceleration-time 
history are introduced and, in fact, were likely maximized at  the very point of maximal 
head/head restraint engagement—a point that also coincides with peak head acceleration. 
Thus, the accuracy and reliability of the West  et al. acceleration da ta was dubious at best. 
Moreover, no statistical methodology was empl oyed in this study to determine whether 
any reported thresholds were reliable, repeatable, or gene ralizable to the population of 
real world subjects at risk, nor  did the authors offer any plau sible explanation as to how 
they determined this threshold to be 14 g. We have produced neck injuries in healthy 
male subjects exposed to 11 g. Moreover,  many other biomechanical factors are 
important when attempting to predict injury. 
 
The second paper, which is mentioned w ithout title, alludes to a chair-plopping 
experiment and this paper can be identified as one by Allen et al. (2). This paper is more 
egregiously flawed than the first from both a methodological and theoretical standpoint. 
Chair plopping bears virtually no similarity to rear impact  crash testing and any such 
correlations between them are patently specious. The vector s are not comparable, nor is 
the duration of acceleration or the change in  velocity. Both are extremely important 
known risk variables in terms if  whiplash injury. The predictions of safety in low speed 
collisions that are drawn from  chair plopping in a laboratory ar e roughly the equivalent of 
drawing one’s finger quickly over a flame and concluding that fire is not harmful to 
human flesh.  
 
The paper by Allen et al. shares  the unique attributes  of being one of the most lamentable 
misadventures in science to be published on th e subject of whiplash in the past 20 years 
(and is rarely referenced by serious sc ientists) while enjoying huge popularity among 
accident reconstructionists. It is noteworthy that it is the single most commonly cited paper in accident reconstruction reports in my  experience. These two papers exist with a 
genre of “literature” that has been widely debunked, yet remains popular among those eager to dismiss rear end coll isions and non-harmful (3). It is not surprising that these

papers are so often camouflaged, as seen in Mr. Howard’ report, rather than being correctly cited. 
 
Neither of these papers offer any real support or foundation for Mr. Howard conclusions in this case. In point of fact , injuries have been reported in  low speed crash tests at head 
accelerations lower than 14 g (5-9), and some researchers (including West et al.) have concluded that the risk thres hold on the basis of delta V is  approximately 5 mph (1,5-7) 
and, more recently, as low as 2.5 mph. Moreover,  there is no reliable way to reconstruct 
crashes using photos of a single vehicle. The maximum crash speed reported here to the 
hundredth of a mph is patently absurd in its veneer of precision. In truth, the best any 
skilled reconstructionist could hope to achieve in such a case would be to express the 
estimate as a whole number, plus or minus  1-2 mph. In the only published validation 
study of its kind, this form of accident r econstruction was shown to be relatively 
unreliable, with reconstructions who estimated  crash speed from a single vehicle set of 
photographs endorsing ranges from a low of  6-10 mph to a high of 26-30 mph, with 
rather broad distribution (4). Their ability to accurately es timate the actual crush depth 
from these photographs was also poor, with participants estimati ng on average 13.6 in of 
crush, but with large a standard deviation of  4.2 in. This demonstrates a low degree of 
precision and reliability.  
 
Using the results of the aut hors’ one-photograph reconstruc tion, the amount of kinetic 
energy of a 1000 lb nominal vehicle can be shown to vary by as much as 2400% across 
the range of their data, making such e ndeavors a crude estimation at best. And 
reconstruction of crashes based on crush data is widely known to be unreliable at lower 
speeds, even when this can be measured accurately by direct inspecti on of the vehicle(s) 
(10). Moreover, such reconstruction is te nuous at best when only one vehicle is 
accounted for, as is the case here. Mr. Howard  appears to have had no information about 
the state of the bullet vehicle after the crash. There also was no mention of whether either 
vehicle was fitted with an Event Data Recorder (EDR), although GM has placed them in some models since 1990. Recorded data woul d allow for a more reliable crash metric 
estimation. There is also no mention of whet her the Tahoe had a trailer hitch. These can 
increase the transfer of energy in rear impact crashes and heig hten the risk for injury (11). 
 
The crash scenario in this case is complicated by the fact that both vehicles were in motion at the moment of impact and that th ere was some element of misalignment of the 
vehicles, as the bullet was moving to the right and struck the left rear of the target vehicle. This would likely have introduced an element of asymmetric motion and shear 
across the disc spaces and facet joints of the target vehicle occupants. Mr. Howard did not offer any insight into how he accounted for these pre-impact motions. He provided no 
mathematical details of his analysis in terms of delta V or acceleration.  
 
Mr. Howard pointed out, on page 3 of his repor t, that the Tahoe’s bumper is designed to 
“absorb the shock of an impact of up to 5 mph.” This comment, however, is misleading. The 5 mph bumper standard requires that th e vehicle contact a rigid barrier at 5 mph. 
Whether damage of any kind is permissible in such tests varies over the years. However, 
ALMOND, Natalie 
Page 4 of 10 
 
 
the notion that the shock of an impact will be absorbed is patently incorrect as far as the 
occupant is concerned. Our cras h testing and that of others  clearly demonstrates that 
significant forces can be transferred to a car ’s occupants in crashes in which no bumper 
damage occurs and in which injuries have  been reported (9,12). The federal bumper 
regulation contains no wording regarding shock attenuation or reduction of injury risk to 
occupants. I would also point out  that crash test research has frequently demonstrated that 
when two 5 mph-rated bumpers collide, cr ash speeds of 10 mph or more are often 
possible in which no bumper damage occu rs. Moreover, a 5 mph bumper does not 
necessarily crush at 5.1 mph: many can w ithstand much higher impacts. We have 
subjected numerous vehicles to multiple cr ashes in the 5-10 mph range and produced no 
structural damage. This may be a moot poi nt, however, if there was not significant 
bumper to bumper contact as Mr . Howard seems to be reporting. 
 
On page 4, Mr. Howard reasoned that, since the average duration of a rear impact crash is 
0.10 seconds, the “average G force effected on the driver,” could be “as high as 2.77 g.” 
Notwithstanding my hesitance to accept hi s 6.08 mph delta V estimation, this value of 
2.77 g is obtained by dividing the delta V (in fps) by 0.1 and then diving that value by 
32.2 fps2 to convert the accelerati on into the more familiar gravitational (g) units. The 
equation is: 
 
2 8.9489.37 2.770.1secvat
fpsaf psΔ=Δ
== = g 
 
In which a is acceleration, Δv is delta V, or change in velocity, and Δt is the duration (in 
seconds) of the crash. This again is an obf uscation because it provides us only with an 
average acceleration of the vehicle. It has long been established that the acceleration of 
the occupant’s head will be a multiple of the vehicle’s acceleration as a result of head 
restraint contact and torso overspeed resul ting from the dynamics (e.g., coefficient of 
restitution) of the seat back and, further, th at the peak acceleration of the human head will 
nearly always exceed the aver age acceleration (13). Peak acc eleration, of course, is a 
more meaningful value to consider in fo rensic medicine since it is at the peak 
acceleration where injury is most likely. In actu al rear impact crash tests, we generally 
measure peak acceleration values that are 2-6 times higher than the average vehicle 
values as Mr. Howard has estimated here. Si nce Mr. Howard has mentioned the West et 
al. study, I would hasten to add that I develope d a regression equation from their raw data 
years ago which takes the form: 
 
0.165 1.302yx=+  
 
in which y  represents head acceleration and x represents crash (i.e., closing) velocity. 
Taking the reported delta V of 6.08 mph and cons idering that the cras h velocity required 
to produce that speed change would have b een 2-4 mph higher, one can estimate a head 
linear acceleration of up to 13 g in this 6.08 mph crash based on the West et al. data—
ALMOND, Natalie 
Page 5 of 10 
 
 
well within the range we have measured in actu al crash tests at that speed. The reader is 
to be reminded, however, that the West et al . volunteers were all males and that females 
will generally experience hi gher head accelerations than males under the same crash 
conditions (12). 
 
All of this may be moot in any case, since there have never been any studies that have 
attempted to establish risk thresholds for female drivers of cars that are struck from the rear on the basis of either delta  V or head linear acceleration. 
 
Mr. Howard has provided several pages of printouts from the Expert Autostats database 
for the subject vehicles, although he has not ma de specific mention of that data. Notably, 
however, the bullet vehicle is a pickup truck, which are known for their high stiffness and 
it has a significantly greater mass than the Ta hoe target vehicle. Based on principles of 
conservation of linear momentum, this results  in a relatively greater speed change and 
acceleration for the struck ve hicle. It is also noteworthy that the bumper height 
measurements for the front bumper of the pi ckup and rear bumper of the Tahoe would 
result in fairly good contact vertically, which would tend to result in greater transfer of 
energy than if the bumpers did not align. I cannot comment on the de gree of horizontal 
bumper contact, if any, since I have not seen the photographs of the two vehicles. 
 
Notably not reviewed or mentioned in  this report we re the following 
physical items: 
 
1. Repair estimates or actual repair bills for the target vehicle, a 1994 Chevrolet 
pickup truck. 
2. Photographs of photocopies of photographs of that vehicle. 
 
Insurance Institute For Highway Safety Ratings 
 
The Insurance Institute For Highway Safety (IIHS) has rated the 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe 
head restraint as “poor,” indicating that the head restraint and seat  back design provide 
suboptimal head restraint geometry and are inadequately designed to protect occupants 
from rear impact crash injury. The IIHS has not rated the rear bumper of the this vehicle, but has rated the 1995-2004 Chevrolet Blazer’s bumper as “poor.” The Blazer and Tahoe share many structural components. 
 
 
Conclusions Regarding the Howard Report 
 
The values provided by Mr. Howard for delta V and head linear ac celeration are based on 
methodologies that have been re cently proven to be unreliabl e and inaccurate and, as far 
ALMOND, Natalie 
Page 6 of 10 
 
 
as I am aware, there have never been a ny validation studies th at have offered any 
evidence that these methods are  valid. Nevertheless, such methods are in common use 
among accident reconstructionists today. This is at best a physics of guesswork and 
should not be accorded substantial probative va lue in a forensic applications in cases 
involving crash speeds below 20 mph or so.  
 
Mr. Howard has also not demonstrated or e xplained how he might have dealt with the 
other complicating issues of collision vector s and pre-crash motions in his analysis, 
making his conclusions all the more impugnable.  Mr. Howard conclusions regarding risk 
for injury are unsupported on the basis of this dubious accuracy or reliability of his estimates of crash metrics and on the basis that no risk threshold for injury has ever been 
established, scientifically, for male or female  subjects of target vehicles. Mr. Howard is 
not apparently a physician, and is not trained or  qualified to review medical records. He 
has not considered the most significant risk fa ctors for neck injury. I will do that below. 
 
 
Report of Frank A. Nakagawa, MD 
 
I have reviewed the report of Frank A. Nakagawa, MD (orthopedi c surgeon) addressed 
“to whom it may concern,” dated April 8, 2003. Dr. Nakagawa conducted a detailed 
history and physical examinati on of Ms. Almond, who was then 36 years of age. Height 
and weight were not described in  his report, but I have been told were 5-7 in and 130 lb at 
the time of the motor vehicle crash at issu e. Notably, Dr. Nakagawa found a general loss 
of cervical spine motion of about 20% and te nderness over the cervical  facet joints, an 
area known to be injured in whiplash trauma and known to be one of the chief sources of 
chronic neck pain following whiplash. Range of motion has also been shown in several 
studies to be one of the best predictors  of outcome in whiplash trauma (14).  
 
Dr. Nakagawa concluded that a cervical strain injury had o ccurred. He mentioned that the 
“hard objective findings” did not seem to wa rrant the amount of care provided between 
December 26, 2001 and May 22, 2002, conjecturing instead that a course of 10-12 physical therapy visits, along with some fo llow-up appointments, would have sufficed. 
However, he later made this comment: “. . . it is my impression that Ms. Almond did 
sustain injury to her neck as a result of  the motor vehicle accident necessitating the 
treatment I felt to be reasonabl e,” (perhaps alluding here to  the course of therapy he 
recommended). 
 
One point worth considering in this report and its conclusions is the earlier acknowledgement by Dr. Nakagawa that th e chiropractic treatment received by Ms. 
Almond did appear to help her, and that she continued to be sympto matic at the time of 
his examination of her. Both of these facts would seem to weaken his argument that only 
10-12 PT visits and a few follow-ups woul d have been needed. PT has not been 
demonstrated to be more clinically effectiv e than chiropractic management of whiplash 
and it is unlikely that her course would be significantly different had she only been 
ALMOND, Natalie 
Page 7 of 10 
 
 
treated with a dozen or so visits to the ther apist. All of the modalities offered by PT fall 
within the domain of chiropractic practice, which has, of course, a broader scope of 
practice.  
 
Another important point worth making is the comment made concerning a lack of “hard 
objective findings.” The global loss of range  of motion observed by Dr. Nakagawa has 
always been regarded by physicians as hard  objective evidence and is perhaps the most 
important physical finding in this case based on recent research. Moreover, the AMA 
Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment , 5th edition, clearly endorse the 
importance of range of motion loss. By itself, loss of range of motion (or excess motion as viewed radiographically) can constitute significant degrees of  whole body impairment 
according to the AMA Guides. Additional impairment is a ssigned on the basis of long-
term pain. 
 
Finally, it does not appear that  Dr. Nakagawa looked at any imaging studies, yet, because 
Dr. Goldsmith (a radiologist) is involve d in the case, it would seem likely that 
radiographs of some type were  performed at some point. There is no mention of them in 
this report.  
 
Risk Assessment 
 
In many instances, accident reconstruction can provide important clues as to crash 
metrics, direction of travel, identification of seating position of occupants, and other important details. In the special case of low speed crashes, such as the one described in this case, this application of Newtonian mechanics is simply not sufficiently reliable for medicolegal purposes, as demonstrated rath er bluntly by Bartlett et al. (4) recently. 
Similarly, crash test research is useful for understanding crash effects, such as occupant 
kinematics, but is not capabl e of developing risk corridors  or safety boundaries. These 
studies lack statistical power for these purposes  due to their small number of crashes, the 
small number of occupants who cannot represent all real world victims, and the general non-representativeness to most real world cr ash scenarios. There are no known thresholds 
for injury in rear impact crashes at low speeds.  It is also noteworthy that several scientific 
studies have failed to show any strong correlation between crash speed/property damage and outcome (15-19). 
 
More meaningful is the clinical and epidem iological literature which does examine real 
world crash victims and, in some cases, r econstructions of large numbers of actual 
crashes, correlating the crash metrics and in jury risk and/or long-term outcomes. This 
broad literature allows us to develop a risk  assessment based on good science. In the case 
of Ms. Almond, several known risk factors appear to have been present. (Note that others 
may have been present as well, but were not brought out in the reco rds I reviewed.) And, 
while it is not possible to quantify their cumulative power or apportion their relative 
contributions to overall risk, it is clear that multiple risk factors will serve to significantly 
lower the threshold for injury and to incr ease the probability for long-term symptoms. 
ALMOND, Natalie 
Page 8 of 10 
 
 
These risk factors can be subcategorized into risk for acute injury and risk for long-term 
symptoms as follows: 
 
Risk Factors for Acute Injury  
 
1. Female sex. 
2. History of neck injury. 
3. Poor head restraint geometry. 
4. History of whiplash injury. 
5. Rear vs. other vector impacts. 
6. Use of seat belts/shoulder harness (i.e ., standard three-point restraints). 
7. Body mass index/head neck index (i.e., d ecreased risk with increasing mass and 
neck size). 
8. Front vs. rear seat position. 
9. Impact by vehicle of greater mass. 
10. Crash speed under 10 mph. 
11. For rear struck occupant, when the bullet vehicle has a motor that is longitudinally 
mounted. 
 
Risk Factors For Long-Term Symptoms 
 
1. Female sex. 
2. Rear vector impact vs. other vectors. 
3. Body mass index in females only. 
4. Use of seat belt shoulder harnes s. For neck (not back) pain. 
5. Past history of neck pain  or headache. 
6. Front seat position. 
 
(Note: for a thorough discussion of these risk  factors, see reference 13, pages 363-367.) 
 
Based on the foregoing risk assessment, one would have to conclude—accepting for the moment, Mr. Howard’ 6.08 mph delta V value—that  the risk for injury would have been 
moderately high in this case, as would the risk for long-term symptoms. And since Ms. 
Almond has been symptomatic for three and a half years, it is unlikely that she will recover further to any great degree, although occasional ongoing treatment may afford her relatively more comfort and functionalit y. In the meantime, degenerative cervical 
spine disease (e.g., spondylosis and facet arthro sis, along with disc degeneration) may be 
accelerated at injured spinal segments—usually  these are mid-to-low-cervical in location. 
I cannot comment on the likelihood of this happening in the pr esent case, having not seen 
any imaging studies in this case. 
 
Her symptoms picture and objective findings as  reported by Dr. Nakaga wa are consistent 
with cervical spine ligamentous injury in the facet region.

Review of Records 
 
The following records were reviewed by me. 
 
1. Two-page report dated December 6, 2004 by Charles R. Barrow, M.D. with 15-
page attachment of document review. 
2. Report from “MRA Forensic Sciences,”  signed by Mathew D. Markson, M.S., 
P.E. It is dated December 7, 2004. 
 
Report dated December 6, 2004 by Charles R. Barrow, M.D 
 
Dr. Barrow does not provide a list of the doc uments he reviewed, and is not able to 
determine whether any injuries occurred as  a result of the July 11, 2002 motor vehicle 
crash (MVC), suggesting that there are incide nts in the past that  “indicate significant 
forces applied to different parts of the body th at would be consistent with the complaints 
following the MVC of July 11, 2002.”  
 
The material he reviewed suggested a number of prior incidents, including a MVC injury in 1994 in which right shoulder pain resulte d, although it is not possi ble to determine if 
this was a glenohumeral “shoulder” or a trapezius “shoulder.” Other prior medical 
records do not suggest any biomechanically plau sible events or evidence of injury which 
would overlay Dr. Clearwater’s clinical picture as relates to the July 11, 2002 MVC in 
my opinion. There are hand injuries, an eye lacer ation, a scalp injury with a negative CT 
scan, and bilateral arthroscopic knee surgeries.  There are no other records describing this 
1994 shoulder injury, so presumably it was not a significant injury.  
 
From the July 11, 2002 MVC, there is an indi cation of a possible fracture of the right 
wrist, pain in the right wrist, and a loss of lordosis in the cervical spine. There is also a normal right wrist MRI, but the study date  was not provided. Subsequently, there are 
complaints of pain in both shoulders. Even tually, both shoulders were operated. It is 
noteworthy that much of the notes re viewed by Dr. Barrow were apparently 
undecipherable by him and I have reviewed only his attachments regarding these records. 
 
Dr. Barrow concurred with Dr. Waldon that a Bankart lesion of both shoulders would 
have required dislocations. However, I see nothing in the medical r ecord that indicates 
prior shoulder dislocatio ns. Moreover, while hyperabduction is the most common 
mechanism of shoulder dislocation, it is certain ly not the only mechanism and the labrum 
can also be damaged by the mechanism describe d in the auto crash reconstruction report 
which is discussed below. Thus, it seems to me that the preponderance of medical 
evidence available to me here is that the shoulders were both injured in the MVC of July 11, 2002 and subsequently required surgical management. Notwithstanding Dr. Barrow’s 
comment to the contrary, I see no reason to susp ect prior injury to ei ther shoulder as the 
proximate cause for the recent shoulder surger ies. In my opinion, these injuries occurred 
as a result of the July 11, 2002 MVC. There was also a neck injury and right wrist injury

which would also be biomechanically consis tent with the mechanism of trauma as 
described in these documents. 
 
It is further my understanding from correspond ence with Dr. Clearwater that he further 
injured his left shoulder in the MVC of  January 23, 2003, developed a right-sided 
inguinal hernia, and suffers now from ti nnitus which interfer es with sleep and 
conversation. Tinnitus, although the mechanism is poorly understood, is a common symptoms following these types of injuri es (Vibert and Hausler 2003). Although not a 
common component of rear impact type crashes, hernias are gene rally the result of 
weaknesses in the abdominal wall. The high de celeration loads against the seat belt and 
shoulder webbing would have resulted in overp ressure to both the thorax and abdomen 
which could conceivably have precipitated this  inguinal hernia. To prevent the risk of 
incarceration of bowel within the hernia, this should be surgically repaired on an elective 
basis. 
 
 
Report from MRA Forensic Sciences 
 
This is a review of a report from “MRA  Forensic Sciences,” signed by Mathew D. 
Markson, M.S., P.E. It is dated December 7, 2004 and is addressed to Alan C. Stephens concerning claim # 1001713164-1-4 (Clearwater v. Rocky Mountain Boiler, Inc.). This 
report does not discuss or even acknowledge  the subsequent motor vehicle crash of 
January 23, 2003. 
 
Mr. Markson has indicated that he has ACTAR certification and is a professional 
engineer. To the extent that he has offered opinions on the basis of biomechanics, injury 
probabilities based on his biomechanical analys es, and his reconstruc tion of the crash in 
question, I will offer the comments that follow.  I note that Mr. Markson is not a physician 
and did not personally interview or examine Dr. Clearwater. His review of the medical 
record in this case has exceeded his training, licensure, and qualifications, in my opinion, 
and thus consists chiefly of speculation a nd hearsay. Therefore, I will not comment 
further on those opinions other than to not e that, although he did make the standard 
legalese hedge on page two that his opinions were not “medical” but rather probabilistic, 
this is a subject of debate since, in the end, he has apparently told us when and where he 
believed the real shoulder injuries had occurred. I fail to see how such a determination deviates, logically, from an actual medical di agnosis. I do offer some contrary opinions 
concerning his statements about  the probability of injury. 
 
Collision Reconstruction 
 
With regard to the reconstruction of the cr ash, the following features are noteworthy. No 
examination of the vehicles was performed by Mr. Markson. Data sources consisted only 
of copies of color photographs, a repair estimate, and review of deposition transcripts and medical records. The number, quality, and vi ews of the photographs were not noted. The

likelihood that critical details can be missed when relying on photographs alone—
particularly if they are poor quality reproductions—is underscored by the comment on 
page three that the photographs failed to disclose damage that was reported by an investigator. A repair estimate  was reviewed, but this was ap parently not a final repair 
bill. Mr. Markson relied on de position testimony of both parties to this lawsuit. No 
calculations were provided anywhere in this  report, although it contains estimates for 
closing velocity, delta V, and peak accelerat ion. (The subject of that acceleration was not 
provided: usually it represents the mean longitudinal acceleration of th e target vehicle of 
Dr. Clearwater). The source of the closing ve locity was apparently  the testimony of the 
defendant that he was moving at about 7 mph at the time of contact. Logically, one would 
certainly question the reliab ility of a speed estimate made under the emergency 
conditions of a crash that likely was the resu lt of not paying sufficien t attention to avoid 
the collision.  
 
Mr. Markson also reli ed on bumper-to-barrier tests i nvolving two exemplar vehicles. 
These may have been Insurance Institute fo r Highway Safety tests which are performed 
on selected vehicles. However, the exact source of these tests wasn’t provided so I was unable to verify these data. It is likely that Mr. Markson’s intention was to demonstrate a degree of property damage that approximated the damage reported in this crash which occurred on 7-11-02 in order to provide some support for his assumptions about speed, which were given as being pr obably higher than the actual sp eeds in gracious deference 
to Dr. Clearwater. This comparison, however, is invalid since vehi cles crashing into 
vehicles behave quite differently from ve hicles crashing into barriers (Siegmund, Bailey 
et al. 1994; Siegmund, King et al. 1996). More over, repair costs can include costs to 
repair structural failure or co smetic damage (or both), and ex trapolation from repair costs 
to some quantification of actual crash severity  or crash energy is dubious for reasons that 
should be quite clear regardless of one’s b ackground in engineeri ng. Moreover, our crash 
tests, and those of other rese arch groups, have demonstrated vehicle property damage 
thresholds which ranged from closing velo cities from 4.8 mph to 10.1 mph and delta Vs 
ranging from 8.0 mph to 12.0 mph (Wolley, Stro ther et al. 1991; Szabo and Welcher 
1992; West, Gough et al. 1993; Bailey, Wong et al. 1995; Szabo and Welcher 1996; 
Siegmund, King et al. 1997; Croft and Freeman  2000; Cipriani, Bayan et al. 2002; Croft, 
Haneline et al. 2002). In many cases, multiple col lisions are possible in this speed change 
with zero resulting structural damage.  
 
The fact that there was some structural  damage in the subject case (found by the 
investigator who did inspect th e car), suggests, in fact, that  the figures for crash speed 
might have been significantly less charit able for Dr. Clearwater than Mr. Markson 
claimed. In any event, low speed rear impact collinear collisions are notoriously difficult to reconstruct with any reliability owing to  the assumptions and estimations that are 
necessary, and even with visual inspection of  fully instrumented crashed vehicles using 
momentum, energy, and restitution methods under laboratory contro ls the level of 
accuracy is unacceptable (Croft, Hanelin e et al. 2001). The only validation study 
published to date on photographi c reconstruction of crashes has demonstrated the method 
to be highly unreliable (Bartle tt, Wright et al. 2002). Having said that, even if we allow 
Mr. Markson his questionable estimated range of speed change for the target vehicle (3.9-
  
Adam Clearwater, D.C. 
Page 4 of 7 
6.0 mph) which is a range that I would certainly agree probab ly exists within the more 
realistic and broader range of un certainty, we would then have to conclude that an injury 
to Dr. Clearwater was possible, as I sha ll address under the biomechanical assessment 
below. In the meantime, in my opinion as both a crash test researcher, a collision reconstructionist (Northwest Un iversity, Center for Public Safety), and a Ph.D. candidate 
in biomechanical engineering, I would qualify the crash metrics estimated here as no 
more credible than an educated guess, a nd as lacking any formal mathematical or 
scientific basis. 
 
Biomechanical Analysis 
 
In brief, Mr. Markson was of the opinion that the forces to which Dr. Clearwater would have been exposed to (had his speculative  deductions concerning crash metrics been 
correct) would have been the equivalent of  a bumper car collision or amusement park 
ride. He also stated that it would have been the equivalent of his b acking into a barrier at 
2.6 to 4.3 mph, although the derivation of thes e figures was not provided. It is not a 
particularly enlightening comparison in any event since the average human tolerance for backing into rigid barriers, to the best of my knowledge, is neither known nor has it even 
been evaluated. On page five, Mr. Markson described Dr. Clearwater’s description of 
bracing for the impact and then moving rearward  and forward and, in the process, feeling 
his shoulders jerked in their sockets. Although I am not clear how Dr. Clearwater’s description did so, apparently, Mr. Markson felt it was in co ntravention to the laws of 
physics (which he put in capitals, apparently for emphasis). I can safely assure Mr. Markson that the laws of physics are quite safe  for the present and th at, in fact, this is 
precisely what happens to the human body during a rear impact crash. We have 
conducted more than 70 such tests at my institu te in the past half decade. Specifically, the 
jerking of the shoulders does occur when s ubjects grip the steering wheel firmly, as 
would be likely in the event as described here, in which the driver was aware of the impending impact. The rapidly accelerati ng car moves forward under the occupant, 
perfectly in accordance with Newton’s first la w of motion. In fact, we have high speed 
motion pictures of such events occurr ing in crashes of 5-7 mph delta V. 
 
It concerns me that Mr. Markson apparently is laboring under the im pression that bumper 
car collisions and amusement park rides ar e entirely benign and, apparently, quite 
comparable somehow to sitting in a 2858 lb Mazda 626 and being stru ck from the rear by 
a Chevrolet pick-up truck weighing approximate ly 4000 lb traveling at about 7 mph. (Mr. 
Markson did not provide the model of the pi ck-up truck, so this weight is only an 
approximation based on the average of severa l models.) Although not a single reference 
is cited in his report to support his conclusions  regarding injury risk, I will offer two in 
counterpoint. In reality, injuries can and do occur in bumper car contacts (Duffy, Stuberg 
et al. 2004) and amusement park rides, includ ing serious injuries requiring surgery and 
causing paralysis (Freeman, Nicodemus et al. 2001). In my opinion, these remarks about 
bumper cars and amusement rides are specious  and certainly provide  no assistance in 
understanding the nature of the in juries (or probability of inju ries) sustained in a specific 
  
Adam Clearwater, D.C. 
Page 5 of 7 
motor vehicle crash which is clearly different from either bumper cars or amusement park 
rides in several critical ways that any engineer should certain ly be able to appreciate.  
 
A more meaningful approach at risk assessm ent is to look at databases of real world 
crashes in which the true crash speed was known—rather than estimated. In truth, such 
work has been published and it turns out that  the mean crash delta V for rear impact 
crashes in cars not equipped with whiplash protection systems (and the 2000 Mazda 626 does not have one) is 5.1 mph—a value enco mpassed in the range allowed for by Mr. 
Markson (Krafft, Kullgren et al. 2004). It has also been demonstrated in an unselected 
whiplash population that shoulder injuries are actually fairly common (Magnusson 1994). 
Mr. Markson claims to have completed a biomechanical analysis of the shoulder, 
although there is nothing in the report desc ribing it or how it was done. As a board 
certified orthopaedist, I would agree that shou lder dislocations more often result from 
hyperabduction trauma which would not have occurred in this car crash, but using this as 
an argument against a cause and effect relations hip in this case is problematic. Shoulders 
are vulnerable to both distrac tion and compressive loading as would have occurred in this 
case based on our knowledge of occupant ki nematics and experience in human subject 
crash tests. After 23 years of experience, with  an emphasis in motor vehicle trauma, I can 
safely testify that shoulders are commonl y injured in this very type of crash. 
 
In conclusion, Dr. Clearwater’s shoulder injuries are fully consistent with the mechanism of injury which is described by him and wh ich was relied upon by Mr. Markson in his 
assessment. The crash speed range suggested by Mr. Markson is likel y to be low by 2-4 
mph and possibly more as noted, but, even if  we accept his speed range as a true an 
accurate range, it contains the mean value (not the lower boundary) where epidemiological evidence shows us injuries actually occur. Thus, Mr. Markson’s opinion 
that injury would have been unlikely are scie ntifically untenable even were his estimated 
speed range is not challenged. The spurious  notion that the crash would have been 
comparable to bumper car or amusement part rides is relatively meaningless since there is no way to compare the two events and since th ere is clear evidence that such events are 
not always benign and the injuries resu lting not always minor . Medical comments 
concerning when and where injuries occurred or, indeed, what events caused them is based only on a review of selected medical documents and is likely to exceed Mr. Markson’s training, licensure, and expertise and should be dismissed as speculation and 
hearsay.

and Doxycycline.   
07-26-1996 Records from James K. Mooney, M.D.  He’s having a procedure called transrectal 
prostatic ultrasonography. Also transrectal  prostatic ultrasonography guidance of 
transrectal biopsies of the prostate.  Evaluation of PSA and abrupt change in voiding 
symptomatology prompted this examination.   
10-03-1996 Records from James. K. Mooney, M.D ., from Norcal Urology Medical Group Inc.  
Mr. Arken has had a transabdominal ultrasonogr aphy of the pelvis/bladder.  There is 
a note regarding long-term back problems, voiding problems that reached a peak in 
1992-93 which have improved with conservativ e therapy considerab ly.  Also he had 
potency problems which seemed to resolve.  This has become progressively worse recently.  He has developed a lot of back  pain which he claims is related to 
locomotives that he is currently driving.  And he’s had problems with his bladder.  
He has residual urine after voiding which is  worse than a previous study in July.  
He’s going to have a renal ultrasound and a cystometrogram.  He’s encouraged to 
consult with a neurosurgeon, Dr. Nagel.   
10-11-1996 Letter from Richard C. Nagel, M.D. to  James Mooney, M.D.  One month ago he was 
driving a different type of train in the Sacramento switch yards.  A much more 
physical job and much more jarring inside the cab.  Because of this work he seems to 
have aggravated his back which has forced  bed rest for the last 10 days.   He 
acknowledges Dr. Mooney’s concern vis-a-vis neurological connection with problems of impotence.  Approximately two weeks ago his bowel function became 
less regular and he had increased nocturia w ith slight hesitancy.  His last spine MRI 
was five years ago.  He is tender in the lumbosacral region and flexion is limited to 
30 degrees from vertical.  Straight leg ra ising is 40 degrees on the right and left. 
Patrick maneuver is normal.  Pulses distally are diminished but present.  Deep tendon reflexes are all hypoactive.  Babinski reflexes are absent.  Sensory exam is good in 
 
 4 the legs and buttock region.  Rectal tone is  present.  He did not find cauda equina 
syndrome.  Sacral innervation appears good.  He does believe the lumbar spasm is 
precipitated by his job at the switch yard.  He is suggesting an MRI scan to compare with the scan five years ago.  He’s taki ng Darvocet 100N.  If the above measures do 
not help he may be forced to take a new job if available.   
10-16-1996 MRI of the lumbar spine from Alta Imaging Medical Group, Eric Gaensler, M.D.  
Evidence was noted of the 16 year ago sp ine surgery.  L2-3 shows a mild broad 
based disc bulge.  L3-4 shows a right paracentral disc protrusion with no compression of neural structures.  L4-5 s hows a loss of height and signal with mild 
broad based bulging posteriorly.  No comp ression of neural structures noted.  
Changes from posterior laminectomy are id entified.  The procedure appears to have 
been a right hemilaminectom y.  (Obscured handwritten comment at bottom of page.) 
 L5-S1 disc shows loss of height and si gnal with mild broad based bulging.  Mild 
sclerotic changes are noted in the adj acent end plates.  Neural foramina are 
moderately narrowed bilaterally due to a combination of osteophytic spurring from the vertebral bodies and mild facet join t hypertrophy.  No evidence of acute disc 
extrusion or significant mass effect on neural structures at this time.   
10-21-1996 Dr. Wideman’s handwritten notes.  Octobe r 1 awake with severe back pain.  10/10.  
No work since onset.  A lot of physical la bor with job -- in Stockton.  Some increase 
 in loose stools, bladder difficulty, s eeing Dr. Mooney.  Saw Dr. Nagel his back 
surgeon. MRI ordered and done last Wednesd ay.  Can’t read notes.  (?) Flexion 20 
degrees.  Meds Darvocet N100.  Exam show moderate SI joint tenderness.  Moderate 
paraspinal spasm in the lumbar area.  Back flexion is 20 degrees.  Deep tendon 
reflexes are 2+ and equal at quads and ankles.  Sensory (?  can’t read).  CT-(?).  Can’t read these notes.  Assessment is acute back pain (?) disc (her question mark).  
She is also putting him on Voltaren.  Also Robaxin.  Can’t be sure of these due to poor handwriting.   
10-22-1996 Letter for Dr.Wideman from Dr. Nagel.  He reviews the MRI scan.  He has informed 
Mr. Arken that the scan looks “good” and no surgery should be considered.  He also 
states “I am also concerned that there may be some exaggeration of symptoms as there is no true neurological pattern.”   
10-24-1996 Handwritten notes from Dr. Wideman via LVN Begley.  Patient called in severe pain 
yesterday, a little better today but unable to find a comfortable (?).  MRI negative.

pain and lumbar.  Poor Xerox quality record -- can’t read all of the record.  This is 
from Sierra Therapy and Hand Rehabilitation.  In this set of notes there is also a set dated 11-01-96.  There is a front and back mannequin with marks over the right inguinal region, medial and lateral right knee and right lateral anterior leg.  Also over 
the right middle buttocks region particularly  towards the hip and over the right calf 
 
 5 extending down into the foot.  The date of  initial evaluation is listed as 11-04-06.  
Main complaints are acute low back pain radiating into right groin and right lower 
extremity.  He is stiff in the morning, looser  at mid day, and stiff again at the end of 
the day.  Active range of motion in lumbar  spine shows flexion and extension 50%.  
Side bending and rotation are 75%.  SLR on the right is 35 degrees with increased 
numbness in the right foot.  Left is 60 degrees.  Complains that he sleeps poorly and 
wakes with right hip pain and spasm.  Lo wer extremity feels numb when standing or 
walking.  Symptoms are aggravated by sitting.  Goals of treatment are described: the 
usual, increase ROM, increase SLR, etc.  He’s receiving exercise and flexibility training, heat, ice, electrical stimulation, u ltrasound, etc.  This is a referral from Dr. 
Wideman apparently. 
11-13-1996 Sierra Therapy and Hand Rehabilitation notes.  The therapist on these records is 
Grete or Greta Skjellerud, P.T.  Symptoms are roughly the same as before but there 
is some improvement in AROM; flexion and extension are now 75%; side bending 
and rotation are 80%.  SLR on ri ght is 40 degrees with pain in right foot and left is 
70 degrees.  No pain on ROM of lumbar spin e.  Goals are again stated.  He’s having 
continuing with right groin pain at ni ght, numbness and pain in the right lower 
extremity and there are bowel and bladder function problems.   
11-14-1996 Typed notes from Dr. Wideman.  Patient has continued right hi p and leg pain.  Now 
has intermittent numbness in lower leg and calf.  With walking the hip seems to 
occasionally give way.  Has intermittently  had some difficulties with voiding and 
defecating but relates this more to the use of Robaxin and pain medication.  Stopped all his medications under his own directi on, not mine.  He has started physical 
therapy but is feeling intermittently bette r with walking and with sitting but with 
sleeping more in the supine position, he ju st cannot get comfortable.  She has not 
received neurologic evaluation from Dr. Nagel or copies of lumbar MRI.  There is no 
CVA tenderness or SI joint tenderness.  Lower extremities show DTRs are 2+ and 
brisk at the quadriceps and ankles.  Sensor y is decreased to pinprick on the lateral 
and posterior calf as well as over the dorsum of the foot. Vibratory sense remains intact.  Assessment is lumbosacral radi culopathy.  The recommendations are NCV 
and EMG per Drs. Baumbach and Geraght y.  He’s taking Indocin and continuing 
with physical therapy. 
11-14-1996 Handwritten notes from Dr. Wideman.  Back pain comes and goes.  Lots of pain 
since October 23.  Muscle relaxants helpful initially.  Pain goes into the right groin 
and right lower extremity.  He started PT on 11-04.  Has numbness in the right lower extremity calf and ankle.   
11-21-1996 Notes from Dr. Wideman’s office.  Dr. Friend called regarding EMG/NCV.  (?) 
Findings compatible with L4 neuropathy. 
12-03-1996 Handwritten notes from Dr. Wideman.  Called regarding back pain. Neurosurgery 
appointment.   
12-03-1996 Letter from Dr. Nagel to Dr.Wideman.  Th ere is a comment that Mr. Arken feels that 
his right hip and buttock sometimes give wa y.  He has had some rather intense pain 
in the right groin.  This is worse when lying down and relieved when he was walking. He feels some of the medications may have aggravated the condition.  The 
 
 6 pharmacist  suggested the possibility of allergy and he stopped the medication.  The 
EMG and NCV study by Dr. John H.  Friend were consistent with right L4 root and 
possibly L5 root involvement.  Periphera l nerve studies showed normal conduction.  
Examination shows his back is flat and flexi on is mildly restricted.  There is no point 
tenderness.  SLR is uncomfortable on the right in the hamstrings at 60 degrees.  
Right Patrick maneuver is positive.  Right inguinal pressure is positive.  These are 
new findings.  Deep tendon reflexes are presen t but with some decrease in the right 
knee reflex.  Sensory exam shows hypalgesia of the buttock on the right and L5 root distribution.  Due to the inguinal pain and Pa trick test he wanted to x-ray the right 
hip to rule out arthritis.  He still feels su rgery is not in order.  He asked whether 
stresses might be compounding his problem and he denied that.  He thinks that the 
railroad work is difficult with switching back and forth tending to pound on his spine.  He thinks that he is hesitant or fearful of returning to that job for fear of 
making his symptom complex worse.  He is sympathetic to that and feels that he 
should be away from work for several additional months.   
12-05-1996 Notes from Dr. Wideman.  Dr. Nagel (n eurosurgeon) back okay, hip better, NSAIDS. 
 Nagel is aware of EMG results.  Sleepi ng better.  Standing tolerated better than 
sitting or lying.   
12-05-1996 Report of the right hip x-ray from Kaye Drennan, M.D.  This is a normal 
examination of the hip. 
12-22-1996 Letter to Palma Wideman, M.D., from J ohn H. Friend, M.D.  (Note that Wideman’s 
address is crossed out and handwritten in as John Taylor, M.D.)  This is an EMG/NCV study.  There was 1-2+ fibrillati on and sharp wave potentials for the 
tibialis anterior and gluteus medius muscles and few insertional sharp wave potentials noted for the rectus femoris of  the quadriceps.  Interference pattern 
appeared to be full to maximal contracti on.  Possible decrease in numbers of motor 
units for gluteus medius and tibialis anteri or muscles.  The EMG for the right lower 
extremity is abnormal.  Very minimal ne uropathy is noted of the gluteus medius 
muscle of the hip which has predominat ely L5 or myotome innervation and the 
tibialis anterior of the anterior calf which has both L4 and L5.  Irritability changes of the rectus femoris were noted.  These are s uggestive of an L4 radiculopathy.  Due to 
the superior gluteal nerve distribution of th e hip there may also be a component of L5 
neuropathy.  Paraspinal muscles were not sampled because of the previous spinal 
fusion.  Late responses for L5 and S1 ne rves were WNL.  Motor nerve conduction 
studies for the RLE were WNL.    
12-30-1996 Handwritten notes from Dr. Wideman.  Unhappy camper (?).  No change in two and 
one-half months.  He wants to see orthopedi c person for a referral.  Still has low back 
pain and right hip pain.  Limited right hip flexion.  Has seen Dr. Hambly (?) in past 
and wishes to be seen by him again.  Also complains of (??), especially nocturnally.  
Assessment is L4/5 radiculopathy.  Mild (?) pruritus.  Referral to Dr. Hambly.   
12-30-1996 Typed letter to Mark Hambly, M.D.  Dr. Wideman is referring Mr. Arken for 
evaluation of low back and hip pain.  Ha s been through a number of tests and PT 
regimens in the past two and one-half months  without improvement.   Currently he is 
unable to return to work at Southern Paci fic Railroad due to his inability to flex his 
 
 7 right hip and persisting back pain.  He is  currently on no medications.  Allergies to 
Darvocet, Robaxen, and Indocin.   
12-30-1996 Records from Greta Skjellerud, P.T.  Pr ogress report.  Right hip pain has decreased 
but is still 6-7 on a scale of 0-10.  AROM not listed but there is a note that there is no 
pain on ROM of lumbar spine.  Conti nues to have numbness and tingling in the 
lateral aspect of the right lower extrem ity from the knee to the ankle which is 
constant.  SLR is 50 degrees with increas ed numbness of right foot on the right and 
left is 60 degrees.  There is a note that Mr . Arken has decreased function, particularly 
with his ability to do high step on the ri ght lower extremity, and in doing the toe 
stand.   
12-31-1996 Notes from Dr. Wideman’s office.  This is as regards to scheduling with Dr. Hambly. 
  
01-02-1997 Nurse’s notes from Dr. Wideman’s office.  Refers to discussions  with Union Central 
Disability.   
01-23-1997 This is a letter to Geoffrey Wiedema n, Jr., M.D., from Mark Hambly, M.D.  Mr. 
Arken is returning in a follow-up from a l ong hiatus.  He relates about four months 
ago being “bounced around hard” in the engi ne of his train.  He developed right-
sided leg pain.  He was seen by Dr. Nagel who felt no surgical lesion was present.  
MRI was ordered without significant HNP.  He  has no sciatic tension signs.  He has 
no weakness in the low extremities.  He has minimal sensory change in the right 
lower extremity.  Hambly did not feel that  this was a surgical lesion.  He does not 
believe the lumbar spine is responsible for his urinary symptoms.  He believes selective nerve root blocks might be of benefit.  Possibly other pain management 
techniques.  He’s referred him to Dr. Mike Levin for this.   
02-07-1997 Handwritten notes from Dr . Wideman.  Chronic pain (?) better.  Still burning pain 
Grade 6-7/10.  More mobile.  Will refer to Dr.Cohen.  Wants to get back to work.  
02-26-1997 Records from Robert S. Taylor, M.D.  (general practitioner).  ROS notes include 
insomnia and heartburn (GERD).  Also b ack pain and sciatica in 1979.  Handwritten 
notes include L/S strain and ETOH (no specifi c comment about that).  There is also a 
note about referral to John (?) something about neurologist.  Also chest x-ray.   
03-05-1997 Records from James C. Stoody, M.D. (neuro logist).  Date of birth is 01-30-37.  There 
is a letter also addressed to Robert Ta ylor, M.D.  Mr. Arken’s complaining of 
radicular low back pain.  He has a histor y of uncomplicated lumbar laminectomy at 
the right L4-5 level (1979).  He was off wo rk several months and returned to his 
usual and customary position.  In 1990 he was involved in an industrial accident injuring his right shoulder.  He had some degree of increased low back pain without 
radicular symptoms after that.  He believe s that his current problem stems directly 
from a continuation of that injury.  Seve ral months ago he had a short-term yard 
switching job in Stockton and noted a marked  exacerbation of his pain.  He normally 
works 20 days on and 10 days off, 12 hours a day.  On this particular occasion there 
was constant movement, coupling and uncoup ling, resulting in a major jarring of his 
back.  Over a 72 hour period of time he had gradual worsening and incapacitating pain.  On this occasion he also noted radia tion of pain into the right leg.  He rested 
for his 10 days off, however, his back probl em worsened.  He then had a severe 24 
 
 8 hour period of constant incapacitating right  inguinal pain.  He then noted numbness 
in the anterior medial aspect of the right  leg.  He was seen by Dr. Friend who did an 
EMG of the right leg.  He was also seen by Dr. Hambly and also by Dr. Nagel.  An 
MRI scan was done.  He then had physi cal therapy.  Has not noted any major 
improvement but does note a 40% improvement in his pain but still has severe 
grabbing approximately in the right hip that skips to the knee and subsequently to the ankle.  Concurrent with this he has noted  some urinary retention that possibly is 
prostatic in nature though his urologist apparently is not convinced.  NSAIDs have not been beneficial.  He has fairly good range of motion with hips and some 
tenderness on flexion on the right.  SL R is positive on the right.  He has good 
heel/toe walk.  Some hesitancy on right stool step without convincing proximal 
weakness.  Hip flexors are strong as are the adductors.  Distally strength is intact and 
there is no atrophy.  There is diminished pi nprick in the distal medial right leg.  
There is markedly diminished right knee jerk, left is 2+.  Both ankle jerks are 2+.  He 
reviews the MRI and finds definite lateral recess stenosis at the L3-4 level.  The nerve root appears to be impacted at the la teral recess.  The L4-5 surgical level is 
deformed though there is no clear cut nerv e root compression.  His impression is 
“right L3-4 radiculopathy.”  He thinks th at Mr. Arken’s symptoms are quite classic 
for this condition.  A selective nerve root block would be both therapeutic and diagnostic.  He would not exclude the possibility for a simple lateral laminectomy at that level should this not prove effective.   
03-12-1997 This is a report from R. Knutzon, M.D. to Dr. Stoody.  This is the report of the multi-
level nerve block.  This was a right L3 selective nerve root block.  There was immediate recovery from the burning sensation in the right leg.   
03-24-1997 Letter to Robert Taylor, M.D. from James Stoody, M.D.  A selective nerve root 
block by Dr. Knutzon at L3 resulted in total relief of his pain for approximately three 
days.  He continues to have significant radicular proximal leg pain that remains 
intolerable for him.  I have asked him to return for an EMG and a follow-up with Dr. 
Knutzon for a second and possibly third selective nerve root block.  If these are not effective surgical intervention will be necessary.   
03-26-1997 Letter to Dr. James Stoody from Dr. Ra ndy Knutzon.  Mr. Arke n has had significant 
improvement after the L3 nerve block.  He wants to begin the right nerve root block 
to see if this level is more symptomatic.  (He meaning Arken.)   
03-28-1997 This is a report from James Stoody, M.D.   Abnormal EMG due to evidence of acute 
degeneration in the L5 myotome distributi on.  Findings consistent with acute and 
possible subacute L5 radiculopathy.   
03-28-1997 Report from R. Knutzon, M.D. regarding the selective right L5 nerve root block.   
04-01-1997 Records from James Stoody, M.D.  Mr. Arken returned today.  He had a selective L5 
root block done by Dr. Knutzon five days ago.  He did have immediate improvement 
in right leg pain.  Over the past five days the anesthesia has worn off but his leg pain has not returned to the severity it was befo re the procedure.  He believes that he 
should have another nerve root block at the L5 level next week.  There is objective evidence for a chronic L5 radiculopathy.   
04-09-1997 Report from Philip A. Baum, M.D., addressed to Dr. Stoody.  This is the report of a 
 
 9 selective right L4-5 nerve root block.   
04-11-1997 Letter to Robert Taylor, M.D. fr om James Stoody, M.D.  Mr. Arken has had 
unsuccessful nerve root blocks and remains significantly impaired related to pain.  
He believes a surgical opinion is necessary at this time.  He is temporarily totally 
disabled from his duties as a locomotive engineer due to incapacitating pain with 
positional maintenance, either sitting or standing, which would preclude him from 
operating his train with any degree of safety or facility.   
05-13-1997 WC/PI intake history form from office of Dr. DeLong.  Worker’s Comp claim starts 
September 1996 while performing flat, heavy switching of (?) cars at Port of Stockton in September 1996.  The accident is described as “heavy slack action over a period of two weeks while switching at Fort job-705.”  He’s been off work since 09-29-96.  Complaints noted include lower back, right hip pain radiating into right lower 
extremity outside calf, numbness on lower leg into foot with tingling into toes.  Right kneecap area also experiences pain.  Lo w back pain is stabbing and burning 
sometimes into mid back.  In additi on to the obvious, sleeping problems and 
depression and constipation are listed on the menu of complaints on this form.  Sneezing and coughing, driving, getting up from sitting position, bending, stooping, 
twisting and leaning forward over a sink are described as aggravating factors.  He 
can sit for 30 minutes or longer and he avoi ds all lifting.  There is a handwritten note 
regarding low back pain before 09/96 but minimal.  Also (?) up after 1990 accident 
for one to three years approximately.  He sleeps four to five hours but has difficulty 
turning in bed.  There is also a question as to whether he had these kinds of symptoms before and he answered yes for the 1978 and 1990 injuries but there is 
also a comment that he resolved after su rgery in 1978 and one to two years after the 
1990 injury.  Regular exercise is walking 3+ miles per day and one to two mixed drinks per day.  Noted to be on a low fa t diet.  Mannequin drawings are fairly 
consistent with that of the physical therapist and denote bilateral low back pain, right 
gluteal area pain and pain in the right proxi mal anterior thigh, right knee, right lateral 
proximal leg with numbness and tingling on the anterior leg and dorsum of the foot and plantar region of the right foot as we ll.  Under expected goals, he has checked 
get me back to work in my previous j ob.  He’s also agreed to accept exercises, 
weight loss, chiropractic care, physical therapy, injection treatment s, and surgery if it 
would help him.   
05-21-1997 A five page report from Dr. DeLong to Dr. Taylor.  Ther e is a comment in the history 
section regarding the 1990 work comp in cident in which the back pain was 
aggravated for up to three years and then  settled back down to the pre 1990 level.  
Three nerve blocks were tried without any significant help.  Over the last few weeks 
he has also noted the onset of cervical pai n, predominately left-sided with radiation 
of pain into his left upper extremity to his left hand.  He has pain and numbness involving the thumb, index and middle finger of  his left hand.  He is not currently 
taking any medications.  Lumbar ROM is lim ited to 10 degrees in extension, forward 
flexion with finger tips to mid tibia.  Cervical ROM is 45 degrees extension, 50 degrees flexion, 60 of rotation to each side (no lateral flexion notations).  There is 
paraspinal tenderness in the cervical spine and lumbosacral region.  Suggestion of 
 
 10 weakness in right hip flexors.  Upper extremity strength is normal.  He has 
hypalgesia over the lateral aspect of the right  thigh and over the radial aspect of the 
dorsum of his hands on each side.  Reflexes  are 1-2+ at the triceps, biceps and 
brachioradialis, absent at the right knee, 2+ at the left knee, and 2+ at the ankles.  
SLR is to 40 degrees at each side at wh ich point hamstring tension limits further 
excursion.  He agrees with the radiologist that there is right paracentral disc protrusion at L3-4 with right foraminal ste nosis at that level.  There is a small 
protrusion at L5-S1.  His impressions are that  there is a possible HNP right L3-4 with 
spinal stenosis and right L3 and/or L4 radiculopathy.  He also believes that there is a possible disc derangement in the cervical sp ine and that there is cervical spondylosis 
and left radiculopathy.  He’s recommendi ng Dr. Hsu to procede with an L3-4 
discogram followed by CT scanning.  He thinks Mr. Arken probably will need a right L3-4 decompressive laminectomy and discectomy.   
05-21-1997 Union Pacific Railroad medical progr ess report signed by Dr. DeLong.  Date of 
injury is listed as 09-26-96.  Prognosis is  undetermined.  Diagnoses is “post-op 
microdiscectomy/lumbar laminectomy.”  Prognosis is undetermined.  Not able to return to work at this time.  Anticipated return to work is 02-01-98. 
05-23-1997 This is a report on a cervical spine 5-vi ew x-ray study from J.C. Chen, M.D.  There 
is mild disc space narrowing at C5-6 and moderate anterior boney spurring at C5-6 
and C6-7.  Mild anterior boney spurring is also noted at C3 and C4 but the cervical spine is in normal alignment and appos ition with no evidence of fracture or 
subluxation.  The neural foramina are without significant impingement.  His 
impression is moderate spondylosis at C5-6 and C6-7 and mild spondylosis at C3 and 
C4.   
05-29-1997 MRI of the cervical spine reported by J. C. Chen, M.D.  The impression “moderate 
left posterior lateral disc herniation at C5-6 with significant mass effect on adjacent 
cervical cord and left C5-6 neural forame n.  Posterior bulge annulus at C3-4, C4-5, 
and C6-7.”   
06-04-1997 Sierra Therapy and Hand Rehabilitati on notes.  Diagnosis is HNP right L3-4, 
possible HNP of C-spine with LUE radicul opathy.  He’s complaining of neck pain 
with pain radiating to the right thumb and first finger and of burning pain into the right lateral calf and anterior aspect of th e right hip on hip flexion past 90 degrees.  
He’s having difficulty sleeping.  Gets up several times during the night.  ROM of the 
neck is listed as 1 cm from the chest flexion (extension not noted), rotation to the right is 60 degrees, left is 60 degrees.  Si de bending is 20 degrees to both sides.  
AROM in the L-spine 75% with discomfort  upon straightening up from flexion; 50% 
in extension.  SLR is 40 degrees on the ri ght with increased numbness in the right 
foot and the left is 60 degrees.  Under fre quency/duration we have  two to three times 
per week for 12 weeks.  This referral now comes from Dr. DeLong.   
06-11-1997 Handwritten notes, apparently from Dr . DeLong.  These notes describe cervical 
levels and provide a number of dates.  It ’s not clear what the meaning is.  These 
notes are difficult to read.   
07-07-1997 This is a result of lumbar discogram  reported by John P. Gartland, M.D., from St. 
Mary’s Hospital and Medical Center.  L2-3 shows normal disc, L3-4 shows 
 
 11 moderate, partially concordant low back pain.  L4-5 disc space is moderately 
narrowed and the contrast is abnormally disbursed throughout the disc space.  Severe 
partially concordant low back pain.  Poor e nd point, more than 4 cc’ s.  L5-S1 there is 
some disc space narrowing.  Contrast is abnormally disbursed throughout the disc 
space.  Severe fully concordant  low back  pain, right buttock and right leg pain.  
More than 4 cc’s, poor end point.  Th e CT of the lumbar disc spaces post 
discography is also reported here.  L2-3 disc is normal.  There is slight facet hypertrophy but the boney diameters are norma l.  L3-4 there is broad fissure 
posterolaterally on the right side with some  leakage of contrast beyond the expected 
area of the ligament.  This probably repres ents a small focal right paracentral disc 
protrusion, as well as a fissure in the a nnulus.  There is moderate facet hypertrophy 
on both sides, but the boney diameters are in tact.  L4-5 shows remaining contrast 
throughout the disc space.  Probably has been  a previous partial laminectomy on the 
right side.   Broad based disc bulging but  no protrusion.  Moderate bilateral facet 
hypertrophy and some narrowing of the left  neural foramen.  The entire neural 
foramina are not included in these scans and cannot be completely evaluated.  The 
central spinal canal is not compromised.  Th e right neural foramen is intact.  L5-S1 
contrast is abnormal, disbursed thr oughout the disc space.  Bilateral facet 
degeneration somewhat greater on the right.  I do not see a disc protrusion, there is 
spondylitic ridge across the broad base, however, which does extend into the right neural foramen.  There is some narrowing of  the right neural foramen.  The central 
canal left neural foramen appear to be intact.   
07-07-1997 Report of lumbar discogram by Ken Hs u, M.D.  This is a recap of the other 
discogram report.   
07-26-1997 Sierra Therapy and Hand Rehabilitation notes.  This is a post operative 
microdiscectomy, right L5-S1.  Numbness and tingling in the right lower extremity from the knee to ankle.  Limited AROM in the L-spine.  This is especially with 
extension which is 25%.  Symptoms are still aggravated with prolonged sitting. Laying down is comfortable but patient does awaken from sleep with turning.   
08-05-1997 Report of a 2-view chest series by Robert  E. Clark, M.D.  There is not active chest 
disease noted.  This study was ordered by Dr. DeLong.   
08-05-1997 Report from Emil Tangho, M.D.  This is a urological procedure and the results were 
that there was evidence of normal bladder compliance and normal bladder capacity but with a diminished sensation.  There was a coordinated voiding with sphincteric 
relaxation associated with detrusor contrac tion.  There was an implication of bladder 
outlet obstruction.  Endoscopic examination did reveal the presence of bilobular 
enlargement, small but probably obstructive starting evidence of bladder neck atrophy (sic).   
08-07-1997 This is a lumbar discogram report fr om Ken Hsu, M.D.  (This may be a duplicate 
record.)  Injection at L2 did not initiate any kind of pain.  Inje ction at L3 created 
moderate pain which was partially concorda nt.  At L4 there was severe pain which 
was partially concordant.  The disc accepted more than 4 cc’s of dye with a poor end 
point.  Injection at L5 created severe pain  which was fully concordant and the disc 
accepted more than 4 cc’s of dye with a poor end point.  Overall, he rated the 
 
 12 patient’s pain tolerance as low and his psychological response as normal.  
08-07-1997 This is a pre-operative H&P from Arthur  Schuller, M.D.  The history includes the 
1979 surgery with the L4-5 discectomy which was helpful.  He then had self-limited 
episodes of back pain over time.  However, in 1990 he was involved in an railroading accident in which he was knocked unconscious injurying his right shoulder and developed a flare-up of his low back pain.  This gradually settled to the pre 1990 level after approximately three years.  He  also, during that time, noticed the onset 
and worsening of urological symptoms.  He also began to experience increased sexual dysfunction, namely, erectile failure.  There were no bowel symptoms related 
to these work-related injuries.   In 1996, in  September, he had another work-related 
injury and developed severe back pain radiating into the anterolateral aspect  to the right thigh and had to stop working in Sept ember.  He has had a surgery on the right 
shoulder, injury described above, which has been successful.  He does not smoke and drinks one to two mixed drinks per day.  He is described as having some abdominal 
obesity.  Range of motion of the neck is almost full in all planes except for extension and this is limited by stiffness and pain.  (No degrees are provided.)  Muscle strength in upper extremities was 5/5 bilaterally in the C5-T1 distribution.  DTRs were 1-2+ bilaterally at the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis, including dynamic Hoffman’s 
(?).  (There is a handwritten notation that  places a negative sign with a circle around 
it in front of dynamic, indicating probably that there was a negative dynamic Hoffman’s.)   ROM in the lumbar spine was restricted in all planes, especially flexion and extension.  Most painful in right lateral bending.  SLR in the seated 
position was to 90 degrees bilaterally.  St rength in the L4-S1 distribution was 5/5 
bilaterally with normal heel and toe walking.  DTRs were 2+ at the knees and ankles 
except for the right knee in which the DTR c ould not be well elicited.  The toes were 
down going and there was no clonus.  He is medically cleared for surgery.   
08-12-1997 Letter to Robert Taylor, M.D., from Dr. DeLong.  Mr. Arken was reevaluated and 
continues to have right lower extremity pa in radiating into the anterolateral right 
thigh to the lower leg and to the dorsum and lateral aspect of the right foot.  He discusses the results of the discogram sugge sting that the L5-S1 level is the primary 
pain generator.  He is recommending an  L5-S1 microsurgical discectomy.  This 
should be confined to the right side in order to minimize post-operative instability and to minimize epidural scarring on the left  side.  He is having a small amount of 
left sided pain but it is probable that deco mpressing the disc from the right side will 
relieve the left sided symptoms since they are minimal.  Mr. Arken is in agreement 
with this planned procedure.  He also continues to have neck and left upper extremity pain and this may have to be looked at la ter with selective nerve root blocks and 
possibly cervical discectomy and fusion.  Also he comments on the urodynamic 
studies that were ordered to rule out the possibility of neurogenic bladder which they 
did.  It is thought that he may need urological  surgery at some point.   
08-13-1997 Operative report from St. Mary’s Medical Center, the surgeon is Dr. DeLong, the 
assistant surgeon is Mark Drzala, M.D.  Pre-operative diagnosis is “status post-operative herniated intervertebral disc  with excision, right L4-5; herniated 
intervertebral disc with right radiculopa thy, L5-S1.”  Same post-operative diagnoses. 
 
 13 Surgery was microsurgical decompression laminectomy and discectomy, right L5-
S1, with right inferior partial laminectom y, L5, right superior partial laminectomy, 
S1; right medial facetectomy, L5-S1; right L5 foraminotomy; excision of L4-5 disc 
on the right; free fat graft to epidural space.  There is also a co-surgeon, which is Dr. 
Hsu, and a second assistant named Katherine Bozeman, M.D.   
08-14-1997 Surgical pathology report from St. Mary’s Medical Center.  Tissue received was disc 
L5-S1.  Diagnoses was “intervertebral disc material.”   
08-15-1997 Physical therapy prescription from Dr. DeLong to Sierra Therapy.  This is a post-
operative prescription and includes recommendations for McKenzie exercises, 
ultrasound, EGS, diathermy, ot her modalities as indicated.  Also mechanics training, 
etc.   
08-16-1997 Chart summary from St. Mary’s Medical Center by Arthur B. Schuller, M.D.  Mr.  
Arken is discharged on a regular diet to  follow-up with Dr. DeLong and  Dr. Hsu.  
He is taking Vicodin and Aleve.   
09-16-1997 Sierra Therapy and Hand Rehabilitation notes.  Mr. Arken is complaining of dull 
aching pain in the right anterior hip progressi ng to the lateral aspect of the right thigh 
to the lateral right shin to ankle.   Also  muscle spasm and tremor in the right lower 
extremity when lying down.  He has numbness and tingling at the plantar aspect of 
the right foot which occurs daily when laying down.  ROM is improving somewhat.  
SLR is improving somewhat.  Coughing and sneezing cause back pain.  Sitting and standing cause right hip pain.  Driving aggravates pain.   Walking is comfortable for 
10 minutes.  He can heel/toe walk.  The right leg is weak in weight bearing.  (Note that none of these records contain inform ation about DTRs, mu scle strength, atrophy, 
muscle tone, etc.)   
09-23-1997 Radiology request from Dr. DeLong for post-op L5-S1 (?) discectomy with recurrent 
right leg pain.  He’s ordering a lumbar MRI with gadolinium enhancement.   
09-23-1997 This is an MRI of the lumbar spine w ith intravenous gadolinium.  This is a report 
from John P. Gartland, M.D.  Some reaction marrow changes seen at L4-5.  No destructive lesions present.  L2-3 shows some facet degeneration but otherwise is 
normal.  L3-4 shows a mild broad based di sc protrusion. Some enhancement seen in 
the right paracentral region in the protrudi ng annulus which may represent a fissure.  
There is slight to moderate facet hypert rophy but boney diameters are normal.  L4-5 
shows probable previous laminectomy.  Left  paracentral disc protrusion which is 
slight in extent but does efface the thecal sac somewhat.  This is about the same as was seen on the post discogram CT of 07- 07-97.   There is mild enhancement of 
some posterior scar tissue.  L5-S1 there ha s been a right partial laminectomy.  There 
is extensive granulation/scar tissue seen at the operative site on the right side and extending into the right neural foramen.  Ho wever, there remains some tissue of disc 
signal intensity which does not enhance in the midline.  The right nerve root is posterior to the left and is surrounded by e nhancing tissue.  The apparent remaining 
disc tissue does not seem to extend into the neural foramen.  There has been apparent 
partial facetectomy anteromedially on the right at this level.  There is normal enhancement in the disc space as well consiste nt with recent surgery (sic).  There is 
no evidence to suggest discitis or osteomyelitis.  So, at L5-S1, he believes there may 
 
 14 be some remaining disc material in the midline which is protruding slightly.  Also 
there is left paracentral protruding disc at L5-S1 which is unchanged.   
09-23-1997 This is a medical assessment of resi dual functional capacity on a form titled “United 
States of America Railroad Retirement Board.”   As to exertional restrictions, it is 
said that he can stand and/or walk with  normal breaks for less than two hours total 
due to severe right lower extremity pain a nd impaired SLR.  He can sit with normal 
breaks for less than six hours total (note th at there is only two possible check boxes, 
one is “less than six” and one is “more than  six”).  This is due to back pain and 
recent surgery.  With regard to lifting, he can occasionally lift less than 10 pounds 
but cannot lift more than 10 pounds at all.  He is never to bend, stoop, crouch, squat, 
climb, reach above shoulder level.  He is allowed to do simple grasping, fine 
manipulation, pushing or pulling.  He cannot use both feet for repetitive foot controls 
but can see, hear and speak.  Environment re strictions include total restriction from 
unprotected height, moderate restriction from driving/operating machinery, being 
around moving machinery, or uneven terrain/s tairs.  He has no restrictions to 
exposure to dust, fumes, noise, vibration, or temperature or humidity.  There are no mental restrictions.  This is signed by Dr. DeLong. 
09-29-1997 This is a selective lumbar nerve root block report from Ken Hsu, M.D.  The patient 
has had symptoms for several weeks.  He  has had one prior back surgery and one 
performed within the last three months.  The pain is located in his low back and legs.  The procedure is described.  Injection wa s at the right L5 level exactly reproducing 
his usually symptoms.  He was given injection of Zylocaine mixed with 
DepoMedrol.  He gets 80% overall subjective improvement post-block.   
10-13-1997 This is a special procedure prescripti on from Dr. DeLong to Dr. Hsu for right leg 
pain after L5-S1 discectomy and he is asking for lumber epidural injections: a series 
of two to three, L3-4 through L5-S1.   
10-13-1997 Special procedure prescription from Dr. DeLong to Dr. Judy Silverman requesting 
EMG and NCV of low back and right lower extremity.   
10-27-1997 This is a lumbar epidural block report from Dr. Hsu.  At the present time Mr. Arken 
is having pain in his low back and legs .  The patient again had Zylocaine and 
DepoMedrol.  Injection into the interspace at L3 level unclearly reproduced his usual symptoms.  He had a 50% overall subjective improvement post-block and during active range of motion testing.  The patie nt’s pain tolerance and psychological 
response was graded as normal.   
10-27-1997 This is a report by Judy L. Silverman, M.D., to Dr. DeLong.  On examination she 
finds sensation decreased in the left L4 dist ribution to light touch, otherwise intact in 
L5 and S1.  Strength is intact, graded 5/5 in the lower extremities bilaterally.  Deep 
tendon reflexes are symmetric at the knees and ankles, Grade 2.  She performs EMG. 
 The study is normal with exception of ri ght mid and lower lumbar paraspinal 
muscles which have insertional activity w ith 3+ fibrillation and positive sharp waves. 
 However, there are no fasciculations.  This study shows evidence of ongoing denervation in the right lumbar paraspinal muscles, not in the left.  There are no other findings of abnormality in the right lower extremity, this could represent focal muscle trauma due to surgery, root impi ngement of the posterior rami or an 
 
 15 undetermined level, or persistent changes from his initial radiculopathy.  Previous 
EMGs done in April and later this summe r of 1997 prior to his surgery reported 
findings consistent with right acute L5 ra diculopathy; however, in both studies the 
paraspinal muscles were not sampled given a previous disc surgery approximately a 
decade ago.   
10-31-1997 Sierra Therapy and Hand Rehabilitation note.   This is a discharge summary.  Patient 
was last treated on 10-03-97.  At that time he reported decreased pain for about two 
days following injection. He wants to hold off on resuming his exercise program and therapy until he is finished with the injec tions.  He’s been given a home program of 
stabilization exercises.   
11-10-1997 This is another physical therapy prescrip tion for a Michael Moore, R.P.T.  “only.”  
This is from Dr. DeLong.  He’s asking again for McKenzie exercises, ultrasound, 
etc., and various stabilization and conditioning exercises.   
11-24-1997 Handwritten note in  package of notes from Dr. DeLong (however, this is not signed). 
 Appears to read discussion with Dr. Hsu.  No benefit from first block, second block 
done today.  If no better with this one , will need to consider three level 
decompression and discectomy.   
11-26-1997 Sierra Therapy and Hands Rehabilitation.  This form has essentially nothing written 
on it outside of a diagnosis and Dr. DeLong’s name.   
12-05-1997 Sierra Therapy and Hand Rehabilitation not es.  Mr. Arken continues to complain of 
discomfort in the right lower extremity.  He reports no back pain.  Right groin and 
anterior thigh pain has decreased.  AROM in L-spine continue to be limited.  SLR on 
the right increases discomfort in right lowe r extremity.  It is diminished compared 
with the left.   
12-15-1997 Handwritten note from Dr. DeLong describing some benefit to the last epidural 
injection.  SLR on the left is positive at 90 degrees and on the right at 40 degrees 
produces burning posterior thigh pain.  He’s recommending proceeding with third 
epidural injection.  Otherwise, may need further decompressive surgery.   
12-15-1997 Typed chart notes from Ken Hsu, M.D.  The recent epidural block provided relief of 
back pain for Mr. Arken but he still has right  sided lower extremity pain.  He still has 
a straight leg raising on the right side w ith burning sensation.  He is neurologically 
intact.  A repeat epidural block is consid ered.  The patient claims he can walk any 
distance without pain and can sit one-half hour and he can stand about one-half hour. 
 He can sleep only six hours with medication.  Oswestry test score was 40/100.   
12-29-1997 This is a lumbar epidural block report fr om Dr.  Hsu.  This was an injection into the 
L4 interspace “unclearly reproduced his usual symptoms.”  Patient had some 
acknowledged relief with 50% overall subj ective improvement post-block during 
active range of motion testing.   
01-14-1998 Physical therapy discharge report from Sierra Therapy and Hand Rehabilitation.  
Patient continues to have discomfort in the right thigh and lower extremity.  Right anterior shin, right big toe and bottom or ri ght foot are numb and tingling and this is 
constant.  He’s got about 75% range of mo tion in the L-spine w ith the exception of 
rotation which is 50%.  SLR is still diminished in the right with discomfort in the right foot.  He will continue with stabilization exercise program and is on 
 
 16 independent gym program until next surgery.   
02-17-1998 Letter to Robert Taylor, M.D., from Dr . DeLong.  He notes that Mr. Arken felt that 
the surgery performed on the right side at  L5-S1 probably helped with the severe 
deep gluteal pain that he was having but recurring right groin and thigh pain has not 
resolved.  He’s had three lumbar epidural injections.  The middle one helped him to a 
mild degree.  The other two did not.  He’s  still having radiating pain at the right 
lumbosacral region into the right gluteal  region and groin down the posterolateral 
aspect of the right thigh.  It  then goes anteromedially into the right lower leg to the 
sole of the right foot.  SLR is to 60 degr ees on the right and 80 degrees on the left.  
There is no weakness in the lower extremitie s.  There is hypalgesia over the dorsum 
of the right foot and over the right great toe.  Because of persistent pain he and Dr. 
Hsu are proposing that they re-operate  performing a decompressing laminectomy 
with discectomy on the right side at all three of the pathological levels ( L3 to S1).  
They have cautioned him that there is no guarantee for the procedure and he may 
ultimately require a lumbosacral fusion la ter on.  His cervical and upper extremity 
symptoms have improved to some degree and he  feels he is able to tolerate those.  
Therefore, they will not plan to do anything at this point.  Surgery may be necessary 
in the future.   
02-17-1998 Letter to Dr. DeLong from Dr. Hsu.  This discusses the continuing significant right 
lower extremity symptoms and the possi bility of decompression and discectomy.  
Also the possibility of lumbar spine fusion is broached.   
03-11-1998 This is a prescription form for NovaCare.  Referring physician is Dr. DeLong.  Boxes 
checked on the form are for exercise and posture, positioning, body mechanics.   
03-17-1998 This is a surgical report from St. Ma ry’s Medical Center.  Co-surgeon is Ken Hsu, 
M.D., and Bradford DeLong, M.D., and Mark Dr zala, M.D.  (Drzala is (?) assistant.) 
 Pre-operative diagnosis is “possible recurrent disc herniations, L4-5 (? obscured) or 
L5-S1, possible herniated disc L3-4, lateral recess stenosis, multiple levels; status post-operative right discectomies, L4-5 a nd L5-S1.”  Post-operative diagnosis is 
“recurrent disc herniation, L4-5, with se vere right lateral recessed stenosis, 
intervertebral disc protrusion, L3-4; severe  foraminal stenosis, L5-S1; status post-
operative right discectomies,  L4-5 and L5-S 1.”  In addition they found quite a bit of 
scarring and released that.   
03-17-1998 This is the surgical pathology report.  Tissue received lumbar disc.  Microscopic 
diagnosis “intervertebral disc material, L3-4 and L5-S1.”   
03-17-1998 This is a intra-operative lateral lumbar  spine single view reported by Robert Hart, 
M.D.  Multiple surgical devices are noted.   
03-21-1998 Discharge summary from St . Mary’s Medical Center.  This is a report from Arthur B. 
Schuller, M.D.  Diagnosis is “recurrent herniated disc, L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1; foraminal stenosis on the right at L3-4, L4 -5, and L5-S1.  He had a right laminotomy 
L3-4, L4-5, L5-S1 and foraminotomies and discectomies.  Motor strength in the upper extremities was 5/5 bilaterally from C5-T1 distribution.  DTRs were 1-2+ 
bilaterally at the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis, including a negative dynamic 
Hoffman’s.  ROM in the lumbar spine was restricted in all planes, especially flexion and extension and most painful on right  lateral bending.  SLR was 90 degrees 
 
 17 bilaterally.  (No comment re C-spine ROM.)  Muscle strength in the lower 
extremities was 5/5 bilaterally in L4-S1 distribution with normal heel and toe 
walking and squatting.  DTRs were 2+ at th e left knee and ankle and at the right knee 
DTR could not be elicited.  There was no clonus.  He is to use a corset when up.   
04-03-1998 Handwritten notes from (?) Dr. DeLong.  Patient called, having right sciatica.  
Something or other only at night, can’t sleep.  Can’t read all of notes.  
04-06-1998 Records from NovaCare (formerly Sierra Therapy and Hand Rehabilitation).  Patient 
is complaining of pain extending from the right buttock to the right lateral thigh, 
progressing down to the right knee and shin.  Numbness and tingling in right lateral 
thigh to right knee and anterior shin, down to the dorsum of the foot.  Constant and 
worse at night.  Side bending in the L-spine is 0 degrees bilaterally.  Flexion is not 
possible and rotation is 50% to both sides.  Le ft side aggravates ri ght foot pain.  SLR 
is now diminished to 40 degrees on right with  discomfort in right foot and 50 degrees 
on left. Active right hip flexion is 70 degr ees.  Left is 90 degrees.  Laying in bed 
aggravates right lower extremity numbness a nd pain.  Stiffness in the A.M. which 
improves as the day progresses and with walk ing.  Sitting is limited to eating meals.  
Laying down causes numbness of foot and problems with right thigh.  (Note that frequency/duration comment regards a pl an for treatment -- not duration of 
symptoms that the patient has.)   
04-17-1998 Physical therapy progress report from  NovaCare. These notes continue to be 
generated by Greta Skjellerud, P.T.  Mr. Arken continues to have complaints of pain 
extending from the right lateral thigh to the ri ght knee and shin.  Back  is very stiff.  
Still having numbness and tingling in the right lower extremity.  This is constant but 
the intensity has diminished.  Side bending in the L-spine is still 0 degrees.  Rotation is 50%.  SLR is 50 degrees on the right and 65 degrees on the left with discomfort in 
the right lower extremity on the right.  Activ e left hip flexion in 120 degrees; right is 
110 degrees.   He is able to put on shoes and socks and is sleeping better but still wakes up with stiffness.  His main problems seems to be numbness extending from the right shin to the foot with stiffness in the back.   
04-21-1998 Handwritten notes from Dr. DeLong.  Bette r.  Less pain in right lower extremity.  
Numbness persists.  SLR 70 degree right, 80 degrees left.  Decreased pain right 
lower leg and foot.  Recommends continued treatment.   
04-21-1998 Treatment prescription for NovaCare from Dr. DeLong.  Continue program.   
06-12-1998 Physical therapy notes from NovaCare.  Main complaints are pain across the lower 
back bilaterally.  Numbness and tingling essentially unchanged.  AROM in L-spine is 50% in F/E; 25% in side bending; 50% in rotation.  SLR is 60/75 on the right and 
left with no aggravation.  Active hip fl exion is 120 degrees bilaterally.  Sitting 
tolerance is 15-20 minutes, walking is one hour. Still has difficulty walking on 
uneven ground.   
06-15-1998 Handwritten notes from Dr . DeLong.  Pain in right lower extremity is better.  (?) 
numb but thigh an knee pain are (?) fine.  Le ft great toe got (?).  Walked with limp.  
Developed L3 (?) and T/L ache (?).  Something looks good -- can’t read.  
Recommends partial press-ups.  He tolerated these well.  10 reps q.i.d.  Continue PT. 
 Something (?) gym program.  Re-evaluate (?).   
 
 18 07-02-1998 Letter to Dr. Bowen from Dr. Hsu.  He discusses the placement of an X-fix 
distraction implant of the lumbar spine for spinal stenosis in January 1998.  His 
symptoms did not improve.  On May 01, 1998, he underwent surgical decompression 
with laminectomies.  His leg pain resolved following the surgery and he was discharged on May 09.  He has SLR to 80 de grees bilaterally and is neurologically 
intact and wishes to begin physical therapy.   
08-25-1998 Handwritten notes from Dr . DeLong.  Doing well.  (?) has residual numbness in right 
leg, lateral lower leg.  No pain, and (??) aching in low back.  Recommend continue PT.  Re-evaluate in four to five months.   
08-25-1998 Chart notes from Dr. Hsu.  Mr. Arken is improving.  After the March 1998 surgery 
his right lower extremity pain resolved.  He still has numbness in the right leg which 
is tolerable.  He has intermittent low back  pain which is worse with movements of 
his back and activities.  SLR is to 80 degr ees bilaterally and he is neurologically 
intact except for numbness in the right leg.  He is continuing with physical therapy.   
01-20-1999 Handwritten notes from Dr. DeLong.  Appears to be six letters separated by a slash 
mark and I cannot read any of it. 
01-20-1999 Letter to Robert Taylor, M.D., from Dr . DeLong.  Mr. Arken is considerably more 
comfortable now and has improved over his condition of May 21, 1997.  He still has aching in the right leg, especially duri ng cold weather, and he has numbness around 
the knee and inferiorly into the foot.  If he  moves suddenly or if he misses a step he 
develops severe jolting pain in the back and right leg.  He also notes aching in the leg 
when he lays down at night.  If he limits his activities he remains relatively comfortable.  He can flex only to touch th e knees.  He can extend only five degrees.  
He walks on his heels and toes and there is no weakness of specific muscle groups.  
There is hypalgesia over the dorsum and lateral aspects of the right foot as well as over the lateral aspect of the left foot.  DT Rs are absent at the right knee, 1+ at the 
left knee and 1+ at the ankles.  SLR is  possible to 60 degrees on the right and 70 
degrees on the left.  He’s advised to continue to limit his activity and to perform stretching and other exercises taught to him by the physical therapist.  As for the C-
spine he continues to have complaints there.   These are left sided and located at the 
base of the neck and radiating into the trapezius muscle to the shoulder.  He only has occasional aching in the left upper extremity now.  Previously the symptoms went to 
the thumb and index finger of the left ha nd.  ROM in the C-spine is moderately 
limited in all directions.  Strength is int act and sensation is intact.  He has a 
prescription for a cervical MRI scan and is goi ng to get a series of facet injections in 
the neck and/or cervical epidural injec tions depending on the findings.  This will 
come from Dr. Hsu.   
03-30-1999 This is the report by Dr. Gartland of the cervical spine MRI without  contrast.  At C2-
3 there is some facet degene ration, but the boney diameters are normal.  C3-4 there is 
a moderately large disc/osteophyte complex which is greatest in extent in the right paracentral region and extending into the ri ght neural foramen.  This comes into 
contact with the ventral surf ace of the cord on the right side and appears to flatten it 
slightly.  There is bilateral facet hypertrophy as well and there is a resultant moderate 
stenosis of the right neural foramen with s light narrowing on the left  side.  (I seem to 
 
 19 missing the second page and have only the third page of this report.)  So, I am 
missing descriptions of C5-7 and the firs t diagnostic impression.  The second one is 
“left sided disc/osteophyte complex with resultant marked narrowing of the left 
neural foramen at C5-6 and moderate central  canal stenosis with some flattening of 
the left side of the cord on it’s ventral su rface”.  The third one is “uncinate and facet 
hypertrophy with resultant compromise of ne ural foramina at multiple other levels, 
as described above”.   
03-30-1999 Letter to Dr.  DeLong from Dr. Hsu.  Mr. Arken is having increasing neck and left 
shoulder and arm pain for more than si x months.  This pain has been worse 
especially on the right side for the past two weeks.  Movements of the neck, especially extension, are painful.  He’s also having numbness in the left hand.  DTRs 
are 1+ throughout the upper extremities and are symmetrical.  There is decreased sensation in the left C6 and C7 distributions.  Motor examination is normal.  The Hoffman sign is equivocal on the left side.  He is prescribing a Philadelphia collar and home traction unit.  He will be seeing Dr. DeLong for surgical consideration.  
Current diagnosis is listed as “HNP, C-spin e; spinal stenosis, C-spine; early post-
operative lumbar spine; degenerative disc disease, cervical and lumbar spine”.   
04-22-1999 Letter to Dr. Robert Taylor from Dr. DeLong.  Low back and right lower extremity 
pain remain essentially unchanged which she states is the usual level which he rates about 3-4 out of 10.  He states  he is able to tolerate the low back and leg symptoms.  
However, he has developed considerab ly more pain in his neck and upper 
extremities.  Pain involves the neck a nd both shoulders and scapular regions 
somewhat more pronounced on the left side.  He is having little in the way of radiation into the upper extremities but he has severe axial pain in the neck and 
shoulders and he has frequent headaches.  He  states that the range of motion in his 
neck is quite limited and he has to keep his head tilted forward and turned toward the right to be comfortable.  On exam ROM in the neck is indeed limited.  He can achieve only about 10-20 degrees left rota tion and 10 degrees of extension.  Right 
rotation is 60 degrees, and flexion is approximately 40 degrees.  Tenderness is noted 
over the articular pillar.  There is a sugge stion of bilateral pectoralis muscle group 
atrophy and pectoralis strength seems mildly impaired bilaterally, somewhat more so 
on the left.  There is mild weakness of tr iceps muscle bilaterally, somewhat worse on 
the left.  Other muscle groups are intact.  Th ere is hypalgesia over the radial aspect of 
the left hand including the thumb and inde x finger and there is hypalgesia over the 
ulnar aspect of the right hand.  Deep tendon reflexes show an absent left triceps 
response, 1+ right triceps and biceps, trace brachioradialis, absent knee and ankle reflexes.  No pathological re flexes.  He reviews x-rays and cervical spine MRI and 
agrees with the radiologist’s findings.  He  notes that there is moderate narrowing on 
the left neural foramen at C4-5 with osteophyte present posterolaterally on the left.  The changes at C4-5 are not as severe as at C5-6 and C3-4, but are nevertheless significant.  His impression is “cervical s pondylosis, multiple levels, most severe at 
C5-6 and C3-4, present also at C4-5, with axial cervical pain and bilateral radiculopathy”.  He is recommending surgery.  Options include anterior approach at only the worse level, C5-6, or the two worst levels at C5-6 and C3-4.  However, this 
 
 20 leaves the possibility of having to return to  C3-4 with a second surgery.  Therefore, 
he’s recommending a three level anteri or cervical decompression and interbody 
fusion with titanium plate fixation utilizi ng bank bone.  This would require a halo 
brace post-operatively.  If surgery is not opted for he is recommending surgical 
epidural block with Dr. Hsu.   
04-22-1999 Letter addressed To Whom It May Concern from Dr. DeLong.  He is commenting 
that, despite the lumbar surgery, he continue s to have chronic low back and leg pain 
and physical therapy is able to keep him comfortable.  He needs long-term 
maintenance physical therapy to remain func tional and avoid further back surgery.   
05-11-99 Deposition of Mr. Arken by Mr. Sinclair. There is a comment that a nickname for 
Mr. Arken is E-boy. Page 6  Asked if he is disabled, he replies that he is disabled-
retired.  Page 7  First hired in 1971.  Last worked on September 29, 1996.  He has four years of college.  Page 8  He is a member of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers Local Union 415.  Page 9  He desc ribes low back pain radiating into the 
right leg and right foot and numbness.  It’s below the waist level and top of the buttocks area going down into the right butto ck, hip area, and then rolling over into 
the upper thigh, burning of the knee and then  down into the lower leg and into the 
foot.  The hamstring is very tight in th e back.  He has symptoms on both the dorsal 
and plantar aspects of the foot (tingling) .  He has numbness in the leg.  Page 11  
Primary location of pain is in the lowe r back towards the right side where the 
incision was and then down into the leg.  Pa in is described as aching and constant.  
This becomes a burning sensation in the low back with flare-ups.  He also gets an 
electric shock-like symptom into the right lower extremity.  Page 12  This occurs early in the morning when he is in bed.  Clarification for symptoms on the thigh it is 
on the top (assuming upper) and front.  N eck symptoms described on Page 13.  
Burning sensation and difficulty looking up or down.  It comes down the neck and 
into the left shoulder primarily, however , it has switched to the right one just 
recently.  It is persisting on the left but now on the right as well.  Pain is worse on the left.  He has difficulty l ooking over his left shoulder and turning to the left and 
looking up as if you were looki ng at an airplane.  He experiences numbness in his 
neck and burning into the shoulder area if he  sits too long.  Page 14  He has some 
pain between the shoulder blades going upwards  to a “knot” in the back of my neck.  
Back pain aggravated by reaching for something above the shoulder when he’s been sitting too long.  He also has symptoms into the left elbow and then in the left hand, 
thumb, and three digits.  The forearm is sk ipped.  So this is thumb, second, third and 
sometimes fourth digits.  Occasionally th e fifth. Page 15  He describes symptoms 
over the whole hand as if going asleep and this  occurs when he’s in bed or when he’s 
reaching for something.  Difficult to tell wh ether it’s the front or the back.  No 
symptoms in forearm but an ache and radiati on in the arm.  Mr. Arken asks if he may 
stand during the questioning (apparently he’s  uncomfortable sitting down).  Page 16  
Back to questions about the leg and foot.  Medial side of foot and top are more 
affected.  He has some sensa tions into the toes (tingling) and some stabbing pain into 
the big toe occasionally.  Describing a sens ation of being poked with something in 
the middle posterior aspect of the right bu ttock.  Page 17  Originally the back was 
 
 21 more painful than the neck.  The neck pain seems to have started in 1996.  He did 
mention it to his physician,  Dr. DeLong.  He refers to an incident down in Port of 
Stockton.  September 1996.  He was a switch engine locomotive engineer.  He said 
he’s had back symptoms since he had surgery in 1979.  He recovered from that very well and then had a collision problem in 1990.  He really deteriorated after the 
incident down in Stockton.  In 1979 he had low back and sciatic problems.  These symptoms radiated all the way down the back  of his leg (all the way down).  He says 
these were not the same symptoms he has now .  He doesn’t seem to have sciatica this 
time, he says.  He doesn’t recall if he ha d numbness or tingling at that time or if he 
had shooting pains. Page 19  Continuing, he says that it was difficult for him to recall 
the exact symptoms that he had but it was sc iatica and very difficult to step up or step 
down and almost impossible to bend down.  He  says the symptoms were similar to 
what he is having now.  He has difficu lty bending now and sitting and can’t reach 
down with my foot “I have to bring my foot up to me when I put my shoes on, something like that.”  Page 20  He desc ribes recovering fairly well from the 1979 
surgery but had occasional flare-ups.  He be gins to describe his injury/incident in 
1990.  He was an engineer on an eastbound tr ain standing stationary with the brake 
set in Roosevelt.  He was in the yard.  Pa ge 21  “I believe it was late afternoon or -- 
well, somewhere in the afternoon.  I can’t recall.  Switch crew was working up above 
me, and they left the switch open to my track and kicked four loaded cars on down 
into my track, and I did not see it, and they hit my standing engine and train at about 10, 12 miles an hour.”  He said he di dn’t see it and was knoc ked around and knocked 
down into the step well where the toilet is injuring his back, neck and shoulder.  He 
repeats this description on Page 22 and adds  that after contact with the other cars 
they coupled “into the front of my engine .”  He may have lost consciousness for a 
short period of time.  After the incident he did have periodic problems with his low 
back.  The problems were difficulty be nding over and sitting too long, very much 
like a flare-up.  Page 23  He doesn’t recall if  he had radiating pain.  Apparently he 
was hospitalized after the incident.  And rest ed for several days.  He said his back 
and legs were hurting along with his neck a nd shoulder.  He says that he did have 
some reduction in symptoms “after surgery and physical therapy.”  And the surgery and physical therapy were pertaining to th e shoulder apparently.  Right shoulder.  
After the 1990 incident the low back sympto ms were reduced but he complained of 
flare-ups with long-duration jobs being fatigued and so forth.  Page 24  The primary claim against the railroad for the 1990 inci dent appears to have been a shoulder 
(right) injury but he also recalls complaini ng about his neck and back and shoulder.  
Asked about his low back and legs, he believe s he did not make that claim.  And the 
claim was settled.  Page 25  His current symptoms generally get worse as the day progresses.  He has difficulty also at night and when turning over in bed.  Standing or 
taking short walks seems to be better than sitting.  He gets some relief lying flat on 
his back raising his legs a little bit.  Asked about physical activities that exacerbate his symptoms, he says that he can no longe r do most of the activities he was able to 
do prior to 1996.  These include household work, chores, gardening, walking, jogging, bicycling.  He now has a housekeep er.  Page 27.  He can walk about 20 
 
 22 minutes.  Prior to the 1996 incident he c ould walk for over an hour.  More detail on 
limitations; can’t sit long periods and can’t cross his legs at all.  Difficult sitting 
without a seat back, such as sitting on the edge of his bed.  He has difficulty with 
balance sometimes when he tries to squat.  Page 29  He does have some occasional 
“misstep or stumble”.  Page 30  Back surgery with Dr. DeLong in 1997.  This alleviated the symptoms for a short duration and then the pain came back.  There were two surgeries. The first was in August 1997 and the second was in March 1998.  Apparently there was a discogram probably at the L5-S1 area.  Page 31  He believes 
the first surgery was directed there and the second one was to L4/5 and back to L5-S1.  He doesn’t recall if upper levels we re done.  After the August 1997 surgery the 
pain dissipated but he still had the same sy mptoms and they didn’t seem to get any 
better.  They were worse after PT.  Page 32   He then had a series of injections.  But 
this did not work out and they went to  the March 1998 surgery.  That seemed to 
alleviate a lot of the pain but he still has right leg symptoms with numbness and tingling.  He feels his back is still weak.  Page 33   He also is affected by the cold.  This is with increased stiffness and easier aggravation of the pain.  Referring to the 
Stockton Port job he’s asked how soon he consulted with his doctor.  He says he thinks it was mid October.  Apparently  he was going in for some urological 
procedure and complained of his low back pain at that time and was sent across the 
street to his former surgeon who did th e 1979 surgery, Dr. Nagel.  Page 34   Dr. 
Mooney is the urologist.  Urological condition has not been related to the low back.  Rather I should say has not been related to the low back by any of the treating 
doctors.  After the 1979 incident his back di d remain weak but, he said, comfortable 
with some flare-ups periodically or if he  worked too long.  Pa ge 35   Now he has 
flare-ups if he misses a step or if he bends  to get in or out of  bed without a lot of 
caution.  He has two to three flare-ups a m onth now.  These flare-ups are related to 
activity.  He’s asked whether, during the course of the day, he’s reasonably comfortable and answers no.  It deteriorates after I’ve been up for about four or five 
hours and it’s all down hill in the afternoon and in the evening.  Page 36   He uses a 
recliner at home.  This is apparently so me kind of a French made chair for persons 
with back problems.  He’s asked whethe r his pain affects his concentration and 
answers, definitely.  Page 37   He has c onstant leg numbness.  Dr. Robert Taylor is 
the family practitioner.  Prior to 1997 his priv ate doctor was Dr. Palma.  Page 38   He 
has been seeing Dr. Wideman (female) si nce 1993.  She was his primary provider.  
Prior to that it was Dr. Bill Tellman.  Currently, Dr. DeLong is taking care of the neck problems.  He is also seeing one of Dr. DeLong’s associates Dr. Ken Hsu.  He’s 
not presently seeing any chiropractors or osteopaths.  Nor is he getting pain management or physical or occupational th erapy.  He is not presently seeing Dr. 
Nagel.  After the 1990 incident he did not treat with an orthopedic surgeon for his 
neck or back.  Page 40   He saw Dr. Stev en Weber for his shoulder (? which side).  
Apparently additional surgery has been  recommended by Dr. DeLong.  Page 41   
This consists of cervical spine surgery.  Last saw Dr. DeLong last month (April).  
Apparently there are problems demonstr ated by MRI at C3, C5 and C7.  The 
proposed surgery is the anterior fusion which will be a three level fusion with 
 
 23 titanium plate.  Page 42   He’s going to  get a second opinion and a third opinion.  
MRI was done at St. Mary’s in San Francisco in January of this year.  The proposed 
third opinion doctor as regards to surger y is Dr. Laura Anderson.  Page 43   
Currently he takes over the counter medi cation for pain (Tylenol, Motrin and 
aspirin).  Page 43   He takes it as neede d, not on a regular basis.  Asked about his 
first recollection of any back pain, his answ er is 1976. Page 45  Th is is what required 
the 1979 surgery.  Apparently there was anot her flare-up in which he consulted with 
Dr. Nagel for in 1988.  Page 46   Cervical sp ine stiffness is primarily in the A.M.  
Stiffness lasts maybe an hour to an hour a nd one-half.  He gets problems later on in 
the day.  He describes his low back stretchi ng regime.  Page 47-48   There aren’t any 
stretches or exercises he can do for his n eck.  Page 49  He gets three and one-half 
hours of sleep maximum per night.  He wakes with both back and neck pain.  This is 
more than eight times per night.  He deni es any problems with his jaw but describes 
the burning sensation in the shoulder bilaterally, primarily the left one.  Page 51   He’s asked about pain or stiffness in th e ribs and answers that he has some but 
doesn’t know what it’s from.  He has some pa in in the elbows, primarily the left.  He 
is right hand dominate.  Asked about pain  or stiffness in his fingers, he says 
somewhat.  Page 52  There is some ques tion about a discrepancy in the records 
regarding nine knee surgeries.  He deni es any.  Page 53   Some discussion of 
stiffness and other symptoms in the right a nkle.  Page 54  There is a question about 
gout and pseudo gout beginning on Page 55.  He  has not been diagnosed with gout.  
He denies any other incidents at the railroa d that would have contributed to his neck 
or back problems.  Page 56-57   He also denies slip and fall accidents, motor vehicle 
accidents, etc.  No fractures.  He is 6 feet tall and weights 216 pounds.  He smoked 
early in life but is now a nonsmoker.  He  describes his optimal weight at 175.  
Weighs the most he’s ever weighed now due to inactivity.  Page 58  Asked about 
sports played growing up, he played basketball, baseball, track, football, touch.  Page 60   He played basketball and football dur ing his first years of high school.  He’s 
asked about daily activity.  Most of his d ecrease in walking as a form of exercise 
occurred subsequent to the 1996 incident.  Page 61  He describes playing a lot of 
tennis prior to his first back surgery.  Page 63   He denies being treated for 
alcoholism.  Page 66   He ‘s asked whether he’s ever been told by a physician that he 
suffers from depression, and then later sa me question regarding low self esteem.  
Objections from plaintiff’s counsel.  No answer.  Page 67   Same question with 
regards to chronic pain syndrome.  The an swer is no.  Page 68   Same question as 
regards to brain injury or central ner vous system disorder.  Plaintiff counsel 
objection again and Mr. Arken is advised not  to answer.  Page 68  Same question 
regarding psychiatric or psychological treat ment.  Same objection, no answer.  He’s 
asked whether he’s had any disciplinary probl ems at the railroad.  Yes.  This related 
to his over running a red signal.  Page 69   He apparently took a 30 day suspension 
for that.  Apparently there’s some discu ssion of whether the court reporter’s records 
reflect the number of times Mr. Arken has b een forced to stand due to some back 
discomfort.  Page 74  There is a discu ssion of training and experience regarding 
“slack action”.  Presumably, this refers to the approaching of  two railway cars and 
 
 24 Mr. Arken describes balancing grades co ming off the mountain territory, gathering 
slack gently coming in against the engines and using your dynamic brake a little bit 
more and more until you have it all gathered  up.  Page 76   He’s asked whether a 
skilled engineer can control “slack action” in the yard.  He answers that it’s difficult sometimes because you don’t have a profile like you have on the road that tells you 
where the loads and the empties are.  Page  77   When gathering up trains out of a 
bowl and taking them up -- called a trim-up to the place of the train, you have no idea 
where the loads are.  Page 78    You can  hit pretty good with slack action coming off 
the hump.  He’s been a locomotive engineer  since 1975.  Page 79   He’s asked about 
a condition of “run-in”, and is  asked what conditions or circumstances that occurs in. 
 Answer is, when coming off a grade onto a flat.  Page 80   Also, if the wrong brake 
is used too much or used at  all, you could get real severe  action.  Page 81   He also 
mentions that “if you have to jam it fo r some reason, you will get a run-in”.  
Apparently he has a special seat that he  uses in his work and has since the 1990 
incident.  Page 83   This apparently was simply a seat modification device that fit 
over the regular sit.  Page 84   He descri bes how may of the seats on the locomotives 
were in bad repair or  hanging off the side  of the wall frame and not well-maintained. 
 Page 85-87    
06-24-1999 Neurosurgical second opinion from Laura Anderson, M.D.  This is addressed to Dr. 
DeLong.  He is complaining of numbness in the hand that occurs in the thumb, index 
and middle finger on the left side.  He also has pain radiating predominately into the 
left proximal upper arm.  The hands bothe r him more at night.  No weakness is 
noted.  Valsalva maneuvers do not exacerbate the pain.  Symptoms are aggravated by sitting and/or rotation of the head which is bothersome when driving.  Spurling sensation with rotation  is negative.  Sh e reviewed the MRI study of 03-30-99.  He’s 
had no discograms, no physical therapy, no chiropractor treatment, and no epidural 
steroid injections for treatment.  He ha s no dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesis.  The 
patient has 5/5 motor strength in upper and lower extremities.  No atrophy.  DTRs are 2+ and symmetrical in the upper extremitie s.  The patellar reflex is absent on the 
right, 0-1+ on the left; Achilles reflex is  1+ and symmetrical.  Sensory exam is 
remarkable for some hypesthesia in the radi al portion of the left forearm and thumb.  
Tinel’s is negative at the wrist.  He has tenderness over the ulnar nerve in the region 
of the medial epicondyle bilaterally.  No pathological reflexes.  Her assessment is “multi-level cervical spondylosis with clini cal presentation of C6 radiculopathy”.  
She has informed the patient that the risk  of pseudoarthrosis and kyphotic deformity 
is very high with a three level fusion and she does not recommend it.  She also 
recommended against using cadaver bone with a three level fusion.  She also mentioned that the patient could be worked  up further in order to determine what 
level he’s symptomatic from, for example, discograms or selective nerve root blocks 
at C6.  However, looking at the MRI, she seem ed to feel that C5-6 level was the most 
symptomatic.  She recommended one level surgery.  The other consideration was a possibility of carpal tunnel syndrome, but with a negative Tinel’s sign and radial 
hypesthesia it tends to go with a C6 radiculopathy.   
07-15-1999 Letter to Robert Taylor, M.D., from Dr . DeLong.  He explains his rationale for the 
 
 25 planned cervical spine surgery.  There was a second neurosurgical opinion from 
Laura Anderson.  Her opinion was that we should only have the C5-6 level 
approached.  As a result, they have agreed to approach the C5-6  level with anterior 
cervical disc and spur excision.  They will use bank bone and titanium fixation.   
08-24-1999 This is a hospital surgical C-spine x-ra y one view.  This is post cervical spine fusion 
and films have recently become available for our evaluation.   The first two films 
show a bayonet shaped needle with it’s tip at the C5-6 interspace.  Subsequent films 
show retractors, internal fixation screws and interbody fusion grafts at this same 
level.  This was dictated by Robert Hart, M.D.   
08-24-1999 Operative report from St. Mary’s Medical Center.  Surgeons are DeLong and Hsu.  
This is page 2 of a two page report appare ntly.  I do not have page 1.  They used 
banked bone with an Atlantis titanium plate placed over the graft at C5-6 with screw 
fixation.   
08-26-1999 Cervical spine x-ray, AP/LAT.  Post-op cervical fusion.  There is fusion at C5-6.  
There is an interbody fusion graft at this le vel along with a small blade plate.  There 
are no prior films for comparison.   
08-27-1999 Discharge summary from Dr. DeLong, St. Mary’s Medical Center .  The surgery was 
described as an anterior cervical disc and spur excision, C5-6, with interbody fusion 
utilizing banked bone fibular strut graft with titanium Atlantis plate fixation, 
microsurgical technique, etc.   
09-23-1999 Letter to Dr. Taylor from Dr. DeLong.  The anterior cervical disc and spur excision 
at C5-6 was performed on 08-24-99.  He is  doing well.   The arm pain has been 
relieved, but he still has aching in the neck and shoulders.  A lateral cervical spine x-
ray today demonstrates excellent alignmen t of the bone graft, vertebral elements, 
titanium plate, and screws.  It appears th at the upper pull of th e graft has not yet 
fused, but this is to be expected only one month after the surgery.  He is wearing a 
Philadelphia collar at all times.   
10-28-1999 Letter to Dr. Taylor from Dr. DeLong.  Mr.  Arken’s arm pain remains relieved but 
he still has aching and occasional sharp pain  in the neck and upper thoracic region.  
X-ray appearance has not changed.  It appear s that the upper pull of  the graft is not 
fused and we are asking him to continue to  wear the Philadelphia collar.  The lower 
pull appears to be fusing satisfactorily.  He also continues to have right lower 
extremity pain and it has been suggested to him that he have a re-evaluation as a candidate for implanted spinal stimula tion.  This would be done by Dr. Charles 
Szabo.   
12-13-1999 Letter to Larry Lawrence, Esq.  This is  from Dr. DeLong.  Mr.  Arken is still having 
neck pain and low back pain.  On this date flexion and extension cervical spine x-
rays were taken.  The fusion appears solid.  There is no motion between C5 and C6.  
He has been instructed to taper out of his collar.  They want to start a low impact 
aerobic program in another month or so.  And also some gentle Yoga stretching.  There is a comment about his inability to  participate in a deposition last week 
because of severe agitation stemming from sleep deprivation.  This is largely due to difficulty of sleeping in a cervical brace.  He’s taking Darvocet N100 and Flexeril to 
help him sleep.

Review of Medical Reports  
 
Work-Related Injury of 1991 
 
Dr. Belcourt treated Mr. Stephano for an injury  sustained while attempting to reposition a 
seat on one of the locomotives in late Oc tober of 1991. He made a diagnosis of right 
shoulder strain. Mr. Stephano also complained at the time of some neck pain, headaches, 
and brief paresthesias in the right upper extremity.  He wa s given a home traction unit. A 
CT examination was performed and revealed a mild osteophyte formation at the C5-6 interspace and a moderate one at the C6-7 inte rspace. Neither were said to encroach the 
spinal canal. Mr. Stephano also received a ster oid injection into th e right shoulder by Dr.

Palumbo during this time. Palumbo, however, fe lt that some of his symptoms were the 
result of his mild cervical spondylosis. In January of 1992 and arthorgram of the right 
shoulder was obtained, showing no evidence of rotator cuff tear. [This test, it should be 
noted, does not allow one to rule out a partial thickness tear and does not rule out the 
shoulder as a source for pain.] During this ti me period there were also findings of upper 
extremity reflex changes, but no gross strength loss. 
 
Mr. Stephano was provided with PT at Swan son & McMahon Physical Therapy in late 
January of 1992 concerning his right neck and shoulder pain. This continued through 
about early April. He was said  to have made good progress. 
 
In a report dated 2-28-92, Dr. Jones no ted, parenthetically, that Mr. Stephano had 
informed him that he had been involved in a motor vehicle crash on the way to the appointment, but noted that there was no incr ease in his symptoms as a result of it. 
 
As a result of ongoing right shoulder pai n, Mr. Stephano had an MRI study of his 
shoulder done on 3-26-92 which revealed an acromioclavicular (AC) configuration which 
was “conducive to the development of impingement syndrome,” a condition hinted to by some of Dr. Palumbo’s physical exam findings. There was also a focal area of abnormal signal in the supraspinatus tendon under an acromial spur, which would also be consistent with that diagnosis.  He also had an MRI of the cervical spine on the same date which 
showed degenerative changes at C6-7 with some effacement of the thecal sac and some 
encroachment of the right neuroforamen, along with relatively minor spondylosis at C5-6 
and C4-5. 
 
On 4-16-92 Mr. Stephano was seen by Dr. Chu at the request of Dr. Jones. Dr. Chu made 
the diagnosis of cervical strain and right shoulder tendi nitis, recommending EMG/NCV 
evaluation of his upper extremities. This was performed by Dr. Chu on the 20th and 
revealed no abnormalities. On the 30th, he noted a complaint of low back pain over the 
past two months and added low back strain to his diagnosis (alt hough he did not mention 
any direct trauma). 
 
In August of 1992, Mr. Stephano went to Back  To Work Physical Rehabilitation and 
received a series of treatments from a Je nnifer Pudewell, R.P.T., who described him as 
“well motivated.” These sessions were appare ntly were quite successful. On 9-14-92 Dr. 
Jones returned Mr. S to full duty at the railroad without restrictions. 
 
On 6-9-93 there is an emergency room record of a visit inspired by an episode of muscle 
spasm in the “right pariscapular [sic] region,” along with some radi ation into the right 
arm. It was diagnosed as “trigger point myositis.” 
 
In a report dated 11-1-95, Dr. Merchant re ports to Dr. Taylor that Mr. Stephano does 
have what he believed to be bilateral rotator cuff tendinitis and possible right sided AC 
joint osteoarthritis. He performed another ri ght shoulder steroid inj ection on that date. A 
later report detailed marked impr ovement in his shoulder mobility.

Sporadic Chiropractic Treatments 
 
There were a series of chiropractic treatme nts administered by Dr. DePaoli. Records 
indicate this began on about 6-3-98 a nd continued through 7-24-00. Mr. Stephano 
informed me that he has been an intermitte nt chiropractic patient since the early 1970s, 
mostly for his low back which occasionally bothered him. However, there was no treatment from 4-28-00 until 6-28-00. He was then seen on 7-12-00 and 7-24-00, at which time (as was related to me by Mr. Ste phano) Dr. DePaoli told him that he should 
see his medical doctor because of his co mplaints of upper extremity numbness and 
tingling. Dr. DePaoli’s notes are not very co mprehensive and do not appear to be highly 
reflective of the actual complaints on the date s of service. Of interest was a note on 9-13-
99 that Mr. Stephano remained “status post MV A.” I asked Mr. Stephano what that might 
have meant and he had no idea. He also de nied that the previously mentioned motor 
vehicle crash incident caused any new injuri es or aggravated existing problems. This 
comment appears nowhere else in Dr. DePao li’s records and may re present a dictation 
error of confusion with another patient. 
 
Treatment for Urolithiasis in 1998 
 
On about 7-9-98, Mr. Stephano was admitted to  Sutter Roseville Medi cal Center with a 
diagnosis of urolithiasis a nd subsequently underwent remova l of a right sided ureteral 
stone without complication. On 7-27-98 he returned for further removal of calculus on 
both right and left sides. 
 
Work-Related Injury of 2000 
 
On 7-20-00, Dr. Taylor referre d Mr. Stephano to Swanson Physical Therapy for the 
treatment of left sided interscapular pain and left upper extremity numbness and tingling. 
There is a chart note on 8-22-00 regarding the fact that Mr. Stephano had not returned for 
care. 
 
On 8-2-00 Mr. Stephano was again subjected to  an MRI scan of his neck. This revealed 
desiccation of all cervical discs, with a poste rior protrusion of 4.5 mm at the level of  C4-
5, along with some foraminal narrowing and f acet arthrosis. A right-sided impingement 
was said to be a strong possibi lity. Bulging was also noted at C5-6 (2.5-3 mm) and C6-7 
(3.5 mm), where additional foraminal narrowi ng and facet changes were evidenced. On 
9-1-00 Mr. Stephano submitted to the first of  two epidural steroid (Celestone with 
lidocaine anesthetic) injections: this one at  the C7-T1 level. This was performed by Dr. 
Mowery. This resulted in some temporar y relief and the hope that the second one, 
performed at the C5-6 space on 9-27-00, would be helpful. 
 
On 11-7-00 Mr. Stephano was once again seen by Dr. Chu for neck and lower back pain. 
Examination revealed some sensory changes in the upper extremities, but no frank motor loss. There was a positive Tinel’s sign at the left elbow and he was diagnosed with neck 
strain and upper back pain, cer vical disc degenerati on at C4-5 and C6-7, left ulnar nerve

compression and left carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Once again electrodiagnostics were performed and reveled no abnormalities. [It is important to realize that one cannot rule out a sensory radiculopathy using EMG/NCV, although these tests ar e important in the 
investigation of that condition.] 
 
During this time period Mr. Stephano also had some session with an acupuncturist and he related to me that they were not productiv e. There was a thoracic radiographic series 
taken on 12-7-00, ordered by Thao Pham, M.D ., which revealed some spurring which 
does not appear to have been significant. On 1-11-01 Mr. Stephano saw Dr. Chu and was 
complaining of left upper extremity (hand) paresthesias. Acupunctu re was discontinued 
at that time and the patient was given a TENS device. 
 
Dr. Duffy wrote a report on 2- 14-02 detailing the onset of Mr. Stephano’s most recent 
problems, stating that they began in July of 2000 and that he had not had prior neck 
problems, despite the fact that his chiroprac tor had sporadically treated his neck along 
with his back and low back—a typical manage ment scheme for chiropractors, who rarely 
deliver isolated treatment to one section of the spine. Dr. Duffy briefly chronicles the various tests and interventions  that have been done to date, and concludes that Mr. 
Stephano is suffering from “symptomatic cer vical spondylosis, disc trouble, and facet 
problems.” Dr. Duffy also opined that Mr. St ephano is not a surgical candidate and will 
have to live with the pain, that this was a permanent condition, that he was disabled from 
his job as an engineer, and that he will require ongoing medical care. 
 
On 6-4-01 Dr. O’Neill performs a four-level cervical discography (C3-4, C4-5, C5-6, and 
C6-7). Unfortunately, none of these levels produced pain-concordant findings and a trial 
of facet diagnostic blocks was recommended. 
 
On 3-23-01, Mr. Stephano was seen by Dr. Prasad with complain ts of burning pain in the 
area of the lower left neck and left scapula,  along with numbness and tingling in the left 
hand. He remained neurologically intact and Dr. Prasad suggested electrodiagnostic tests 
and a cervical CT myelogram. The CT myelogram was preformed on 4-17-2001 and 
revealed a minor anterior extradural defect at C4-5 and well visualized nerve rootlets. 
The CT revealed a central protrusion at th at level. There was also a small central 
protrusion at the C5-6 level with mild efface ment of the thecal sac and facet arthrosis. 
Marginal osteophyte formation is also present at C6-7 and at the superior levels as well.  
 
On 5-1-01 Mr. Stephano was seen again by Dr. Prasad who recommended discography. 
 
On 6-18-02 Mr. Stephano was seen for ev aluation by Dr. Schofferman. He found some 
limitations of cervical spine ra nge of motion in flexion and extension (80% and 70% of 
normal, respectively) and sensory abnormalitie s at the left C6 area, but Mr. S was 
otherwise neurologically intact. He revi ewed the case and recommended additional 
radiographs and a cervical MRI. A pain draw ing rendered at the time indicated posterior 
upper back burning pain extending from the midlin e laterally as far as the medial aspect 
of the shoulder and from the middle trapezius , superiorly, to the tip of the scapula, 
Jack Stephano

inferiorly. Pins and needles wass endorsed, al so by way of the pain diagram, extending 
from the left elbow laterally and posteriorl y, extending down distally into the first three 
digits, which are involved on both the dorsal and palmer aspects. Mr. Stephano has noted 
on this form that 80% of his co mplaints are attributable to the neck and 20% to the arms, 
when asked to create a ratio totaling 100%. I note that this form provides only the lower 
back and leg pain as other choices and the pain drawing would indicate that he is 
primarily referring to what I would term upper back pain (with some lower neck pain).  
This pain was reported to be constant, varyi ng in severity with activities from 4-6/10. He 
attributed this to, “Accumulative injury ove r years of seats lateral motion and slack 
action. Bad engines.” Radiographs of the cerv ical spine (including flexion and extension 
laterals) taken on this date revealed generali zed cervical spondylosis  and “low grade disc 
disease at C6-7.” 
 
The cervical MRI dated 6-24-02 revealed anterior and poste rior spurring and loss of 
signal and height from C4-C7. At C4-5 there was a 5 mm central posterior herniation, at C6-7 there was a 3 mm central posterior pr otrusion (both unchanged from the previous 
study of 8-2-00, and both effacing the thecal sa c), and at C4-5 there was a 3 mm central 
posterior protrusion mildly effacing the thecal  sac. Canal stenosis was present from C4-
C7, along with bilateral ne uroforaminal narrowing. 
 
Upon review of these results, Dr. Schofferm an considered a medial branch block 
neurotomy (i.e., radiofrequency ablation of th e nerves supplying sensation to the facet 
joints). To determine the potential for succes s, anesthetic block of these nerves was 
planned, since he believed the earlier facet block study had been insufficient, having been 
done only at the C5-6 spinal level. Dr. Salava  performed the blocks on the left side from 
C4 through C7 on 8-5-02. The results, which relie ved pain in his “left shoulder,” was felt 
by Dr. Salava to implicate these joints as contributors to his o ngoing pain pattern. One 
day later it was reported by Paul J. Slosar, M.D. (same office as Dr. Salava) that the pain 
had diminished to a 1/10, but the arm numbness was unchanged. Mr. Stephano was 
requesting a surgical consultation on this day be cause he had to travel a great distance to 
get to this center and, apparently, he wanted  to maximize the productivity of his trip. 
However, Dr. Slosar’s feeling were that since the C4-5 and C6-7 levels were the most problematic, they would both have to be opera ted, leaving what he termed a “nutcracker 
effect” at the C5-6 level. The only alternative would be a four level fusion and he did not 
recommend it at that time. Meanwhile, he t hought neurotomies of the facet joints might 
be effective. 
 
Dr. Schofferman saw Mr. S again on 9-05-02. He mentioned that Dr. Slosar had not been 
keen on a surgical solution. Thus, additional f acet injections (block s with steroid this 
time) were planned. The new assessment on this report was “probable cervical facet 
syndrome.” On 10-18-02 Dr. Salava performed the facet injections once again, and again 
reaching both the medial branch and the intraa rticular space, this time noting total relief 
of his “low back and arm pain,” (presumabl y referring to the left upper back pain). He 
also injected the right AC join t and that relieved his right sh ould pain, implicating, to Dr. 
Salava, the right AC joint. However, a s ubsequent report (11-13-02) by Dr. Schofferman 
Jack Stephano 
Page 6 of 19 
  
noted a lack of steroid effect from this la st injection series. Ne vertheless, on 12-20-02 
Mr. Stephano underwent medial branch neurotomy at the left  C4 through C7 levels, the 
procedure performed by Dr. Salava. 
 
On 1-28-02 Mr. Stephano was seen by Dr . Carragee for a medical examination. He 
recorded the fact that Mr. Stephano complain ed mostly of his upper back pain, and only 
secondarily of the left forearm and hand num bness and tingling. He also noted that Mr. S 
was having no treatment at all currently and that he was also taking no medication and 
receiving no physical therapy or chiropractic care. Later, he did note that Mr. Stephano 
told him of his reliance w ith sleep medications, however. He mentioned that Mr. 
Stephano had been feeling “blue” about his pr oblems at work and early retirement. Upon 
examination, he reported a full range of moti on in the shoulders and neck, but did not 
mention specific ranges or how this motion was determined to be normal. Neurological 
and other examination findings were essentially benign. His dia gnoses included “self-
reported upper back pain,” “self-reporte d bilateral hand pain and finger sensory 
complaints with no objective evidence of se nsory loss on careful neurologic testing,” 
“history of a normal electrophys iological study,” “history of shoulder arthritis,” “history 
of chronic low back pain,” “obesity and ge neral deconditioning,” and “mild situational 
depression.” At the time of his rendering of these opinions he had yet to view most (or 
perhaps all) of the imaging studies that had been obtained, and he deferred comments 
regarding Mr. Stephano’s ability to return to work until he had seen these studies.  
 
The wording of these diagnoses is unusual in th at the nature of the process is for patients 
to inform their physicians what their subj ective complaints cons ist of and they are 
always, by definition, “self-repo rted.” As for numbness, this cannot be objectified, except 
on the basis of a pinwheel or other sensory examination, and this requires the patient’s 
subjective report also. The nor mal electrophysiological studies  allow us to rule out 
peripheral neuropathies, such as carpal tunnel syndro me and other entrapment 
neuropathies, but do not allow us to rule out sensory ra diculopathies or brachial 
plexopathies, and certainly have no diagnos tic value in the cas e of scleratogenous 
phenomena. The term “situationa l depression,” is a term chie fly used by non-psychiatrists 
to describe a feeling of discouragement or sa dness which has some type of realistic basis 
(e.g., loss of a career or a family member, beco ming disabled, etc.) to distinguish it from 
the more orthodox terminology used by the Amer ican Psychiatric Association in their  
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders  (e.g., dysthymic disorders, major 
depressive episodes, affective disorders, etc.) which Mr. Stephano does not appear to 
suffer from. 
 
However, it is important to note that objectif ication, while challenging, is not impossible. 
It is also likely that Dr. Ca rragee’s opinions will change to  some degree after viewing the 
numerous diagnostic reports. 
 
The most recent report that I have is that of a contrast-enhanced MRI of the thoracic 
spine dated 4-16-03 which disclosed minimally  bulging discs at levels T1-T5, with a 
moderate broad-based disc protrusion noted at  T5-6, and mild central disc protrusions at 
Jack Stephano 
Page 7 of 19 
  
T5-6 and T8-T12. Minor facet arthrosis was also noted at the lower two levels as well as 
at T2-T4. There was also some effacement of the thecal sac at T5-T7, T6-7, T9-10, and T11-12. At T5-6 the deformity of the spinal cord was characterized as moderate. 
 
I have reviewed a report prepared by Dr. J ohanning after his examination of other records 
and of Mr. Stephano himself. The report was dated 12-1-2002.  He reviewed the medical record. Upon examination of Mr. Stephano, he  reported a reduced cervical spine range of 
motion with some discomfort, and some defic it in side bending (lumbar) to the left. He 
also noted a mildly positive Phalen’s test  on the left side. No  other neurological 
abnormalities were noted. His diagnosis was “a ccelerated cervical spine degeneration and 
disc herniation, cervical neur opathy, and spondylosis with ne rve root involvement.” He 
attributed these conditions to work-related cumulative trau ma, described the prognosis as 
poor, and opined that Mr. Stephano will likely need surgery in the future and will probably continue to have life-long pain  and discomfort and possible additional 
neurological sequelae. This ch aracter of this work-related tr auma was described as both 
excessive vibration and the unpredictabl e shocks encountered while operating 
locomotives. Contributing factor s include the seats installed in those vehicles which did 
not offer suitable protection against these forces. He concluded that Mr. Stephano will not be able to return to his work as an engine er and that he has permanent, total disability 
from his railroad employment. 
 
 
Review of Non-Medical Reports 
 
George B. Page, CPE  I have read a report entitled  “Preliminary Report Regarding 
Switch Stand And Switch Conditions And Thei r Operation At Union Pacific Railroad 
Facilities In California.”  This report is dated October 11, 2002. In the introduction, Mr. 
Page explained that the purpose of the re port was to “assess whether switch stand 
operation exposes employees to putative risk factors associated with the development of 
musculoskeletal disorders of the low back, like degenerative disc disease of the low 
back.” Mr. Stephano does not have low back pa in or degenerative disease of his lumbar 
intervertebral discs as a signifi cant or prominent part of his complaint and, therefore, the 
relevance of this report and its attachments (A-D) may be somewhat marginal. No force measurement, load calculations, or risk es timates were made for the neck or cervical 
spine, or for the thoracic spine. Neverthele ss, I did read the report and do have a few 
comments on it.  
 
Mr. Page tested a total of 27 switches of the UP system in Californi a during the course of 
the operation of these switches. Th e operator was described as a 95th percentile male 
subject. The report contained no description of the devices or  equipment used to measure 
these forces, or any source of validation and/or calibration of this instrumentation. One wonders what the known error rate of these measurements is. These measurements were 
then analyzed using a “biomechanical computer model” to estimate low back compression forces which were, in tun, compar ed to the reported upper and lower criteria 
as promulgated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety a nd Health (NIOSH). 
Jack Stephano 
Page 8 of 19 
  
This software was also not named, although it bears some identification as coming from the University of Michigan (from screen captu re illustrations in th e attachments), and no 
literature was cited regarding the software’s va lidity in terms of its ability to accurately 
and reliably determine what it purports to determine. 
 
Attachments A-C illustrate a series of these switch-throwing tasks in the form of a photograph of the 95
th percentile male subject, a comput er model of the subject in the 
same or similar position, and the computer  screen indicating, among other things, the 
load calculated to be imposed on the low b ack (no specific vertebral level identified). 
 
One wonders how representative the 27 switches that were tested were and how these specific switches were selected for testing. A carefully conducted sc ientific trial would 
require some type of randomization scheme to eliminate the possibility of selection bias. Leaving that issue aside, however, one wonders why a 95
th percentile male was selected 
for this assessment. Mr. Stephano, for exam ple is 5’ 10” and weighs 249 lb. From a 
height perspective, this places him the 50th percentile male range. On page 2 of his report, 
Mr. Page indicated that this was “for worst-case scenario purposes ,” without explaining 
how comparing the results of te sts using a larger male to that of a smaller male would 
logically accomplish this goal. In none of the switch-throw ing tasks did the 
measurement-based and computer-calculated low back loads exceed NIOSH criteria for 
low back compression. If this were chiefly a low back case, it would be important to 
consider other forces, such as torque, rotati on, and shear, since these forces are not only 
known to be injurious to discs, but are also  considered more injurious than pure axial 
loading. It is not clear why the computer m odel did not make (or wasn’t asked to make) 
those predictions. It would also be important to know how well validated the NIOSH criteria are in terms of risk for low back in jury, particularly in regard to the specific 
ergonomics of switch throwing.  
 
Mr. Page, on page 9 of his report, stated th at “no controlled, epidemiological research has 
been reported that demonstrates that a pr ior exposure to certain levels of back 
compression (e.g., above NIOSH’s lower or upper cr iteria) poses an elevated risk of low 
back injury or disc degeneration several year s (e.g., 5 to 10 years) in to the future.” This 
comment appears to suggest that the only forces which need be considered are 
compressive loads, and I would disagree. More over, the only valid wa y of assessing these 
risks would be to study railro ad workers in such a controlled epidemiological study. The 
lack of such a study does not offer any assurances  to the relative safety of these combined 
loads on the low back. As it is said in epid emiological circles, “A  lack of proof of 
correlation is not the equivalent of a proof of a lack of correlation,” particularly when the 
study has never been done. 
 
Attachment D shows a series of common everyda y tasks, such as lifting a child out of a 
car, lifting a box from the trunk of a car, et c. These were also evaluated using the 
aforementioned computer model to demonstrate that some everyday activities place the lumbar spine within a similar loading corrido r as manual switch opera tion. Most of these 
tasks, of course, are not repetitive and are not usually  performed under the demanding 
Jack Stephano 
Page 9 of 19 
  
conditions of shift work. Moreover, again, Mr. Page has not taken torque and other forms 
of stress into account. 
 
 
Neil K. Cooperrider, Ph.D., P.E.  I have read a report entitled “Ride And Impact 
Measurements On Union Pacific Locomotives  Operating In California,” written by Dr. 
Cooperrider. Dr. Cooperrider described the re sults of measurements taken on trains in 
revenue service and during certain yard ope rations in California. These tests were 
conducted on locomotives equipped with the older pin and key adjustment and attachment seats as well as some with the ne wer, spring-loaded, quick  release attachment 
mechanism. The report noted that the measur ements were taken in accordance with SAE, 
ISO, and ANSI guidelines and that these meas urements were interpreted on the basis of 
the ISO Standard and the British Standard BS684, both of which recommend a vibration dose value (VDV) for impact situations.  
 
Vibrations were measured by attaching a triaxial block of accelerometers to the 
engineer’s or conductor’s s eats and another block to th e floor of the locomotive. 
Recorded data was processed following the standards mentioned, including “weighting of the data to account for varia tions in human sensitivity w ith frequency vibration,” this 
latter procedure not expl ained in the text.   
 
Accelerometer data must be measured with  high frequency since peaks of acceleration 
can occur in as little as 50 msec. Typically, in our crash testing, we record continuous 
data at 1000 hertz, such that one data point is recorded for each millisecond. This requires 
intensive storage capacity. Dr. Cooperrider did note that they had developed a method to 
record “nearly continuous data ,” but did not describe it in  any detail, nor did he note 
whether that method had ever been subjected to a rigorous validation study to determine 
its accuracy, reliability; whet her any clipping, truncating, or smoothing of data was used, 
etc. 
 
Because the accelerometers were attached to (a) the seat itself or (b) the floor of the locomotive, virtually all of the conclusions drawn on page 8 of his report are potentially erroneous. This is particularly true of  the conclusion number four: “The impacts 
experienced during yard operations, slack acti on, or other transient situations are well 
below the action level of the British Sta ndard.” I have, on two earlier inspections, 
examined the seats of a number of locomotives in the yards of UP in  Northern California. 
In every case, the seats were not securely mounted to the floor of the locomotive but 
instead were placed in a sleeve which allo wed them to wobble grossly when sat upon. I 
have also interviewed Mr. St ephano and other UP engineers who have commented on this 
situation. With the accelerometer attached to a seat that can  move potentially 
independently of the intended subject of intere st (i.e., the employee ri ding in that seat), 
artifacts will be induced and the seat itself cannot be cons idered a reliable proxy for the 
subject on the basis of acceler ation. In other words, the ac celeration of an object that 
moves independently of the object whose accele ration is actually measured may be quite 
different. That is likely to be more so in lateral and horizontal accelerati on than in vertical 
Jack Stephano 
Page 10 of 19 
  
acceleration. Moreover, in order to determin e the acceleration of a body, it is necessary to 
measure that acceleration over its center of grav ity. This clearly was not done in the case 
of the mounting positions on the seats, and is even more incorrect in the instance of the 
floor-mounted accelerometer block. The subject’ s center of gravity would not coincide 
with that of either the seat or the floor of  the locomotive. In point of fact, the head 
accelerations measured in human subjects exposed to low speed rear impact car-to-car crashes (which would produce pulses similar to those of sl ack actions and other minor 
collisions during some train operations), are known to be significantly higher than those 
of the vehicle itself—often 2-4 times higher (1-3). Moreover, rear impacts result in 
accelerations that are 3-4 times higher that front al impacts, all other factors held constant 
(4-6). There is an implied assumption in Dr . Cooperrider’s report th at the acceleration of 
the subject and the locomotive are equivalent, but this is not usually the case. In short, the 
only way to obtain valid and re liable measurements of a locomotive operator would have 
been to instrument the operator himself and it is a bit surprising th at they did not do so. 
 
Dr. Cooperrider compared some of the measurem ents obtained in the trains to those of 
other activities. The comparison in vertical weighted rms (root mean  square) acceleration 
values measured on trains to the use of other vehicles such as power boats traveling at 30-
40 knots, heavy trucks at 60 mph, small cars, subway vehicles, mountain bikes, etc., is misleading and provides little in  the way of assisting us in  assessing risks for railroad 
workers. While standards may require the ca lculation of rms valu es for acceleration on 
the basis of human tolerance to vibration, a single high-level spik e of acceleration can 
potentially be injurious, but cannot be apprecia ted when averaged into an hour or more of 
recorded data. Clearly, in rms-reported data, significant peaks of accel eration are lost in 
the averaging process: they only contribut e to the mean values. To determine the 
magnitude of a potentially injurious event, it is necessary to view the peak acceleration, 
and not to obscure potential injury-thr eshold exposures using rms calculations. 
Apparently, for the through freight operations , the isolated impacts resulting from slack 
action, making joints, traversing cross-overs, en countering switches, and bad spots on the 
road—each of which constitute potentially injurious accelerations—were averaged under 
the methodology of the VDV method of the ISO Standard. Yet these are the events most likely to have affected the cervical spine of  Mr. Stephano and peak acceleration would be 
more informative. Moreover, in the consider ation of slack actions  and abrupt lateral 
motions experienced on a locomotive, it might be more meaningful to compare them to 
the 
horizontal  accelerations of  collisions  experienced in these other vehicles. 
 
Dr. Cooperrider reported the results of a study done in 1999 in which velocity changes 
and accelerations were record ed during the collisions that occurred during coupling 
operations or while pushing a train over the ya rd hump. Details of the methods used were 
not described in this report, but presumably th e methods were the same or similar to those 
employed in the other tests mentioned above. In as much as the subjects themselves were 
not instrumented with accelerometers, some ex trapolation is required in order to estimate 
the subject’s exposure (for reasons explained above). Th ese velocity changes and 
accelerations were compared with those of a Ford F-150 pickup truck under heavy 
braking. However, this is potentially mislead ing for a number of reasons. Because it is 
Jack Stephano 
Page 11 of 19 
  
necessary to place one’s foot on the brake to  effect a stop, it implie s that the occupant 
(driver) is aware of the impending event.  Epid emiological and clinical literature in the 
area of low speed automobile crashes point to a significantly greater risk for injury when subjects are unaware of these impending crashe s (7,8). Recent tests have also confirmed a 
difference in the kinematic responses betw een aware vs. unaware subjects (9) which 
might explain the differences in outcomes s een in aware vs. unaware real world crash 
victims. If an acute injury risk is greater in  unaware subjects, it is likely that the risk for 
cumulative injury is also greater in this st ate. Additionally, the acceleration of the pickup 
truck under hard braking cannot exceed about 1 g as a result of the coefficient of friction 
of most roadways and the composition of comme rcially available truck tires. In contrast, 
the acceleration resulting from low speed impacts in cars can result in head linear 
accelerations of up to 10 g, even in crashes below 7 mph delta V (10). Based on the physical descriptions of these slack action and other unexpected events which were described to me during my interviews with Mr . Stephano and other engi neers, it is likely 
that these occasional jolts are more comparable to these low speed car-to-car crashes than 
to heavy braking in a pickup truck. And, it is  clear that not all of these events are 
anticipated by the engineers. 
 
Notwithstanding these criticisms or cautions , it appears that the maximum velocity 
change obtained by Dr. Cooperride r or his colleagues in at th ree of these tests exceeded  
2 mph. In a recent crash test study, 29% of te st subjects suffered minor, acute injuries 
(i.e., neck pain or headache not requiring tr eatment) in velocity changes of 2.5 mph and 
38% in 5 mph velocity changes (11). Thus, th e likelihood that these events in the yards 
and other sections of track might constitute a ri sk for cumulative trauma is high. It is also 
important to be concerned that Dr. Cooperrider’ s tests were done over a limited period of 
time which might have precluded the capture of  a fully representative range of data, since 
these more serious accelerations as described to me by Mr. Stephano and others do not necessarily occur on every shift. Thus, the da ta may not be fully representative and may 
have underestimated the risk.  
 
Dr. Cooperrider also strapped a triaxial accelerometer block to his lumbar area and 
performed a number of ever yday activities such as jogging, stepping down, etc., and 
reported that the vertical acceler ations measured were generally higher than those of the 
UP trains. In my discussions with Mr. Stephano and other engi neers, the pulses that are 
said to be most physically challenging are those of lateral swayi ng—especially over loose 
track and coupled with the wobbly seat—and the jolts from abrupt coupling actions, 
kicking cars, slack action, etc., which are hor izontal in the fore-t o-aft direction. These 
individuals do not generally complain about  the vertical loading path, although this 
factors into the various sta ndards vis-à-vis vibration.  
 
 
Jeffry C. Lotz, Ph.D.   Dr. Lotz authored a report dated 11-15-02 and I have 
reviewed it. His opinions were based on a review of the medical record (most or all of 
which I have also reviewed), as well as on the reports of Mr. Pa ge and Dr. Cooperrider 
discussed above. Specifically, Dr. Lotz was of  the opinion that the “vibration exposure” 
Jack Stephano 
Page 12 of 19 
  
the Mr. Stephano experienced during his occupation would not accelerate lumbar, thoracic, or cervical disc dege neration. In support of the conc lusion he offered a reference 
to a 1999 paper which did allow that e xposure to whole body vibration might be 
associated with increased risk for back pain and degenerative spinal changes, but 
declared the epidemiological literature to be  insufficient to “defin e a clear link.” I note 
that none of this literature deals with the cervical spine and, therefor e, Dr. Lotz’ reference 
does not support his conclusion regarding the cervical spine. 
 
Dr. Lotz was also of the conclusion that the seats that were available on the locomotives 
used by Mr. Stephano were “reasonably safe.”  This was based on his reading of Dr. 
Cooperrider’s report. However, this was not exactly the c onclusion of Dr. Cooperrider. 
Dr. Cooperrider compared older and newer seat s and stated that the whole body vibration 
levels on the older seats were not higher th an those of the newer seats. This does not 
imply their either seat is reasonably safe, nor  can that conclusion be drawn on the basis of 
Dr. Cooperrider’s study design. It ma y not be clear to Dr. Lotz that the issue of horizontal 
motion is correlated to seat w obble, but the issue of vibratio n is but one of the putative 
events under discussion with these seats. He noted that his own observations of engineers 
during their work revealed no sustained non-neutral postures and ranges of motion were not exceeded. Although riding on the locomotive is likely to enhance one’s understanding 
of the work in general terms, for the basis of evaluating whether e ngineering is generally 
(or always) safe it provides no more than an anecdote, since it may very well have been that no adverse exposures occurred during those rides.  
 
Dr. Lotz was also of the opinion that neck or back injuries wo uld not be more likely as a 
result of “typical operations” in which lo comotive impacts occurre d. In support of this 
opinion he noted that the peer-reviewed publis hed literature on crash testing defines a 
somewhat higher injury threshold for velocity  changes from car-to-car impacts compared 
with the data obtained by Dr. Cooperrider.  However, the limited number of events 
measured by Dr. Cooperrider would not be sufficient to establish whether his observations were actually representative of all yards, under all conditions, any more than tossing a coin in the air four times would provide sufficient information to make any 
statement about its balance with any degr ee of confidence: the study, by design, lacks 
statistical power. This was, in fact, one of the chief limitations of the two papers cited by 
Dr. Lotz, as my colleagues and I pointed out (12).  
 
There currently is no known lower boundary thre shold for injury on the basis for velocity 
change, and these studies do not provide a scie ntifically valid one as Dr. Lotz suggested. 
It is noteworthy, however, that the authors of  both of these studies were of the opinion 
that a velocity change of 5 mph was in the neighborhood of the threshold for cervical 
injury. However, some time later it was shown that this threshold was much lower (e.g., 29% injuries were observed at velocity ch anges of only 2.5 mph)(11). And these crash 
test volunteers were screened with MR I prior to crash testing, given physical 
examinations, were generally free of known ri sk factors, were aware of the impending 
crash, and were mostly between the ages of 20 and 40 years of age. Thus, by design, in order to ensure the highest de gree of protection for test subj ects, researcher necessarily 
Jack Stephano 
Page 13 of 19 
  
bias the study in terms of its external valid ity, and real-world occupants will generally be 
at greater risk than crash test volunteers. Mo reover, a very importan t distinction here is 
that these volunteers (incl uding those of the two studies mentioned by Dr. Lotz) were 
exposed to a very limited number of tests, whereas the issue in the case of Mr. Stephano 
is whether a large number of such exposures (some perhaps more severe and the majority 
probably less severe) over a 30-plus year period would accelerate de generative changes 
in the spine. Finally, Dr. Lotz stated that “there is no mechanism described in the medical 
literature that would suggest these impacts have  any adverse health consequences.” This 
is not at all the case and comments such as this reveal Dr. Lotz’ lack of familiarity with this large literature. In fact, these mechanis ms have been widely discussed (13) and the 
epidemiological and clinical literature clearl y define these low speed impacts as a sizable 
public health problem, costing more than $19 billion annually (14,15). 
 
Dr. Lotz noted that interverte bral disc degeneration and b ack pain are common in middle-
aged adults, citing the statistic that degenera tive changes or other spinal pathology can be 
seen in 30% of asymptomatic individuals. Ho wever, it is scientifically improper to 
compare two disparate populations, as Dr. Lo tz is doing. For example, Mr. Stephano has 
neck and back pain and he also has a degenerative spinal condition. He belongs, 
therefore, to a population of  spinal pain sufferers. The people comprising the 30% 
asymptomatics with degenerative conditions co me from a population without spinal pain. 
It is simply illogical scientifically inappr opriate to make any comparison between these 
two populations. Moreover, the ta cit suggestion in offering this comment can only be that 
Mr. Stephano might actually belong to the 30% group of asymptotic persons and is, 
therefore, malingering. This, however, was neither suggested by Dr. Carrageen, who examined and interviewed him, nor by any other providers in this ca se. I realize that Dr. 
Lotz is neither a physician nor an independent  medical examiner, and may not be familiar 
with the medical procedures described in the medical records he  reviewed, and he 
apparently has not met Mr. Stephano. In my experience as an independent medical 
examiner, however, while malingerers (or thos e who exaggerate real claims) are usually 
willing to undergo a variety of  non-invasive examinations such as radiographs, CTs, and 
MRIs, and are sometimes also willing to submit to the independent medical examinations, endless treatment sessions, a nd the various adversarial legal adventures 
necessary to bring a case to tr ial, it is nearly ludicrous to  suggest that a rational person 
would also submit to the relatively painful and invasive procedures Mr. Stephano has 
experienced (e.g., multiple-level discography, myelography, facet joint blocks, epidural steroid injections, and medial branch radiofrequency nerve ablations at multiple facet joint levels) for any other reas on than to hope to alleviate his suffering. These procedures 
are not only painful, but fra nkly dangerous; and it is very  unlikely that Mr. Stephano 
would not have been informed of these risks by the providers deliveri ng the services. It is 
difficult to imagine anyone submitting to those tests and procedures merely to promote a false claim. I found Mr. Stephano to be rati onal and intelligent, and he gave a rather 
straight-forward accounting of his experiences with any signs of embellishment. 
 
Dr. Lotz, in his final conclusion, stated that, “one cannot conclude that Mr. Stephen’s work environment while at UP  caused musculoskeletal inju ries to his neck or upper

back,” yet, considering the opinions he ma de earlier in this report, he was able, 
apparently, to conclude that it could not. 
 
 
Interview with Mr. Jack Stephano 
 
I met and interviewed Mr. Stephano on 5/20/2003 in Sacramento, CA 
 
History of Present Illness 
 
Mr. Stephano worked approximately 33 years with  the railroad. He related to me that he 
liked his job very much. At the time of his disablement he had, what he termed, the most 
preferred job. He worked one and a half trips a week However,  for all but for one to two 
years in the “Rules Car,” where he was inst ructor, he was otherwise constantly exposed 
to what he described as, “a lot of loose track or bad switches that throw you from side to 
side; and slack actions are an everyday occurr ence.” Four axle (GP) units are worse than 
6-axle (SP) units for this. He  was driving a lot of the 4-ax le units. These were mostly 
found in the locals. Mr. Stephano also compla ined that the posts of the seats in the 
locomotives were worn out. Some, he noted, ha ve been like that since he joined the 
railroad. He would call the service track out if  they were really bad. The resulting seat 
wobble and instability compounded the problems  of loose tract, bad switches, and slack 
actions by allowing the seat occupant to be  more violently thrown around in the seat. 
Sometimes, he told me, he knew where the bad spots were and could brace himself. This 
was often not the case, however. Most trains  traveled at about 45 mph. On a 60 mph train 
you got potentially slammed around more, but th ere was not much lateral motion around 
the mountain; no high speed track.   
 
Mr. Stephano is a 64-year-old man who appear ed his stated age and gave me a straight-
forward account of his history with the railroad and his medical history to date. He 
appeared to me to be sincere and honest, a nd left me with the impression that he was 
neither fictionalizing nor exaggerating his cu rrent complaints. He is 5’ 10” tall, and 
weighs approximately 230 lb. Currently he is wearing what he desc ribed as a lidocaine 
patch for upper back pain, which was given to him by Dr. Schofferman. He reported that 
they were difficult to place correctly by himsel f and he usually had his wife assist him in 
placing them in the correct location. There was some evidence of this from marks made by the sun over a previous lower location. 
 
By way of his work history, Mr. Stephano rela ted to me that he had suffered a low back 
injury while working for the railroad in the early 1970s. Shortly after that he began seeing 
a chiropractor for his occasional low back complaints and has tried to seen him on a 
monthly maintenance basis si nce that time. I asked hi m about Dr. DePaoli’s note 
regarding the MVA status (noted earlier) and he told me that there was no other motor vehicle collisions except for the one noted earl ier in this report. He related to me that 
while going to see Dr. Jones on 2-28-92, he was starting off from a stop sign and a 
woman, coming out of a driveway, struck his right front fender from the right 
Jack Stephano

perpendicular direction. He was driving a full sized 1989 Chevrolet pickup. She was 
driving what he described as a small car. His truck was damaged and was not driveable 
from the scene as a result of damage to th e front wheel. He is not  aware of her condition, 
but she did not appear to be injured. A police report was apparently made. He denied having any increase in his symptoms that he had at that time (see record review above), 
nor did he experience and new symptoms as a result for this crash, and he did not see any 
health care providers for evaluation concerning the crash. It woul d appear that Dr. 
DePaoli’s “MVA” comment was made err oneously—possibly out of confusion with 
another patient—because it appeared only in the one of several daily records and does not match any of the diagnostic codes used. 
 
Mr. Stephano described the work injury of 1991 in which he injured his right shoulder. 
He demonstrated how he bent forward to adjust the locomotive seat. In lifting and 
moving it from his left to his right he felt a tw inge in the right mid trapezius region which 
seemed, at the time, to be trivial, but by the next day was very pain ful. That history was 
consistent with the medical records I had previously reviewed and which are 
encapsulated above. The company, he says, sent  him to all the doctors he saw in 1991. He 
told me that he requested the Back to  Work group therapy because he’d heard good 
things about them and because he had not b een making mush progress with the therapies 
that had been provided up to that point. Dr. Chu, he added, wanted him to retire if his 
condition did not resolve within six months. He was treated at Back to Work for about six 
weeks and then he felt ready to go back to work.  
 
The most recent complaints, and the ones that now have him unable to work, began in July of 2000. He was seeing the chiropractor when he informed the doctor of the left 
upper extremity numbness and tingling and the chiropractor thought that it would be a 
wise idea to consult with his medical doc tor. He believes it may have been the 
chiropractor that first introduced the term cumulative trauma  to him. The subsequent 
history—which is also encapsulated above—was  consistent with wh at Mr. Stephano told 
me about his current predicament. 
 
He first saw Dr. Taylor. He ha d left sided thoracic pain in the medial scapular/rhomboid 
region. Dr. Taylor recommended an MRI and PT. Massage, he said, did help. The PT 
lasted a few weeks. By his next trip on the railroad, however, he was worse. For this pain 
he was prescribed medications that prevented him from working due to the narcotic side 
effects of drug, so he was then taken off wo rk. He told me that he did have some 
additional PT, and would have liked to have had more, but he felt he couldn’t afford to 
keep paying the required insurance co-payments. 
 
Regarding the 12-20-02 neurotomy procedure described above, I asked him what the 
outcome of that procedure had been. He told me that it hurt, but that there had been no other effect at all. Although it is  not currently painful, he can still feel where they inserted 
needles. It was simply not effective in relieving any of his complaints.

Current Chief Complaints 
 
His primary complaint is that of left poste rior thoracic pain which he described as 
burning, constant, and ranging from 4/10 to 6/10 in severity. This is relieved by massage 
and the wearing of the lidocaine patches, wh ich he uses about 12 hours out of the day. He 
also takes antiinflammatory medication on a regular basis. Aggravating factors include sitting in low-backed chairs which do not s upport his spine, although it is not necessarily 
important to rest his head to be comfortable.  High backed chairs allow him to be fairly 
comfortable. This pain began spontaneously in July of 2000 with no precipitating factors 
that he can determine. The pain is seated primarily in the area of the left scapula, consistent with the pain drawing described earlier. 
 
Secondarily, he complains of numbness and tingl ing in the C6 sensory region of the left 
hand (first three digits) which, as it progresses in severit y, moves proximally to involve 
the dorsolateral aspect of his forearm as high as the elbow. He  informed me that this was 
a problem that he believed he could otherwise work with, but that the back pain was what 
actually precluded him from working. These ha nd/forearm symptoms do not appear to be 
correlated directly with his back pain, alt hough both are more or less constant. Also, in 
contrast to the back pain, he is not aware of any specific fact ors that increase these upper 
extremity complaints. His left palm is numb all of the time. He described the sensation as feeling the way it feels after you catch a hardball with th e palm of a baseball glove 
instead of in the trap portion. 
 
He has no major complaints directly referabl e to his neck. He does notice some crepitus 
with motion of the neck, but I did not measure his range of motion.  
 
His shoulders, he said, haven’t been a probl em since about 1992. In this case I was 
inquiring as to his anatomical  shoulder (i.e., the glenohumeral  joint) as opposed to the 
trapezius ridge or the scapular  region, both of which some patients and doctors refer to as 
the “shoulder.” 
 
Current Medications 
 
Mr. Stephano is currently taking Lipitor for hypercholesterolemia, Lotrel for hypertension, Doxazosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia, Ambien as a sleep aid, Baclofen (and one other he doesn’t recall th e name of) for (antiinflammatory) pain, and 
some vitamins. He also wears the lid ocaine patches for pain control. 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
Based on my review of medical records and non-medical records, and on my interview 
with Mr. Stephano and previous inspection of a number of locomotives and their seats, it 
is my conclusion that he suffers from an  accelerated and widespread degenerative 
condition of his cervical and thor acic spines as a result of more than 30 years of exposure 
Jack Stephano 
Page 17 of 19 
  
to (a) unsafe levels of whole body vibrati on and (b) frequent la teral and fore-to-aft 
unprotected and frequently unexpected hor izontal accelerations caused by low speed 
collisions of his locomotive. These most often occur during slack actions, kicking operations, unexpected collisions—or unexpectedly  severe collisions, and as a result of 
sections of loose track which laterally acceler ate the locomotive occupant. All of these 
accelerations are actually compounded by poorly designed seats which fail to protect the 
occupant by providing a solid  attachment to the locomotive floor. This spinal 
degenerative condition has been largely progr essive, yet unrecognized by Mr. Stephano 
and his physicians as such until about July of 2000, when his condition began to deteriorate to the degree that he was no longe r to perform his usual occupation as a result 
of pain. It is further my opinion that Mr . Stephano remains totally and permanently 
disabled from his usual occupation as a loco motive engineer and I would not expect any 
significant degree of remission or resolution of his condition in the future. He will be in 
need of ongoing medical care. It is also likely that in the future hi s condition may further 
destabilize—neurologically and biomechani cally—necessitating surgical intervention. 
 
I would concur with those who have been of the opinion that he is probably not an ideal 
surgical candidate at this tim e, however. While it is possible that a four level fusion 
procedure (C4-C7) would relieve many of his complaints (and obviate the potential 
nutcracker effect concern raised  earlier), it would n ecessitate the fusion of more than half 
of his entire cervical spine. Moreover, there is evidence that  some of the thoracic discs 
might be contributing to his curr ent clinical picture, so widespread are the changes. Thus, 
surgery at this time would be rather risky in  my opinion, particularly since the discogram 
was non-concordant.  
 
I believe that much of Mr. Stephano’s complaints can be explained on the basis of scleratogenous phenomena, as opposed to di rect compression or ir ritation of neural 
structures (although there could we ll be an element of that too). These pain pathways are 
well established (16-19). This would explai n the temporary effect noted during the 
epidural injections, shoulder steroid injections, and facet jo int injections. They provided 
some degree of modulation of these complex pa in pathways by way of feedback, but did 
not affect a long-term change or disrupt any pain cycle. Moreover, discs and facet joints 
are two of the common sources of spinal pain  in degenerative conditi ons, but they are not 
the sole causes. As the discs efface the th ecal sac, it becomes irritated and this can 
produce the pain patterns that Mr. Stepha no complains of. These bulges become worse 
during certain motions of the neck whic h can aggravate the irritation over time.

Summary of Medical Records 
 
Dr. Labennette was stopped in the roadway on 9-1-95 waiting to turn into a driveway when he was struck from the rear by a young woman named Jennifer Weiss. According to statements made in her deposition, her rate of travel was approximately the posted speed limit and she did not apply any braking action prior to impact. It may also have been a slight downhill section of road. From numerous statements in these records, Dr. Labennette’s car was pushed forward some 100 or more feet after impact. He does not believe he lost consciousness, but does have some minimal degree of posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) which is characteristic of concussion. 
 
Dr. Labennette stated that he did not have his head turned and was not aware of the impending 
crash. He also reported that he thinks he struck his head on the sunroof and head restraint. There is also a note in a letter to Dr. George Snowmaker from Dr. John Mahon that he may have seen his daughter’s car seat during his rearward excursion. This would be consistent with the very high impact speed of the crash injury and would attest to the extreme cervical spine extension motion that resulted. This would also be consistent with the relatively high vehicle speed change that would have resulted in this crash scenario. 
 
After the injury he was transported to the hospital where he was examined and radiographs were taken. These showed “mild degenerative disc disease at C5-6.” He was then seen a short time later by a chiropractor named Hattier who described various physical findings and subjective complaints of neck pain and upper extremity complaints. Also during this immediate post injury period Dr. Labennette was seen by George Snowmaker, DC and by two of his associates in his own office who rendered certain deep massage therapeutic techniques to him. 
 
On 9-7-95 MRI studies of both the cervical and lumbar spines was reported by Frank DuPont, III, MD. He noted mild straightening of the cervi cal spine, mild posterior disc bulging at C2-3, 
C5-6, and C6-7. At the latter places some evidence of degenerative change was present, probably consistent with age. Degenerative changes were also noted in the lumbar spine along with spondylolisthesis of L4 on L5. 
 
Visual analog pain scale ratings were noted to be as high as 9 in Dr. Snowmaker’s records. Other limitations are noted on this form.  He also has checked confusion, depression or crying spells, dizziness, headaches (daily and unrelieving), loss of sleep, muscle jerking, and numbness.  He is 
Jeffrey Labennette, DC

March 7, 2000  
 
 said to be unable to work as a doctor of chiropractic, sit, stand, drive, play golf, play tennis, ride 
bike, etc. 
 
There is an automobile accident questionnaire form from the office of Dr. Snowmaker.  The MVC is described in some detail.  Dr. Labennette has noted that his car was moved approximately 150 feet south from the point of impact.  Pain after the crash included: hands, 
wrists, back of neck, mid back, low back complaints.  Checked symptomatology include: headaches, neck pain, neck stiffness, nervousness, irritability, dizziness, head feeling heavy, pins and needles in arms, sleeping problems, pins and needles in legs, numbness in fingers, numbness in toes on the left, loss of balance, fatigue, and back pain.  There is also a comment about fear of riding as a passenger and being concerned with having cars behind him.  He denies any prior complaints in these areas and notes that he was able to work before the crash but is not able to work after the crash.  He has not retained an attorney.    
 
On 09-19-1995 there is a modified Oswestry disability questionnaire from the office of Dr. Snowmaker.  Scores ranges from 2-5 with the average being 3 or 4.  Total score for this yields a figure of 64% disability. There are several follow-up reports from Dr. Snowmaker describing relatively severe pain ratings and disability scores.  
 
On 10-06-1995 Dr. Snowmaker finds tenderness and positive orthopedic tests.  Reflexes are 2+ 
with the exception of the left biceps which was 1+.  Sensory changes are noted.  It appears to say right hand and much hypesthesia with pain.  Cervical spine ROM (goniometer) is described as: flexion 40 degrees, extension 40 degrees, right late ral flexion 25 degrees, left lateral flexion 20 
degrees, right rotation 40 degrees, and left rotation 40 degrees.  All are associated with pain and restriction.  These are significant restrictions and are commensurate with a significant injury. 
Foraminal compression and shoulder distraction are said to be positive.  There is a positive Libman bilaterally.  Grip strength is 80/70/60 on th e right and 90/85/80 on the left.   Muscle tests 
reveal biceps on the right as 3/5.  Lumbar ROM is: flexion 40 degrees, extension 25 degrees, right lateral flexion degrees, left lateral flexion 15 degrees.   
 
On 9-22-95 there is a radiology report from Dr. Terry Yochum.  Cervical spine MRI.  Patient was referred by Dr. George Snowmaker.  Noted is spondylosis, including decreased disc height, 
marginal osteophytes, and rostrocaudal subluxation at C2-3.  Mild posterior disc bulging and ventral thecal sac effacement is also noted at this level.  Circumferential disc bulges are present at C5-6 and C6-7 with some ventral thecal sac effacement.  No evidence of frank herniation.  There is also flattening of the cervical sagittal curve, possibly secondary to acute muscular antalgia.  Radiology report from Dr. Terry Yochum.  Lumbar spine MRI.  Impressions include multi-segmental discogenic spondylosis; degenerative anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 secondary to moderately severe posterior joint arthrosis at this level.  Less pronounced facet arthrosis is noted at L5-S1; levorotary scoliosis of the lumbar spine; asymmetrical posterior soft tissues.  Clinical correlation, he notes, is necessary to exclude paraspinal muscular atrophy.

On 11-08-1995 there is a modified neck pain and disability questionnaire form from the office of 
Dr. Snowmaker indicating a large disability score resulting from neck complaints. He also had Dr. Labennette complete a physical capacities questionnaire on 11-08-95 and his various limitations are described. Sitting and standing are limited to one-half hour.  Walking for one-quarter to one-half hour.  No alternative sit-stand, sit-walk, or stand-walk is allowed.  He can lift 10-15 pounds occasionally, carry 10 pounds occasionally, or push-pull about 20 pounds occasionally.  Simple grasping for repetitive action is not possible on either side.  No fine manipulation is said to be possible.  He cannot squat, kneel, crouch, crawl, climb ladders, or bend/stoop.  He can occasionally climb stairs or reach overhead.  Classifications of his 
capabilities ranges between sedentary and light.   
 
On 11-16-1995 we find a letter to Dr. George Snowmaker from Dr. John Mahon describing Dr. Labennette’s “severe” condition and noting various complaints characteristic of postconcussion syndrome (PCS), noting that he is depressed, irritable, and suffering from insomnia; also posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) such as  nightmares, dreams, and flashbacks. He noted, “I think reflects very definite concussion given the instant headache and the associated trauma which he reports.”  He also noted, “I am be ginning medication and given his present situation, 
which I consider rather severe, along with medication, I really think he needs to rest.” He does not allow Dr. Labennette back to work. He finds  severe spasm and other findings which also 
point to an injury that is quite significant.  He  did not perform a mental status examination but 
feels there is no abnormality of cognitive function based on conversations with Dr. Labennette.  Impressions include: concussion with subsequent PCS; post-traumatic stress syndrome; flexion/extension injury to the neck; lumbar strain; headaches secondary to the first three.  To be ruled out is:  subdural hematoma; traumatic  neuropathy probably involving both ulnar and 
median nerves; possible contusion of the spinal cord; insomnia, severe with sleep deprivation; depression as a result of head trauma and his associated concussion and PTSD.   
 
On 11-21-1995 we find typed notes from Dr. Ma hon.  Mrs. Labennette called.  She says her 
husband is very confused and disoriented and sh e doesn’t think he should be driving so Dr. 
Mahon told her to tell him not to drive.  He apparently called to cancel a morning appointment which he didn’t have and Dr. Mahon suspect he was quite confused. This is also consistent with the pattern of PCS. 
 
On 11-22-1995 we find typed notes from Dr. Mahon.  “Due to Dr. Labennette’s confusion he should be kept off the road and I have told both his wife and him that.”  There is a discussion 
about an argument with the wife and Dr. Mahon insisted on calling her even though Dr. Labennette didn’t want him to.  He is depressed.  He is non-suicidal by his own testimony and he’s looking forward to his vacation but he’s feeling very guilty because he can’t care for his practice and his wife says he doesn’t take his medication until around 11:00 and this is the reason he’s not sleeping.  He’s given a prescription for Ativan to take as needed and he again

 mentions having him see a psychiatrist which he doesn’t want to do.  He explained to Dr. 
Labennette’s wife that his difficulty in concentration, memory, and irritability are all related to the accident. This is classic for a moderate to severe PCS. 
  
On 11-27-1995 we find a confidential patient introduction form from Duffy Clinic of Chiropractic.  Current symptoms described were bilateral upper extremity numbness, tingling, burning.  Cervical spine pain, stiffness, spasm; mid thoracic spasm, restrictions in the lumbar and lumbosacral pain bilaterally and persistent left lower extremity sciatica with numbness of foot (heel and ball).  There is also a chiropractic examination form on this date from the same clinic.  Various levels of paraspinal discomfort are listed.  This form is essentially blank with the exception of notations regarding limitations of movement and pain in the cervical spine, but with no range of motion listed.  There are also some daily notes describing various complaints.  He was treated from November 27
th through December 2nd (five visits).   
 
On 12-07-1995 we have a EEG report by Dr. John Mahon.  This is a normal waking and sleep EEG, but does not rule out PCS. On 12-07-1995 there is a typed note from Dr. Mahon.  Dr. Labennette’s back with his wife Joye.  “I talked to them at length and they’re having a lot of difficulty with the changes that have been forced on them because of Jeffrey’s illness.  He has been unable to function in the office because of th e accident and his wife brings out the fact that 
he’s losing patients in a considerable number.”  He’s instructing Joye (Dr. Labennette’s wife)  to increase his medication to 75 and then 100 mg of Amitriptyline in the near future.  He thinks Dr. Labennette is sleep-deprived and this was going to have to be corrected before his depression would clear.  He reiterated that he should continue with chiropractic [treatment]. 
 
On 01-31-1996 an EMG/NCV study was carried out in both median and ulnar nerves and upper 
extremities.  This is from John K. Mahon, M.D. (neurologist).  The latency of all nerves is normal except motor nerve conduction velocity across the elbow segment of the right ulnar nerve where there is minimal slowing.  EMG shows 4+ fibrillations and 3+ facilitations in the right opponens pollicus muscle.  The study is said to be compatible with bilateral CTS and strongly suggestive of involvement of the ulnar nerves at the wrist as well.     
   
  On 04-22-1996 there is a letter to Dr. George Snowmaker from Kim Atkinson, DO.  Dr. 
Labennette is seen in the Neuromuscular Clinic today.  The usual symptoms.  It is noted that a few days after the accident he also developed low back pain with radiation down the left leg to the ankle.  He’s also had multiple episodes of confusional state which lasts, on average, approximately two hours but can last up one day.  He cannot make decisions, calculate, or conduct analytical thinking.  He describes a burning dysesthesia in the right little and ring fingers as well as the medial surface of the arm to  the shoulder with weakness of grip.  He also 
states that he has paresthesias of the left hand in the little finger and ring finger that extends a little bit above the wrist.  He also complains of mild weakness and grip in the left hand.  There is also pain radiating from his low back to his left  buttock.  He also has a dull, achy, straining type

 of discomfort in the left occipital area which has been present since the accident but is less 
intense now.  It’s present continuously.  The confusional spells occur two to three times per week.  He’s been told that he occasionally stares.  His sleep is interrupted two times per week due to discomfort in the right arm.  It is difficult for him to sleep secondary to the pain.  He sleeps only three to four hours at a time and then has trouble falling back to sleep.  Deltoids are graded 4+ bilaterally as are the biceps with give-away weakness bilaterally.  Grip strength on the right is 4-/5 and on the left 4+/5.  His interossei are 4/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left.  EHL on the left is graded 4/5.  DTRs are 2+ in the upper extremities and knees and 1+ at the ankle.  He has decreased pinprick bilaterally in the ulnar distributions including the middle finger [sic].  On the right the decreased pinprick extends in the medial surface of the arm to the axilla.  He has decreased pinprick in the L4-5 distribution in the bilateral lower extremities.  He has decreased vibratory sense at the toes and the ankles.  Proprioception is normal.  Rhomberg is negative.  His gait is antalgic and he favors the left leg.  Cervical spine ROM is limited in both lateral directions to 50 degrees.  Neck flexion is normal and he has limited extension.  No degrees given.  Dr. Atkinson also reviews an EEG whic h was performed on 12-07-95 and read as normal 
for sleep and awake states.  Also reviews MRI reports. The conclusion is that Dr. Labennette has multiple problems most likely as a result of the MVA of September 1995.  Repeat EMG was ordered.  Some of his signs are not consistent solely with distal ulnar and median nerve disease.  There is a question of injury to the plexus.  It is recommended that he continues with physical therapy and he has been given a prescription for Flexeril.  They have ordered an EEG with sleep deprivation and nasopharyngeal leads to rule out partial complex seizure disorder originating from the temporal lobes.  These symptoms could also be due to post-concussion disorder or a combination or anxiety and depression.  With regard to the low back he is encouraged to continue with conservative modalities. 
 
Here we have evidence of the long-lasting effect of the PCS, indicating that it was a rather severe case.   
 
On 07-29-1996 there is a letter to Dr. George Snowmaker from Dr. Terry Hyman-Patterson.  She notes that she originally saw Dr. Labennette with Dr. Atkinson on 04-22-96 and did the history 
and exam with him.  Apparently the Neurontin sedated him quite a bit.  He’s embarked on a regiment of treatment with MedX and Theraband therapy.  His neck is about 60% improved while his back is 80% improved.  He has only occasional headaches but does continue to get bilateral hand and arm pain and numbness with tingling, especially down the ulnar side of his hand.  It is in both hands, although the right more so than the left.  She describes some intrinsic hand weakness of 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left.  There is a decrease in sensation on the ulnar side of his hand on the right.  He is also continuing to have cervical discomfort along with electric shock like feelings down both arms, more so on the right.  Although he has CTS, most of 
the distribution of sensory abnormality is in the ulnar region.  He also had negative Tinel signs today.  She wants to continue to treat conservatively and does not feel that he can return to chiropractic manipulation where he has to any kind of heavy maneuvering or pushing.

On 08-15-1996 there is a report from Scott Dinkens, D.C. from Corpus Christi, TX.  Dr. 
Labennette  was first seen on May 22, 1996.  There is a comment that he moved to Corpus Christi to pursue another field of work since he is unable to practice in chiropractic.  Initial complaints of Dr. Labennette were right hand/fingers pain with numbness along arm to elbow and tingling and burning, left hand and left arm pa in, numbness, left less than right.  Frequent 
neck and shoulder pain.  Headaches.  Lower back pain and radiation to left leg, usually along back of leg.  Muscle spasms and radiation into mid back.  Examination findings include tenderness along the cervical and thoracic regions, limitations of cervical ROM as follows: 40 degrees flexion, 20 degrees extension, 20 degrees left lateral bending, 30 degrees right lateral bending, 30 degrees bilateral rotation with pain.  Cervical compression caused right fifth digit pain.  Foraminal encroachment tests produced left neck pain.  Right side caused right arm pain into elbow.  DTRs were normal.  Ulnar nerve test on the right hand was weak.  Lumbar ROM was: 60 degrees flexion no pain, 20 degrees extens ion with left low back pain, 10 degrees left 
lateral bending with left leg pain, 20 degrees right lateral bending, and 20 degrees bilateral rotation with decreased pain on the left.  Tests at 30 degrees caused pain in the left leg, 50 degrees on the right.  Braggart’s was positive on the right.  DTRs were normal in the lower extremities.  Sensation was normal for both upper and lower extremities.  He was treated with manipulation and ultrasound and electrical muscle stimulation.  He was also given ambulatory 
traction for his lumbar disc.  He then had Schwinn air-dyne exercise bike, MedX lumbar extension rehabilitation program and cervical McKenzie exercises along with Theraband progressive resistant exercises.  He made marked improvement over three months of treatment.  Low back pain and leg pain almost completely gone, headaches and neck pain are reduced.  Right hand constant flexed position was improved with very little involuntary flexion.  He still 
has upper thoracic pain and numbness and tingling in the arm/hand.  He briefly reviews a few 
other reports including those of Drs. Roth and Cavallo, noting that they did not perform an examination.  There is a comment about a return to Dr. Hyman (M.D.) (Terry Hyman-Patterson, M.D., from Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Hospital) in July 1996 in which she felt his back and cervical pain had improved and recommended further conservative care.  Dr. Dinkins does not believe that Dr. Labennette will be able to return to manipulation as a practice because he cannot do any heavy maneuvering or pushing.   
 
  On 12-16-1996, now more than one year after his injury, we have an initial evaluation on Dr. 
Labennette for Dr. Terry Patterson from Gulf Coast Rehab.  Two page report signed by Marvin Schmoyer, Jr., P.T.  He is complaining of constant numbness and “electrical” pain through the right arm in an ulnar nerve pattern with radiation into the right side of the neck.  He also experiences weakness in both hands and wrist, right  greater than left, and is unable to use his 
right hand for most functional activities.  He is reported to have a thoracic kyphosis, right shoulder elevation, right lumbar/left thoracic sco liosis, right pelvic elevation, left scapular 
medial rotation and right ankle pronation.  He  walks with right elbow flexion, left knee 
hyperextension, right ankle pronation.  Reflexes are 2+ and equal in the lower extremities.

 Manual muscle testing is reported as 5/5 in the upper extremity with the following exceptions: 
elbow flexion on the right is 4+/5, elbow extension on the right is 4/5.  Wrist flexion, extension, finger flexion, and opposition is 3+/5 on the right.  Opposition on the left is 4+/5.  Wrist flexion is 4-/5.  Wrist  extension and finger flexion is 4/5.  There is some minor loss of shoulder abduction on the right.  Paraspinal muscular spas m is noted.  He reports increased burning and 
superficial pain in response to light touch along the medial epicondyle.  This appears to be referring to the right side. Three months of two to three times weekly PT is recommended.   
 
On 06-23-1997 we find a letter to Dr. George Snowmaker from Ferhan Beken, M.D. (neurology resident).  Symptoms are described in a consistent manner with the rest of the records.  There is also a note of some buttock tingling, numbness, and pain on the left.  Physical therapy is helping momentarily but it is not permanent.  Motor exam shows positive Tinel signs on the Erb point and ulnar groove tenderness on the right side.  He also has right three-finger flexion posture on the ulnar side.  He has weakness of the opponens of pinky, and he has ulnar interossei weakness.  The left iliopsoas is 4+/5, left tibialis anterior is 4/5, otherwise 5/5.  DTRs are 2/4, brachioradialis is 1/4.  Right hand sensory exam shows diminished pinprick, light touch in splitting the second ulnar finger from the third one, which is the lower trunk distribution.  He also has left foot toe light touch and pinprick diminished [sic].  Impression is cervical and lumbar radiculopathy proved by MRI but they would like to repeat the cervical MRI.  It’s recommended he continue with PT.  Another diagnosis is brachial plexus traction injury vs. TOS.  He’s getting stretch exercises.   
 
On 07-08-1997 there is a radiology report from Dr. Terry Yochum.  Referral is by Dr. Labennette.  This is a review of cervical spine MRI dated 06-26-97 performed at MR Imaging of Lehigh Valley, Allentown, PA.  At C2-3 there is degenerative loss of disc height and signal intensity, consistent with mild to moderate disc degeneration.  Diffuse posterior disc bulging is also present at this level and there is a slight retrocaudal subluxation of C2.  Less pronounced degenerative disc disease with circumferential disc bulging is seen at C5-6 and C6-7.  There is no acute disc herniation.  The dimensions of the spinal canal and neural foramina are adequate.  There is central deformity of the C7 superior endplate.  There is not adjacent alteration in the marrow signal, suggesting Schmorl’s deformity or old compression fracture.  The cervical 
sagittal curve is satisfactory.  The endplate deformity of C7 is said to be of questionable clinical significance. Compared with the cervical spine MRI dated 09-07-95 the cervical sagittal curve shows interval improvement.   
 
On 06-01-1998 there is a report titled Existing Patient Evaluation.  It is a report signed by Darlene Guidry, P.T., and Melvin Schmoyer, Jr., P.T.  Diagnoses are multiple cervical disc lesion and multiple lumbar disc lesion.  This report is also addressed to Dr. Terry Patterson.  Chief complaints include pain and restriction in cervical and thoracic spine.  By end of day he has headaches which begin at the back of the skull.  Reports constant burning pain radiating in the top of the right shoulder and down the right elbow  into the fourth and fifth fingers.  He states 
Jeffrey Labennette, DC 
Page 9 of 28

 that the pain is in the ring and little fingers is a tingling, burning sensation.  He also reports left-
sided low back pain which radiates down the back of the left leg and into the posterior aspect of the left knee.  Physical therapy affords pain relief for approximately six to ten hours following treatment. He has moderate to severe muscle spasm and knots in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar paravertebrals, right more than left.  Reflexes are 2+ and equal in lower extremities.  Cervical spine ROM is listed as: flexion 48/60; extension 41/75; right lateral bend 34/45; left 
lateral bend 28/45; right rotation 61/80; left ro tation 60/80.  Lumbar ROM is listed as: flexion 
46/60; extension 7/25; right side bend 11/25; left side bend 7/25.  Most motion is said to take place at L2 with side bending.  There is some limitation of right shoulder motion in flexion and 
abduction.  Manual muscle testing reveals 5/5 strength in the upper extremities with the exceptions of shoulder flexion, abduction on the right which is 4+/5.  Elbow flexion is 4+/5 on the right.  Elbow extension, wrist flexion, wrist extension, mid trapezius is listed as 4/5.  Finger flexion is listed as 4-/5, and lower trap is listed as 3+/5 on the right.  The weaknesses on the left are limited to finger flexion and mid trap which is 4+/5, and rhomboids and lower trap which is 4-/5.  Grip strength measured with a hand dynamometer (brand name not supplied) is given as 38# on the right and 80 on the left at level two and 35 and 60 at level three, respectively. Dr. Labennette has been in therapy since 12-16-96 with treatment consisting mostly of myofascial massage and traction.  Compared to initial evaluation he shows minimal increase in strength in both arms and shoulders and reports improved f unction following treatment.  He was given an 
exercise program in October 1997 with limited success and exacerbation in pain symptoms and spasm.  That was discontinued.  He tolerates 20-30 minutes of general exercise now.  They’re recommending he continue with therapy.  This is to continue for the next three months.   
 
On 07-06-1998 another MRI was performed by MR Imaging of Lehigh Valley: report to Dr. Terry Patterson (M.D.) of Good Shepherd Rehab Hosp ital.  This is an MRI of the cervical spine. 
 Report is signed by Dr. Tan (M.D.).  Slight degenerative changes of the disc at all levels are again noted.  There is slight reverse spondylolisthesis at C2-3 not well seen in the previous study of 06-26-97.  This is associated with a slight to moderate central disc protrusion causing pressure on the thecal sac and touching the anterior aspect of the cord.  No central or foraminal stenosis is present.  Slight central disc bulging is again not ed at C5-6 and C6-7 causing slight pressure on 
the thecal sac only.  There is no evidence of atrophy, abnormal signals, or demyelination of the spinal cord.  The central disc protrusion at C2-3 is slightly worse in comparison with the study of 1997.  No changes between these two studies are noted at the lower levels.  MRI of the brain was done without contrast enhancement.  One tiny focal increased signal is again noted in the periventricular white matter of the right parietal lobe adjacent to the posterior aspect of the right lateral ventricle which shows no significant change in comparison with the previous study of 11-16-95 and probably is secondary to minimal ischemia.  The remainder of the brain and posterior fossa, ventricles, and sulci show no significant abnormality.  There is less abnormal signals in the left petrous apex in comparison with the previous study suggesting this to be probably due to minimal mucosal thickening with this improving.

 On 07-06-1998 there is a letter to Dr. George Snowmaker from Dr. Kleopa (neurology resident). 
 Symptoms described are consistent with the rest of these records.  They involve the neck and right upper extremity primarily.  There is also a report of low back pain radiating to the gluteal area but not to the legs.  Less severe than the arm.  He’s continuing to have PT twice a week which is helping.  Current medications include Isocol and Cipro.  These are for his Crohn’s disease.  He also takes Tylenol daily as need for pain.  His range of motion in the neck was decreased, associated with pain, when turning to both sides.  No degrees were given.  He had significant weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the right hand which was 4-/5 as well as finger flexors on the right side which were 4/5.  His strength was normal in the rest of the extremities.  There was decreased pinprick sensation in the right arm as a whole compared to the left and maximum deficits in the fourth and fifth fingers with some splitting of the third finger.  He also had tenderness along the cervical spine and medial nerve vessel bundle on the right side.  Tinel’s was negative at the carpal tunnel.  Allison maneuver was positive with painful sensation in the right arm.  DTRs were 2+/4, symmetric, and toes were flexor bilaterally.  There was no ataxia.  He is describing a brachial plexus injury.  Mostly the right side.   
 
On 03-09-1999 there is a physical therapy status re port from Berry Sullivan, L.P.T.A..  Cervical 
spine range of motion remains grossly limited, with reported restrictions being: extension to 44 degrees, flexion to 35 degrees, left lateral flexion 23 degrees, increased pain in right upper trap.  Left 29 degrees.  Left and right rotation 44 degrees.   
 
There is a report from Dr. McFarland dated 3-11-1999.  The heading of this report is IME.  Patient was wearing a seatbelt driving a 1993 Acura Legend and was stopped.  Immediate neck and headache pain, bilateral shoulder and upper extremity pain, as well as low back pain, which over the course of two hours developed a radiating component down the left lower extremity.  He struck his head against the sunroof in his vehicle and ended up with his torso between the seats of his vehicle.  He developed sensation of numbness and paresthesias down the bilateral upper extremities and was transported to ER via EMS with immobilization on backboard.  There was an MRI a few days after the ER visit but Dr. McFarland did not have it at this time.  He was also evaluated with EMGs to the upper extremity, one of which was in January 1996 demonstrating carpal tunnel syndrome and cervical radiculopathy.  In June 1996 the results were uncertain and he denies having a lower extremity EMG/NCV.  He was treated with physical therapy and chiropractic care.  He continues to have constant headache and neck pain with pain down the right upper extremity associated with numbness and paresthesias and intermittent low back pain. He also has difficulties with concen tration, occasional blurred vision, and irritability 
noticed by his wife particularly.  He has a history of Crohn’s disease and has undergone colectomy.  He takes oral medication for Crohn’s disease.  He takes occasional over the counter Ibuprofen.  He is not working.  There is attenuation of pinprick over the right hypothenar 
eminence fifth digit and medial one-half of the fourth digit.  Motor exam is physiologic.  Reflexes are symmetric in the upper and lower extremities.  Tinel’s over the carpal tunnels is positive bilaterally as is Phalen’s.  Cervical spine ROM is markedly antalgic with slow deliberate

 movements with extension to 45 degrees only.  Flexion is 40 degrees with approximately 1½  
inches from chin to chest.  Pain in provoked in the cervical region predominately with extension and rotation limited to the left at 60 degrees, 45 degrees to the right, both of which precipitate ipsilateral cervical paraspinal pain at extremes.  Lateral bending in 10 degrees bilateral.  Cervical quadrant loading is positive to the right and negative to the left.  Lumbar ROM is 50 degrees and flexion/extension 20 degrees, lateral bending 25 degrees bilaterally.  Quadrant loading is negative in the lumbosacral region bilaterally.   There is some reduced internal rotation of the right shoulder compared to the left with pain over the right superior trapezius.  Also there is pain provoked with active shoulder ROM about the medial scapular border with trigger point injections and spasm noted.  Deep palpation produces pain over the suboccipital region on the right.  This causes radiation to the mid temporal region.  Assessment includes: suggestion of cervical disc injury with radiculopathy; lumbosacral disc injury with radiculopathy vs. radiculitis; possible right ulnar neuropathy and probable bilateral carpal tunnel syndromes.  Otherwise, he diagnoses the patient with cervicogenic cephalgia of likely a cervical facet nature.  Also cervicothoracic myofascial pain and the possibility of post-concussion features subsequent to closed head injury.  He is requesting further records and scheduling an upper extremity EMG/NCV.   
 
There is a neuropsychological evaluation at the referral of Dr. Bruce McFarland (M.D.) dated 
03-19-1999.  Report is from Philip Gasquione, Ph.D.  No history of psychiatric illness or drug 
abuse. He was said to be alert, polite, cooperative, and able to tolerate the length of two 3-hour sessions. No obvious physical disability.  Expressive  speech was fluent, spontaneous.  He reports 
constant back pain, sleep disturbance, increased fatigability, emotional lability, and flashbacks of the accident scene.  He feels physically taxed.  He’s anxious about driving, has headaches on a daily basis, bilateral hand numbness (right greater than left), and is excessively bothered by bright lights and certain noises.  His wife complains of his forgetfulness.  He’s given an Wechsler adult intelligent scale test and a PASAT  and several others.  His IQ tests were within normal limits and his performance IQ was within the superior range. He was only in the 50th percentile in arithmetic.  None of his performance subtest scores were significantly below his estimated pre-injury intellectual level.  The superiority of his visual-perceptual and visual-motor abilities compared to his language abilities could have been a pre-injury characteristic.  He had no difficulty on a test of information processi ng capacity (or divided attention).  He had good 
learning ability.  As regards to motor functions, fine motor coordination, as judged by a time peg-placement task, was slowed (first percentile) in the right (dominant) hand.  It was felt that this was likely due to peripheral injury sustained in the accident.  He was moderately elevated  on the anxiety and hostility scales regarding adjustment to injury.  Depression and positive affects scales were within normal limits.  The neuropsychological test profile is described as essentially normal and suggestive that there is no significant residual cognitive deficits from his concussion.  He exhibited moderately elevated levels of generalized emotional distress but there are no recommendations for treatment at this time.  Curiously, he did not make the diagnosis of PCS, despite classic presentation and history.

On 03-19-1999 we have a nerve conduction study and EMG of upper extremities.  There is 
prolongation of the bilateral median distal sensory latencies and distal motor latencies with slowing across carpal tunnels and reduction of the motor nerve conduction velocity along forearms.  There is prolongation of the bilateral ulnar distal sensory latencies with a reduction of the motor nerve conduction velocity along forearm along and across elbow on left and relative prolongation of the F-wave latency compared to th e right.  There is prolongation of the left ulnar 
distal sensory latency.  EMG shows a low-grade de nervation of the left APB.  The paraspinal 
musculature was also tested.  Impression was: electrodiagnostic evidence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as well as left median compressive neuropathy along the forearm, bilateral ulnar neuropathies at the wrist and at left elbow.  Th ere is also left radial neuropathy at the wrist. 
 Patient will continue physical therapy and was also instructed to use a cock-up splint at bedtime.   
 
On 04-01-1999 there is a follow-up evaluation by Dr. Bruce McFarland.  Dr. Labennette 
continues to complain of constant neck and low pain with pain intermittently down the right upper extremity over the medial arm, forearm, and medial two digits of the hand and hypothenar eminence.  He has no radicular complaints in the lower extremities.  He has reviewed Dr. Gasquione’s neuropsychological evaluation.  He feel s that the motor problems mentioned in that 
report referring to the upper extremity were attributable to the motor vehicle crash of 09-01-95.  The reason for taking a job as a teacher was because of the lack of manual capacity/function to perform tasks required as a chiropractic physician.  Physical therapy is said to provide temporary relief only.  He complains of chronic fatigue a nd spontaneous sleeping episodes.  Apparently 
there is a report from a physical therapist at this rehab center describing Dr. Labennette falling asleep during acupressure sessions.  There is attenuation of pinprick over the right medial aspect of the hand and medial two digits, sparing the latera l aspect of the fourth finger.  There is also 
some attenuation over the thumbs and thenar regions bilaterally.  Motor is physiologic.  Reflexes are symmetric in the upper and lower extremities.   Tinel’s remains positive bilaterally as is Phalen’s.  Cervical spine ROM remains antalgic and unchanged from initial evaluation.  Lumbar spine ROM is grossly physiologic with pain at extremes of extension and some pain with quadrant loading today on the right only.  Shoulder exam is unchanged.  He has some tenderness and trigger point activity in the right medial parascapular region and the suboccipital cervical paraspinal region on the right.  He reviews radi ological reports including the cervical spine MRI. 
 The assessment is:  history, complaints, and findings consistent with cervical disc injury with radiculitis with EMG/NCV notable for multiple peripheral neuropathies in the bilateral upper extremities.  He also diagnoses cervical facet dysfunction, as well as lumbosacral facet dysfunction, bilateral compressive neuropathies in the upper extremities, and sleep apnea syndrome.  He is going to have epidural steroid in jections in the cervical spine.  He’s also going 
to be scheduled for a sleep apnea study.   
 
He conjectures that Dr. Labennette  is a candidate  for spinal injection (epidural steroid injection

 and/or facet blocks).  Also potentially sympathetic plexus blocks concurrent with therapeutic 
exercise.  Also manipulative therapy and general conditioning in physical therapy with pool therapy and pain stress management using biofeedback.  A surgical solution cannot be excluded at this point. It’s expected that his symptoms will persist and he will have chronic pain.  His ultimate functional capacity is, he believes, a bit unstable at this point.   
 
There is a deposition of Joye Labennette dated 04-28-1999.  She is not currently employed outside the home and is living in Corpus Christi, TX.   She was working part-time for her husband at the time of the injury.  She’s asked what she observed about her husband that might have prevented him from working as a chiropractor .  She said that he had difficulty walking or 
ambulating around  the house.  He was very restless at night and wasn’t sleeping.  He was limping.  This occurs when his lower back is bothering him. She observed him dropping things.  He’s not able to hold onto things for long periods of time. He’s very irritable and probably depressed. The chiropractor who was brought in as an associate was Dr. Marian McConnaghey and was given first right of refusal but she abandoned the practice.  She was not originally brought in to buy the practice. She describes how this injury has affected her tremendously; personally, economically; she doesn’t have a job now.  It’s affected her personal life.  It’s very difficult to live with someone who is in pain most of the time.  Intimacy is very limited.  She can’t get a job because her husband teaches school and goes to therapy and that’s about all he can handle.  She does the rest. She also home schools her eight year old daughter. This home schooling is largely the result of the daughter’s severe allergies and the Corpus Christi school system’s inability to accommodate. She also mentions that she has to cut the grass. She says he can’t push a mower, he can’t bend over and pull weeds or plant bushes or things of that nature.  She recalls a bicycle trip with her daughter a year earlier and that her husband had problems for four or five days after that from being on the bi cycle.  He doesn’t play golf and he doesn’t play 
tennis.  They don’t go to the beach.  She also states that she has to take out the garbage with her daughter, the husband can’t do it. She also discusses trying to get pregnant and at a fertility clinic she was told that their current frequency was not accommodating for her to get pregnant.  There was also a comment about warm weather.  Texas or California.  He had trouble after the accident in the winter because of the cold and dampness.  That was part of the reason for going to Texas. He had to file bankruptcy because he couldn’t pay bills.  This was in January 1997.  
 
There is a deposition of Jennifer M. Weiss dated 04-28-1999.  Examination by Mr. Feiner.  She also is known as Jennifer Marie Hawk.  She was driving a 1993 Chevy Cavalier.  She was on her way to be treated for carpal tunnel syndrome which was the result of a repetitive strain while working for Martin Guitar.  This is a work comp case.  However, it did not affect her driving. She describes the crash on Page 12-13.  She did not see a blinker and by the time she realized his brakes were on it was too late.  The speed limit was 55 and she was apparently traveling at about that rate of speed.  She did not have a chance to hit her brakes. She does not recall any details concerning placement in lanes after the crash or relative distances before or after the crash. She spoke to him but does not recall what he said and does not recall any further conversation. She

 estimates the repair cost to her vehicle at about $5,000. Her only injuries were bruises. Her car 
was nor drivable from the scene and she was not transported to the hospital.  She was not cited by the police although they were on the scene. Apparently she was on a downhill section of road.  
 
There is a deposition of Dr. Jeffrey Labennette dated 05-15-1999.  He moved to Corpus Christi, 
TX, in April 1996. The reason he moved to Texas was because they had a vocational and rehabilitation program for career opportunity in education to be certified as a teacher. Then he got a teaching certificate in Corpus Christi, TX, which took one year and nine months. He’s now 
teaching high school full-time. He did not sell his chiropractic business when he moved to Texas. He does not have any limitations as a teacher. He describes the physical requirements of his job as a chiropractor on Page 25.  Sounds like the typical diversified form of practice.  This was Monday through Friday and a half day Saturday. He was treating 30-40 patients a day. So typical hands-on approach was 50-60% of the time..  This includes palpation, etc.  At the time of the MVC he was running two offices. At the time of the MVC he was not employing any other chiropractors. He did, however, in 1992 and 1994. Appa rently his wife was in there as well. He 
was treated by Dr. Mark Chapman for Crohn’s disease. This has not been active since February 1990. Page 55   He’s asked about his injuries.  He responds that he’s had injuries to his neck, right and left hands and arms, shoulders, mid back, and lower back.  Any other injuries question, “I can’t think of any.”  He’s also claiming psychological injuries.  He saw Philip Gasquione, 
PhD. He was also told that he needed to see somebody for his memory loss and confusion. Also a Dr. Mahon.  He has not seen any other psychologi sts or psychiatrists. He has no other MVCs.  
No work related injuries.  He says he has had no history of neck problems.  Same for the right or left hand. He now has numbness and tingling in both hands, most notably on the right hand because it’s constant.  He has weakness and inability to grasp or hang on to or hold objects such as pens and pencils or eating utensils. Neck is very painful.  He’s unable to move his head and neck or shoulder in wide movements. He indicates that his posture has changed. He has a tremendous amount of straining and spasm that is constant at the level of his shoulders and lower in his mid back.  He has almost constant headaches and muscle spasms in his neck.  Intermittently, but quite active right now, he’s having a lot of lower back pain on the left side radiating into his left heel. He also claims to be short of breath and feels it may be related to a weight gain.  He was 6' tall and weighed 185 pounds at the time of the MVC and now weighs 227 pounds.  He denies any history of low back pai n.  He also has blurred vision at times and his 
corrective eye sight for reading has changed dramatically since the accident. He describes the accident on Page 65-66.  This was a 1993 Acura Legend.  After the crash he was somewhat wedged between the two front seats regarding his shoulders and upper torso and head.  He does not recall if his head was turned at the moment of impact. Page 68   He felt that he was pushed up in his seat.  He said that he did have his foot on the brake. And he was stopped.  He’s asked 
whether he recalls if his foot came off the brake or whether it may have gone over to the accelerator and answers that he does not recall. He’s estimating that his car would have moved 
forward about 200 feet.  He’s asked about that and says that he is now being more analytical and, 
on previous pages, has estimated this based on the position that he ended up but does not recall 
Jeffrey Labennette, DC 
Page 15 of 28 
March 7, 2000  
 
 whether he may have rolled out to some degree as well.  He does not think he was knocked 
unconscious.  He thinks he hit his head on the sunroof because he had tremendous pain on the top of his head as if someone had punched him. Back of his head struck either the headrest or sides of the headrest.  He’s asked about his hands.  There were at ten and two on the steering wheel but does not recall striking his hands at all. He apparently has intermittent memories (PTA) because he next remembers a woman tapping on the windshield, then she helped him out, then he remembers sitting on a grassy area near a driveway. He had tremendous burning and numbness in his upper extremities in his hands. He’s asked about repair bills and does not know.  Both the headlight and turn signal assemblies were broken and he thinks the bumper was off the car and both right and left fenders were dama ged. He recalls having low back pain at the 
hospital.  The next day he had a lot of pain in his neck and mid back, his right hand little finger, ring finger and up through the inside of his right arm was all numb.  In the left hand he had numbness and tingling but the pain didn’t radiate up as  far into his left arm.  Maybe to the elbow. 
He sought treatment the next day with Dr. Donald Hattier. This was in Delaware.  On September 6th or 7th he saw Dr. Snowmaker. He had not known Dr. Snowmaker before the accident.  While 
he was in Texas he apparently hired an associate to run his practice and the doctor abandoned the practice.  That was in July 1996.  So it was apparently February or March 1996 that he decided to go to Texas. He still occasionally has nightmares, dreams, and flashbacks related to the accident. Then on 12-06-95 he was seen by a Dr. Toshniwal . This was for SEPs.  He is asked about Dr. Mahon’s suggestion that he get a psychiatric evaluation but does not recall that it was something that Dr. Mahon wanted him to do. Based on the degree of confusion reported by Dr. Mahon at the time, this is not surprising. There is a comment that on 02-06-96 Dr. Snowmaker had a discussion with Dr. Mahon concerning Dr. Labennette’s erratic behavior.  Dr. Mahon was 
very upset over missed treatments and numerous other minor points. During his treatment time with Dr. Snowmaker he was also treated in his own clinic by Dr. William Shaw. This would have been from about September 26 to Oc tober 26, 1995. Possibly through 02-02-96. Also there 
was another doctor in his office who treated him occasionally.  He said they were doing primarily soft tissue: not osseous manipulation. He does not believe he was paid but the bills were submitted. Then he was seen by Dr. Terry Patterson on or before July 1996 and then with a Dr. Atkinson on April 22, 1996. He is continuing to see Dr. Patterson who is overseeing all of his care at this point. He was treated at Gulf  Coast Rehab from December 16, 1996 to September 
15, 1998. On 08-25-98 he was seen by Dr. Bruce McFarland. Also from September through 
December 1996 he treated with a chiropractor named Spearing. There was also another doctor named Duffy in Orlando. This was from 11-27-95 to  12-02-95.  He was a chiropractor.  This was 
during a vacation.  There was also a doctor named Scott Dinkins, DC.  He describes why he is unable to continue with chiropractic. He says that he doesn’t have the ability to do the thrusting maneuvers and the tactile and motion sensibilities plus the power and the mechanics of the adjustment.  This is due to a combination mostly of his neck and his back.  He’s also extremely fatigued. He also doesn’t get rest and he has sleeplessn ess. He stated that he did try to get back to 
the office in an overseeing position but the level of fatigue and pain was overwhelming and he wasn’t able to do it. He has not been recommended for carpal tunnel release surgery by any 
Jeffrey Labennette, DC

 physicians at this point. He feels that his problem is largely connected with his neck and that is 
why he is not considering carpal tunnel release surgery.  Before the MVC he could swim, play tennis, bicycle, play golf, play ball with the kids, football, softball, volleyball, etc.  He had previously coached softball.  He also had worked with the Boy Scouts of America and was a camping leader when his son was still at home. He comments that he has difficulty turning his body and bending or to play at any time, but it doesn’t bother him at the time only the following day he’s locked up. He has not attempted to play tennis and states that he cannot even grasp a racquet. He is only able to sit for about 20 minutes to one-half hour. He also said that he’s not able to participate in preparation of meals and helping his wife clean the house.  He has not been able to help his wife around the house with chores. He says he cannot do yard work, he cannot get down to plant flowers, he can’t move tools or grasp tools or do any of that type of work.  His 
wife now does 90% of it.  He can move a bag for lawn clippings and move empty garbage cans.  His wife cuts the grass. He helps dry dishes at counter level.  He also has difficulty with grocery shopping. He also complains of a loss of intimacy with his wife.  He stated that they were planning to have another child. He’s asked if he’s able to bend and squat relative to his low back and states that he cannot squat.  
 
On 06-01-1999 we have a video tape review by Pe ter Feinstein. MD.  Dr. Feinstein reviews the 
surveillance video tapes and comments that the activities displayed on the video tapes were inconsistent with Dr. Labennette’s  complaints and history as voiced to him (Feinstein).  He notes, “this segment of tape is more dramatic than that seen earlier in terms of the activities being demonstrated being absolutely and completely impossible if, in fact, Mr. Labennette’s [sic] history of symptomatology was accurate.  It would be impossible for this individual to do the activities seen on this tape in that context.”  (Describing 09-12-98 lawn mowing on video tape.)   
 
On 6-01-1999 we have an IME report from Dr. Feinstein.  He has reviewed extensive medical records in addition to a 43 page “Medical Record Summary of Jeffrey Labennette” revised 05-03-99.   In reviewing the history of injury it is noted that his car weighed approximately 4200 pounds and was moved 100 feet at impact.  He re views EMG/NCV studies.  In addition to CTS 
he describes ulnar nerve compression at the wrist at the “canal of Guyon”.  He comments that the NCV/EMG dated 03-19-99 shows essentially identical  findings to prior tests which, he suggests, 
indicates that there has been no progressive ne urological lesion on a “objective basis” and is 
negative for any traumatic type findings in terms of brachial plexus injury, thoracic outlet stretch or contusion, and/or any cervical radiculopathy.  “The objective in terms of the MRI scans indicate that there was never a herniated disc in either the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine by x-ray in terms of any traumatic changes.  There is evidence of extensive long-standing degenerative changes in all those areas.”  He also reviews peer reviews by Dr. Cavallo and Dr. Roth (both chiropractors).  Both conclude that treatment with Dr. Snowmaker was inappropriate.  (This somewhat misstates Dr. Cavallo’s report.)  Apparently Dr. Roth suggested a maximum six month time frame which would have ended in Fe bruary 1996.  Dr. Labennette has indicated that 
he has difficulty lifting using his right arm and hand, driving and walking.  He also is restricted 
Jeffrey Labennette, DC 
Page 17 of 28 
March 7, 2000  
 
 from lifting or pushing over 25 pounds and prolonge d sitting or standing positions.  This is 
reported to be in direct contradiction and “ina ppropriate and untruthful as demonstrated given 
evidence of activities in functional level described elsewhere in association with this report”.  
Dr. Feinstein also reports that the pain drawing that Dr. Labennette has completed is inconsistent with radiculopathy and would also be inconsistent with the activity level demonstrated in the information available and described elsewhere accompanying this report.  (Apparently referring to the video surveillance.) Currently he is complaining of headaches, right shoulder, arm, neck and right hand pain.  He has some numbness in his left arm.  His lumbar spine and back are better but he still has trouble with his left lower back region.  He takes Ibuprofen and has his own ultrasound and TENS unit and does traction at home.  He’s getting physical therapy twice a week and is currently not being treated by a chiropractor.  He can sit 15-20 minutes at a time and stand about one-half hour.  He can walk about one-qua rter mile.  He’s able to drive at least one 
hour without stopping.  He indicated that his wife  and daughter do the yard work, his wife mows 
the lawn and does grocery shopping.  He does no lifting or carrying.  He also complained about periods of confusion and memory loss.  Dr. Feinstein reviews MRI scans dated 09-07-95 and comments about multiple level degenerative disc disease involving C2-3, C5-6, and C6-7.  There 
are also lesions at C4-5.  There is no evidence of discrete traumatic lesion or herniated disc.  These findings, he noted, are extensive, diffuse  in nature, are long-standing, and cannot in 
anyway possibly be related to the automobile accident in question.  There is also an MRI of the lumbosacral spine dated similarly.  It also shows diffuse degenerative disc disease from T1-L5/S1. There is some sub-ligamentous bulging of the discs but no evidence of any herniation.  There is a mild scoliosis.  There is a very mild anterior listhesis of L4 and L5.  He says he would not characterize this as spondylolisthesis nor would he characterize it as any displacement, or every Grade I.  It is related to degenerative narrowing of the disc.  He also reviews a follow-up C-spine MRI dated 06-26-97 with findings essentially identical to those on the prior MRI scan and with only changes being consistent with the normal aging process in the expected progression of degenerative condition.  Follow-up MRIs of 07-06-98 of the cervical spine show 
continued progression of the extensive, diffuse, and severe degenerative disc changes.  There is no effacement or evidence of nerve root cut off, although there is some degenerative asymmetry of the discs.  He says there are further degenerative progressive changes, particularly at the C2-3 and C5-6 and C6-7 levels.  Once again he states, “these changes would be impossible from trauma and are related to the natural progression of the degenerative process.  There is no isolated traumatic lesion.”  Mr. Labennette weighs 225 pounds and is 6' tall.  Cervical spine reveals normal ROM on flexion, extension, and lateral rotation.  These are not measured in degrees and there is apparently no notation about lateral flexion.  There is some right paravertebral and trapezius discomfort on direct palpation.  Longitudinal compression was not tested.  There is some limitation of “forward flexion abduction of the right shoulder” to 130 degrees while on the left it was 170.  He complained of muscular pain during this maneuver.  There was discomfort with the impingement side bilaterally in terms of forward flexion abduction and external rotation.  He found sensory changes in the right fourth and fifth fingers 
and right medial forearm.  He had a positive Tinel’s sign on the right wrist for median and ulnar

 nerves.  Motor power was intact throughout.  There was no atrophy.  DTRs were 2+ and equal.  
This was upper extremities.  Pinch and grip strength was intact in both hands.  No evidence of tendinitis.  SLR was equivocal or questionably positive on the left at 90 degrees.  Sensory examination was normal in the lower extremities.  There was a suggestion of slight decreased sensation on the lateral aspect of the left foot.  Motor power was intact in the lower extremities.  DTRs were 2+ and equal.  There was no atrophy.  There was some left lumbosacral paravertebral discomfort.  There was some right thoracic pa ravertebral discomfort.  There was no buttocks 
discomfort, either right or left.  “This distribu tion would be inconsistent with appropriate human 
anatomy as well.”  Forward flexion ROM of the thoracolumbar spine was approximately 60-70 degrees with some mild thoracolumbar scoliosis, but no associated involuntary muscle spasm on an objective basis. He concludes that there may have been a myofascial or whiplash type of injury to the neck and lumbar spine.  Dr. Labennette has made a full and complete recovery based on the findings and surveillance video.  He has returned to normal activities, both functional and otherwise.  He currently has no restrictions whatsoever related to the automobile accident in question and can return to his pre-accident job activities of being a chiropractor. Additional unrelated diagnoses include: extensive progressive, diffuse, degenerative disc disease 
involving essentially all areas of the spinal column, including the cervical and lumbar, with less significant degree in the thoracic area.  These findings are non-traumatic in nature.  Dr. Feinstein sees no indication for any active treatment regarding his spinal degenerative disc disease, independent of whether there is any causal relationship of that degenerative disease to the automobile accident in question.  He also diagnosed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and ulnar nerve irritation at the cubital tunnel of the elbow as documented objectively by NCV and EMG.  These findings are incidental and have remained stable over the entire three to four year time frame.  He opines that NCV/EMG tests would have demonstrated similar findings prior to the MVC if available.  “Were they to be traumatic from the nature of the automobile accident in question, I would have expected to see bilateral di stal radius or Colles fractures, which would be 
the traumatic nature to obtain this type of problem.”  He further opines that the more likely basis for the CTS would be repetitive action/repetitive chiropractic manipulation activities.  He agrees with Drs. Cavallo and Roth that any use of mechanical modalities, including chiropractic care or physical therapy, were not indicated after three months to a maximum of a six month time frame.  “However, the duplication of services in Dr. Labennette’s own office regarding chiropractic treatment was truly inappropriate and unreasonable.”  He states that if Dr. Labennette were his 
patient he would not have referred him for chiropractic treatment after the three month time frame (and he does sometimes refer patients to chiropractors). There are also independent medical evaluation questionnaire forms which were filled out by Dr. Labennette in this package.  There is a note that he has worked at the duties of a chiropractor for 15 years.  There is also a pain diagram which shows aching over the right neck from the occiput down to the spine of the scapula.  There is burning sensation in that region and extending down the medial right arm into the hand.  There is also some aching over the proximal medial and posterior right forearm.  There is also aching in the left lumbar region and posterior thigh along with burning in the posterior thigh and posterior calf on the left side.  There is aching and burning in the left upper

 extremity from just below the elbow into the hand.  The anterior diagram indicates aching and 
burning with some pins and needles sensation (which are also present in the right forearm and hand posteriorly) in the medial right forearm a nd hand.  There is also some aching and burning 
sensation in that region. There is also some aching in the right upper cervical spine anteriorly and burning radiating down across the right upper trapezius into the right deltoid region.  On a 0-10 scale the neck and low back pain are rated at 8 and 8, respectively.  During the past month it is said to have averaged 8 and 5.  The highest level it has been in the past month is listed as 10 and 8, and during the past month the lowest it has been is 8 and 4, respectively.  (This severity scale does not appear to have been mentioned in the IME report.)  Aggravating factors are listed as standing, sitting long periods, movement if sudden, weather changes, sleeplessness,  and fatigue.  Palliative factors include rest, periods of walking, sitting, icepacks, use of TENS, and 
traction unit.   
 
There is also a report from Gary A. Teribla,  D.C., F.A.C.O, dated 12-13-99.  He reviews the 
history of injury.  There is also comment that  Dr. Labennette did hire other chiropractors to 
operate his practice for a short time.  Dr. Labennette underwent “frequent, extensive, and prolonged treatment with Dr. Snowmaker.  Concu rrently, he was also being treated at his own 
clinic on a frequent and regular basis.”  He was referred to John Mahon, MD., by Dr. Snowmaker, and initially seen on 11-16-95.  There is a comment about nightmares, dreams, and flashbacks related to the scene.  He was depressed, irritable and had severe insomnia.  There is also a comment of impotence which may have been due to pain and emotional stress.  Dr. Mahon found weakness of grip but was not objectively measured.  Lower extremities were weak in all muscles tested.  Dr. Mahon diagnosed concussion with subsequent  post-traumatic syndrome, post-traumatic stress syndrome, flexion/extension injury to the neck, lumbar strain, headaches, traumatic neuropathy involving both ulnar and medi an nerves, possible contusion of the spinal 
cord, insomnia, and depression.  Various studies were ordered and a brain MRI was essentially unremarkable (not exactly).  EMG performed on 01-31-96 revealed the study compatible with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and strongly suggestive of involvement of the ulnar nerves at the wrist as well.  There was a mild degree of slowing across the elbow segment of the right ulnar nerve.  An EEG on 12-07-95 was normal waking and sleeping.  He was prescribed Tegretol and Amitriptyline.  Dr. Teribla describes a comment in Dr. Mahon’s notes of 11-22-95 where he (Mahon) suggested seeing a psychiatrist  but Dr. Labennette did not want to go.  The 
patient was seen by Pradip Toshniwal, M.D.  (neurologist), on 12-06-95.  His neurological 
evaluation showed decreased touch and pin sensation involving the left arm and leg.  There was no muscle atrophy, weakness, reflex asymmetry, or other long track signs to help to find the nature of these symptoms.  He did SEP of the bilateral upper extremities which revealed normal median somatosensory evoked responses.  Dr. Labennette was also seen by Terry Hyman-Patterson, M.D., and Kim Atkinson, DO., at Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Hospital, where he received various tests, medications, and extensive physical therapy.  In August 1996, while in Texas, he was treated by Scott Dinkens, DC.  Noting the apparent progression of degenerative changes between the various MRI studies, Dr. Te ribla quotes Peter Feinstein, MD, in his 06-01-
Jeffrey Labennette, DC 
Page 20 of 28 
March 7, 2000  
 
 99 report as saying, “these changes would be impossible from trauma and are related to the 
normal progression of the degenerative process”.  Terry Peterson, MD, in 1998, diagnosed brachial plexus stretch injury and thoracic outlet syndrome.  Brachial plexus injury was also noted by Kleopa, MD (neurology resident).  This was not confirmed objectively.  There was also a records review performed by Mark Cavall o, DC, on 04-10-96.  His opinion was that Dr. 
Snowmaker’s treatment was reasonable through 01-12-96, but that any treatment subsequent to that date was not supported for medical necessity.  Regarding the question of disability, Dr. Labennette alleges that he is incapable of performing his duties as a chiropractor because of decreased tactile sensibilities, upper extremity weakness, and persistent neck, upper back, and lower back pain.  He further alleges that he cannot  sit or stand for periods of more than one-half 
hour, that he cannot bend or lift at all, and that he has extreme fatigue.  He said that he does not have the capacity to perform the techniques and methods of treatment that he was accustomed to providing.  He’s not able to open and close his right hand with any strength or grip or with grasp [sic].  He notes that even mild physical therapy activity such as using a Theraband or other mild type of exercise programs exacerbate his symptoms.  Dr. Teribla describes the surveillance tapes showing Dr. Labennette working in the garage, bending at the waist unsupported, kneeling on one leg, manipulating things, washing a glass tank, being in a prolonged bent position extending his arms and body in an unsupported fashion, and appeared to be doing these things with ease.  He was loading and unloading a van, lifting large boxes, and was seen taking out the trash and putting bags in the trash can (not empty trash cans).  He was mowing the lawn.  It appeared to be a self-propelled lawn mower with a grass catcher attachment.  He was also seen driving his van.  On another date he was edging his front lawn with  a large electric edger.  On another date (May 
1999) he was seen repairing and replacing his garage door.  He was lifting repeatedly 2 inch wide by 10-12 foot long panels.  He was using various tools with fine hand manipulation.  On a later date he was seen walking his dog, bending and lifting the dog easily, taking out the trash, and lifting a large box.  He was also seen doing yard work.  Dr. Teribla concludes that Dr. 
Labennette sustained at least myofascial type injuries of his neck and lower back as a result of the MVC.  Also that it is possible he could have sustained contusions of some of the peripheral nerves of his upper extremities.  He cannot determine whether any of these symptoms were pre-existing.  However, the EMG study performed shortly after the MVC suggests distal peripheral neuropathies of the upper extremities of a chronic long-standing nature and must have been present prior to the MVC.  Dr. Teribla states  that the findings on MRI do not explain his upper 
and lower extremity complaints.  Regarding the TOS and brachial plexus injuries, Dr. Teribla finds no evidence for this based on the records.  “Injuries of this nature generally heal with time and appropriate treatment.”  Dr. Teribla also notes that some studies have indicated that 15-40% of patients involved in such accidents will have remaining prolonged symptomatology.  A moderate improvement in both symptoms and functional capacity is seen in almost all cases, he says.  This is followed by a comment that Dr. Labennette denies any significant improvement in symptoms and functional status from the date of injury to the present time and there is no objective explanation for this.  Dr. Teribla provi des the opinion that Dr. Labennette appears fully 
capable of performing any and all activities that he  alleges that he is incapable of performing.  
Jeffrey Labennette, DC

 He concurs with Dr. Feinstein regarding Dr. Labe nnette’s untruthfulness, lack of voracity [sic], 
invalid illness behavior, and would directly call into question any and all of Dr. Labennette’s 
current complaints, alleged recreational limitations and inability to perform his regular activities as a chiropractor.  He believes that Dr. Labenne tte can perform chiropractic procedures including 
adjustment/manipulation, case histories, physical examinations, and consultations.  He can also perform PT.  He also comments that chiropractors are fortunate that they do not have to stand, sit, or bend for prolonged periods and that sp ecial techniques can be utilized.  This would 
eliminate most forms of body strain.  Therefore, “fatigue, strain, and overload on any one particular part of the body is virtually nonexistent” .  He also concludes that there is no objective 
evidence in the records to support prolonged disability beyond a three month period and that Dr. Labennette is capable of safely and effectively operating a full-time chiropractic practice.  
 
On 01-11-2000 there is a report to Attorney Feiner from Dr. Terry Hyman-Patterson.  She starts by reminding him that she follows Dr. Labennette for “post-traumatic cervical and lumbar radiculopathies with brachial plexopathy”.  He continues to suffer with cervical and lumbar spasm and back pain with any effort, burning dysesthesia, more so into the right than the left arm, and back pain that radiates into his left heel.  Examination has also shown persistent weakness of his intrinsic hand muscles, worse on the right, patchy loss of sensation, more so on the right than the left upper extremity, and decreased ROM in his neck and back.  He also has positive Allison’s maneuver at times.  He has antalgic posturing, and stiffness in his upper back and trunk.  She has also viewed the video surveillance tapes.  These tapes included five separate video tapes.  The interval of the tapes span from August 14, 1998 through May 1999.  He’s seen bending, kneeling, lifting, and mowing the lawn.  He’s also seen driving the car.  She notes some stiffness in his movements evident on these tapes.  She also notes that there were no follow-up interviews or examinations on which to determine how much pain or discomfort these activities caused.  She notes that, given his spinal disease, she doubts this activity could be sustained on a daily basis throughout the course of the entire time between filming.  Also there is no information about medication used.  Also no info rmation about how much the materials weighed 
that he was lifting.  She also notes that it seemed that in some instances, such as mowing the lawn, the time elapsed was far greater than it would take a normal person.  And, a review of physical therapy notes does indicate muscle spasm during several visits during the five intervals when the activity took place.  She thinks he has cervical and lumbar radiculopathy and symptoms of brachial plexus traction injury.  While he is capable of sedentary work, he would be unable to do the job required of a chiropractor.   
 
 
Overall Impressions 
 
Dr. Labennette experienced a very high speed rear impact motor vehicle crash exposure which likely resulted in a velocity change of 20-35 mph for his vehicle. It is noteworthy that severe spinal cord injuries occur in this range, particularly when the occupant’s seat breaks and he is 
Jeffrey Labennette, DC 
Page 22 of 28 
March 7, 2000  
 
 ejected into the rear seat. In Dr. Labennette’s case, since the seat did not break, all of the energy 
was distributed to his head and neck, as well as his lower back. Other known risk factors contributing to his injury and poor outcome include the rear vector of impact, the use of seat belts and shoulder harness, pre-existing degenerative changes in his spine, non-awareness of the impending crash, his age, immediate onset of symptoms, multiple body part injury, and initial neurological findings and loss of range of motion in the neck. An additional likely factor would be poor head restraint geometry. I have not observed this in this case, of course, but based on his height (6 ft) it is unlikely that the head restraint would be optimal for him under crash conditions. 
 
These injuries resulted in disc trauma and trauma to the ligamentous structures in the cervical spine. Moreover, it is clear from reviewing these records that Dr. Labennette sustained a cerebral concussion and later developed a rather severe and classical PCS and probable PTSD. This type 
of injury is quite consistent with this mech anism of injury and the ongoing medical records.  
 
It is also clear that Dr. Labennette has bilateral CTS and some degree of peripheral ulnar nerve neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathies are common following MVC, particularly the more severe type of rear impact. These lesions are clearly de fined with electrodiagnostic tests as noted above 
and correlate with Dr. Labennette’s chief complaints and the physical findings on examination reported by the many neurologists and other physicians who examined him. He denies any prior condition of this kind and does not have any known risk factors for CTS, nor are there any prior 
medical records attesting to such a condition. Radiculopathy in the lumbar area is also likely based on repeated clinical findings of positive sciatic stretch tests, sensory findings, and his complaints of pain in the lower extremity. Brachial plexus stretch injury and or nerve root contusions are likely also contributing to his clinical picture and would be entirely consistent with the history of injury given. 
 
 
Prognosis and Future Medical Care 
 
In my opinion, the definitive diagnostic study for looking at the cervical spine joint mechanics has not been obtained. That would be a videofluoroscopy motion study.  However, based on the mechanism of injury, duration of complaints, and rather exhaustive medical records reviewed, as well as a thorough consideration of the whiplash outcome literature, Dr. Labennette can expect only marginal further improvement in his spinal conditions, including the low back.  
 
In general, if PCS does not resolve within six months, it can be considered permanent, although patients gradually learn to at least partially adapt to their condition. Notably, insomnia is one of the common manifestations of the PCS and it appears to be a prominent component of this case. Changes in IQ, problems with manipulating numbers, occasional confusional states, phonophobia, and photophobia tend not to resolve beyond six months. I am surprised that the neuropsychologist did not make this diagnosis, since he mentioned many of the classical signs 
Jeffrey Labennette, DC 
Page 23 of 28

 and symptoms. He seems to have focused on cognitive deficits. 
 
Dr. Labennette may eventually require carpal tunnel release surgery. He commented during his 
deposition that he believes the cervical spine is contributing to the CTS symptoms (via the double crush mechanism). This was offered as a reason for avoiding surgery and is plausible. However, it is also clear that he will not likely make any further progress with treatment directed 
to the neck, although it is likely to be palliative to the point that it allow him to continue to function as a teacher. Thus carpal tunnel surgery may offer some benefit. Unfortunately, when symptoms are either severe or prolonged, as in this case, carpal tunnel release surgery is not generally able to restore all sensation. This would inevitable leave some sensory deficits and continue to impose a barrier to Dr. Labennette’s ability to practice chiropractic as a result of the loss of fine palpatory sensibility (touch). 
 
 
Disability 
 
The two factors which limit Dr. Labennette from returning to his usual duties as a treating chiropractic physician are his neck and back pain and the sensory deficits in his hands. These conditions preclude repeated bending at the waist and stooping because both impose a very high biomechanical force on the lumbar spine and the neck. Such motions are likely to be tolerable on an occasional basis throughout the day, but chiropractic practice requires such activity virtually all day long in the service of 30 to 40 patients using the techniques used by Dr. Labennette. Dr. Teribla’s comments in this regard are entirely false. 
 
Moreover, Dr. Labennette is precluded from examining these patients adequately due to his loss of palpatory and tactile sensitivity. The very essence of chiropractic is dependent upon this skill which chiropractic physicians develop over four year s of intensive training and years of practice. 
Without the ability to diagnose the spinal lesion by feeling subtle changes in joint spring and underlying muscle tone and tension (among other sensory signals such as temperature), the chiropractor has no way of knowing how to manipul ate the patient—even if his spinal condition 
would allow that. 
 
In summary, Dr. Labennette is, in my opinion, permanently, fully disabled from performing the substantial duties required in the practice of chiropractic. 
 
 
Discussion 
 
I have summarized many of the medical records that I reviewed. Others were omitted in the interest of brevity and because they were largely redundant and/or consistent with the records mentioned. Three that stand out are the deposition and report of Dr. Feinstein and the report of 
Jeffrey Labennette, DC 
Page 24 of 28 
March 7, 2000  
 
 Dr. Teribla. These deserve some special comment. 
 
Dr. Teribla’s review was reportedly comprehensiv e. If so, he provided a rather misleading and 
unbalanced analysis of the case. He noted that Dr. Mahon did not objectively report the loss of 
grip strength but failed to mention the objective reports of grip strength by other providers. He 
also quotes Dr. Feinstein’s comments regarding the “impossibility” that any MRI findings could be related to trauma. Certainly as an orthopaedist himself, Dr. Teribla does not believe in such impossibilities. He also mentions the opinion of Dr. Cavallo, who performed a file review and concluded through some unknown process of deduction that Dr. Labennette’s treatment would have been warranted through 1-10-96 (approximately 14 weeks of care). Review of medical records reveals that Dr. Labennette continued to be fully disabled at that time and highly symptomatic. It is not clear to me what records were made available for Dr. Cavallo’s review, but his opinions are clearly not supported on any scientific, theoretical, or practice guidelines 
basis and are, frankly fatuous. Nor are Dr. Roth ’s opinions that treatment should have been 
concluded after six months. There is no scientific way of making such predictions: the only way to decide whether treatment is necessary is to analyze the individual case. Had this been done, it would have been clear that Dr. Labennette was keenly in need of ongoing care beyond that point and that that continued care afforded him some relief, albeit temporary. Without this, he likely would have become a complete invalid. 
 
Dr. Teribla reviewed the surveillance video tapes and concluded from them that Dr. Labennette was fully capable of returning to work as a chiropractor. This apparently was based on a limited number of observations of Dr. Labennette getting in to and out of his van, lifting and walking his 
small dog, bending down on one knee, light use of a hammer and another tool, lifting garage door panels of unknown weight and mass, taking out trash cans of unknown weight and mass, at least some of which were on rollers, and moving and edging his lawn. It should be pointed out that none of these activities are part of a typical chiropractic office regime. Neither can they be used as a proxy for the rather vigorous and strenuous duties and requirements of a chiropractic physician seeing 30-40 patients pre day as Dr. Labennette did prior to his injury for some 15 years.  
 
Dr. Teribla concludes that Dr. Labennette could have sustained myofascial injuries and some contusions to his peripheral nerves, but could not determine whether the latter pre-existed. He points out that the EMG study performed shortly after the injury (1-31-96) demonstrated long-
standing changes suggesting a pre-existing etiology. In truth, there is virtually no way that Dr. Teribla—or anyone—could draw such conclusions fr om these tests. Lesions of this kind require 
about 4-6 weeks to develop. In this case the lesions would have had about 20 weeks to develop to the point that electrodiagnostic tests could fi nd them. Dr. Teribla’s conclusions are completely 
unsupported here. Dr. Teribla also reviewed the records of Dr. Toshniwal who ran an SEP study of the median nerves of Dr. Labennette. These were conducted in December of 1995 and were negative, suggesting the disease had not yet progressed to the point of the diagnostic sensitivity 
Jeffrey Labennette, DC 
Page 25 of 28 
March 7, 2000  
 
 of this testing equipment. This strongly argues against any pre-existing disease and underpins 
Dr. Teribla’s logic. Moreover, I have seen no other medical records or documents that would 
support even his cautionary comment vis-à-vis the potential for re-existing peripheral nerve disease. 
 
Dr. Teribla notes that the MRI findings do not explain Dr. Labennette’s upper and lower extremity complaints. Here again I would comment that his statement is misleading and untrue. It is misleading because it suggests that without MRI confirmation we can have no faith in our diagnosis. In truth, MRI remains a technology that cannot discern many of the ligamentous and other soft tissue injuries that can be disabling in whiplash trauma. This has been documented in autopsy studies. Thus, the arrogant reliance on MRI is unjustified. Clearly, the MRIs show degenerative changes and disc bulging which effaces the thecal sac. These findings alone can produce neck and back pain. Moreover, these are static studies and do not allow us to assess the appearance of things under dynamic conditions, such as with head and neck extension. However, it is known that disk bulges such as are seen on these MRIs do result in further encroachment with extension. This diagnostic limitation should always be considered when viewing static studies. The lumbar films also could explain any and all of his symptoms.  
 
Dr. Teribla notes that these injuries “generally heal with time and appropriate treatment.” Over the past 40 years, more than 40 outcome studies have been published—most dealing with the more common variety of whiplash injury, as opposed to the more severe type seen in this case. For rear impact crashes, the mean chronicity rate is 58%. Dr. Labennette’s crash was more severe than the types seen in most of these studies. Dr. Teribla’s comment is thus grossly inaccurate. It is also pointless to make since he is being asked to address a specific person and a specific injury—that of Dr. Labennette. He is not addressing the general population of whiplash victims and the statistical binary probability of recovery and no recovery. 
 
In supporting his opinions regarding Dr. Labennette’s ability to return to work, Dr. Teribla suggests that he can perform special techniques which apparently meant that he would be able to minimize bending, stooping, and other physically stressful or awkward positions and postures. There are no such special techniques that allo w chiropractors to avoid difficult positions and 
postures. Moreover, changing a treatment style is not something that is done easily. Most practitioners would struggle greatly with this even if it did offer an alternative. He also seems to have avoided one of the most critical issues, that of the sensory deficits. It is noteworthy that he 
did not in any way have the opportunity to inte rview Dr. Labennette.  Dr. Teribla has obviously 
disregarded the opinions of neurologists, other chiropractors, and other medical physicians who have all agreed—having had direct experience w ith Dr. Labennette that Dr. Teribla did not 
have—that Dr. Labennette could not return to work as a chiropractor. And this seems to have been entirely based on the review of video tapes which bear no reasonable resemblance to chiropractic work. This assessment is superficial, careless, and completely unscientific and without any basis in good disability evaluation methodology.

Dr. Feinstein reported (6-1-99) that the EM G/NCV studies do not demonstrate any objective 
neurological progression as a basis for suggesting that they are pre-existing. However, he also 
does not support this opinion with any prior evidence of neurological symptoms or pre-existing related disability. Apparently, there is none. The records clearly indicate that Dr. Labennette does have a neurological problem—which has been objectified —and did practice chiropractic 
for some 15 years up to the time of the injury.  He notes that the pain diagram made by Dr. Labennette is inconsistent with radiculopathy and his video tapes. But they are not inconsistent with severe whiplash trauma and back injury and they are not inconsistent with bilateral CTS and ulnar neuropathy. Nor can a pain drawing be logically compared to these video tapes. 
 
I have viewed these video tapes. They show Dr. Labennette taking out trash bags which appear to be light. The trash cans he is moving are of unknown weight and mass and are on rollers, but do not appear to be heavy. He uses what appears to be a self-propelled mower. Another video tape shows him with a woman and child walking. She carries several books and another satchel. He carries nothing. He is seen using a socket wrench and hammer with only apparent light force on the wrench and light tapping with the hammer. These actions do not require the fine manual and tactile dexterity required by a chiropractor. The tapes do not depict Dr. Labennette assuming 
repeated bending or stooping postures characteristic of chiropractic treatment. Nor do they depict 
him working for anything close to eight hours straight in these positions. Between the dates of 8-14-98 and 5-22-99, these tapes depict activities in the life of Dr. Labennette occurring on approximately 16 different days which cover a pe riod of approximately nine months. Thus, out 
of a possible 270 days or so, we have information on 16 (only 6%). From the time of injury to the last video period about 1250 days has transpir ed. These videos represent only 1% of that 
period—not a very reliable method of assessment. And, as mentioned by Dr. Petterson, we know little about the discomfort that might have been caused by these activities. We also know nothing of the weighs or masses of the objects lifted, and drawing any conclusions about the ability to work as a chiropractor full time is frankly as fatuous and disingenuous as one can get.  
 
It seems that Dr. Feinstein, like Dr. Teribla, is c ontent to disregard and negate virtually the entire 
medical record based solely on the appearance of these tapes. He calls attention to the statements Dr. Labennette made concerning his inability to perform various tasks such as taking out the trash and lifting more than 25 lb and mowing the lawn. Yet, in no case can one discern whether any of the items lifted by Dr. Labennette weigh more than 25 lb. However, Dr. Labennette also notes in his deposition that his wife does 90% of th is work now. It would be logical to conclude 
that he does at least some of the remaining 10%. Might these video tapes reveal some of those occasions? Since the tapes cover only 6% of this period, there’s no way of knowing. Were any tapes made that we have not seen, perhaps revealing Ms. Labennette mowing the lawn? It seems unlikely that a firm hired to conduct such a surveillance operation would randomly conduct their work over such a long period (nine moths) and end up with only these few tapes.

 Dr. Feinstein mentions that there is no evidence of a discrete disc lesion resulting from trauma. 
This is a curious comment. In my experience, such lesions are rarely seen with this type of trauma. Most of the damage to the disc is usually structural (contusions, tearing of fibers, etc.) and poorly seen on MRI unless frank herniation has occurred. However, these MRI studies do show bulging and effacements that could explain some of Dr. Labennette’s symptoms and could also likely have resulted from the injury. Nobody can answer that question definitively. The fact that some pre-existing degenerative changes commensurate with Dr. Labennette’s age are also present does not diminish this probability as Dr. Feinstein seems to imply rather illogically. His comment that these findings are “extensive, diffuse in nature, are long-standing, and cannot in any possibility be related to the automobile accident in question,” suggests that all of the trauma in the spine can be visualized on MRI. The comment also is odd coming from someone who claims to have experience as a forensic examiner. In this business, we do not apportion pre-existing pathology (such as mild degenerative changes in the spine or spondylolisthesis). We only apportion pre-existing disability. Likewise, one does not dismiss radiographic findings as 
unimportant on the basis that they (or some of them) may have preceded the event in question. Dr. Feinstein was provided no evidence of pre-existing disability with regard to the cervical spine, the lumbar spine, cognitive problems, or peripheral neuropathy. The hospital radiologist’s comments were that these changes included “mild degenerative disc disease at C5-6.” This is a common finding in persons of this age and studies have shown no strong correlation to symptoms in the general population. However, I submit that the disc findings in this case are not as diffuse as Dr. Feinstein argues and are very likely the result of the MVC in question. Moreover, I believe they probably do explain some of his symptoms. 
 
It is also curious that while nearly all other practitioners who examined Dr. Labennette found notable, and often rather severe, limitations of  cervical spine motion, Dr. Feinstein found—for 
the first time since the injury apparently—normal range of motion. He did not report it in degrees, nor did he report lateral flexion, which is again curious given his claimed forensic background. Did he not measure this important range? One wonders whether he actually measured these ranges with a goniometer of other verifiable and scientific device (e.g., as recommended by the AMA Guidelines to the Evaluation of Impairment) vs. using the “eyeball” method. Eight weeks prior to his visit with Dr. Feinstein, Dr. McFarland reports antalgia in this area of the spine which is unchanged from his previous examination of a month earlier in which it was reported as “markedly antalgic.” Thus, based on what the records show, it is unlikely that Dr. Labennette’s cervical spine range of motion was normal during Dr. Feinstein’s examination. 
 
Dr. Feinstein argues that the EMG/NCV findings have remained stable over some period and 
that this indicates the condition was pre-existing. In truth it illustrates only that the condition has not progressed since the injury—not that it predated the injury. His comment regarding the Colles fractures and the steering wheel is uninformed. These peripheral lesions are quite common in whiplash trauma and do not require direct striking injury or fracture.

 Dr. Feinstein also mentioned that the finding that  “There was some right thoracic paravertebral 
discomfort.  There was no buttocks discomfort, either right or left.  This distribution would be 
inconsistent with appropriate human anatomy as well.” His point evades me completely here. Human anatomy, when it comes to pain patterns, is terribly unpredictable. I have seen these pain patterns in thousands of patients. Moreover, as I’m sure Dr. Feinstein is aware, these patterns change from day to day. To suggest malinge ring on this basis is fatuous in my opinion. 
 
Finally, regarding Dr. Feinstein’s comments that Dr. Labennette has made a full and complete recovery and can return to his usual work as a chiropractor are completely unfounded, illogical, and baseless. It requires that all other medical records be discounted, and Dr. Feinstein seems to have done so to a large extent from viewing the surveillance video tapes. He obviously disregarded all of Dr. Labennette’s comments to him regarding his limitations and degree of pain, and does not consider the effect of sensory deficits on the ability to practice chiropractic. This latter would indicate a lack of understanding as to what a chiropractor does prepatory to spinal manipulation. I’m sure Dr. Feinstein, as an orthopaedic surgeon, can appreciate the need for tactile discrimination. Chiropractors require that sense as well.

Dear Dr. Croft: 
 
I thought you might like to have some feedback on the train videotapes before you go to 
Northern California.  I watched them all, and like you said, used fast forward liberally.  I spent about 4.5 hours. 
 
May 24, 1999 Port of Stockton: 
 
Participants were Don Wasserman, Dr. David Wilder, and Dr. Jack Wasserman.  The start of the video was two nose-to-nose switche rs (engines), described as diesel electric. 
 
Next they moved inside the cab and videotaped a “Jagger?” seat that rotated 360 degrees.  They wiggled the seat and it had quite a bit of “slop” where it connected to the floor.  There was a lumbar support and backrest angle adjustment.  “Electric” seat pads were placed in both the engineer’s and passenger’s seats (the pads were accelerometers).  A transducer was placed behind the seat, mounted to the floor, that recorded motions in the X and Y directions.  That data would be  compared to what the seats were doing. 
 
The engineer used his left arm quite a bit to operate several levers, as he was moving back in forth in the yard.  There was a bar-type  footrest in front of the engineer about 1 
foot off the floor.  While in the yard changing cars, the engineer twisted in the seat quite a bit, rotating his torso and neck.  He leaned out the window to his right often; the armrest was well worn to prove it. 
 
May 25, 1999 Sacramento 
 
The electric pad that was duct taped to the seat cushion was described as a triaxial accelerometer.  They described their purpose as an ergonomic evaluation.  The seat was called a "toadstool" engineer's seat.  They were in the yard moving cars backward and forward and backward and forward for a 
long time.  The engineer was very lightly jostled 
almost constantly as to train rocked back and forth. 
 
They showed the engine hooking up with other cars, looking directly down at the connectors (I don't know what they're actually called).  There is quite a bit of play between the connectors, maybe a total of two inches.  There is an arm on the connector leading back under the car that appeared to have a damper that allowed approximately 8-10 inches of additional play.  Another car did not have any play in and its arm, only between the connectors. 
 
 
May 26, 1999 Roseville 
 
Another picture of the engineer's seat, which was like a captain's chair.  There was a 
lumbar support built into the chair that extended laterally, like a race car seat.  There were various seats that they videotaped and some of them had different seatback heights, the highest hitting at approximately T1 and another as low as T7 or 8.  None of the seats had any kind of headrest.  
 
November 15, 1999 Sparks to Roseville 
 
Various views of the engine car and its connector to other cars.  Views inside the cabin, especially the engineer’s and passenger’s seats.  Some of the seats on these videotapes were new and some were old.  The older chai rs did not have any lumbar support and had 
lower seatbacks. 
 
December 15-16, 1999  
 
Videotape of a caboose, inside and out.  Also the rest of the train.  A seat in the caboose showed an unidentified man seated looking straightforward, and then leaning out a window toward his left.  This seat back was very high, extending about two inches above the top of his head.  Dr. Jack Wasserman was then rigged with a triaxial accelerometer placed on top of his head while seated.  The accelerometer appeared to be held in place with and Ace Bandage wrapped around his head, going under his chin.  There was also a seat pad accelerometer in place.  The apparatus on top of his head also contained a narrow beamed light that was aimed forward into a 3X4 piece of white board.  There were two horizontal lines across the board that were made out of red tape.  There was a dot in the middle of the two tape lines that he aimed the light at.  The lines were about 5-6 inches apart and there were markings every two inches above and below the lines. 
 
As the train moved Jack attempted to shine the light at the dot.  For the most part he was able to hold a pretty good aim, (except when he fell asleep about three hours later).  There were a few instances where the caboose was jolted and the light suddenly moved up approximately 6 inches.  What seemed to be the strongest jolt caused the light to dip downward may be 8 inches. 
 
My general impression was that the forces illustrated on the videos were gentle, but there was continuous mild jostling which could have a cumulative effect.  
 
 
CHARLES L. PONSE VS. SO UTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD 
 
 
11-23-1994 This is an Urgent Care Department note from Medford Clinic.  Chief complaint is 
painful tender left side.  Onset about two or three weeks ago.  The physician’s notes 
again are very difficult to read.  There is a comment about smoking less than one 
pack per day.  Something about the right ches t.  No SOB, N/V, etc.  There is a note 
also about intermittent left hand numbne ss and awakening (?) something.  Also 
apparently a chest x-ray (AP/LAT) was ordered and found to be normal.  The 
assessment was left chest wall (?) pain.  Can’t read the second.  He is given Advil and moist heat and something else and Motrin.  There is also a note that says Tinel’s is negative bilaterally.     
09-09-1995 This is a record from the Urgent Care  Department at Medford Clinic.  Onset was 
listed as a couple of weeks ago.  The chief complaint is pain under the left ribcage 
and left flank area.  No pain or burning with urination.  The physician’s writing is 
difficult to read.  There seems to be a ques tion mark regarding what  apparently is the 
diagnosis of back strain and something else.   
09-09-1995 Radiological consultation from Medford Clin ic for a lumbar spine and thoracic spine. 
 This is signed by George Lewis, M.D.  Clin ical info included left sided pain, chronic 
tenderness, history of kidney stones.  Dege nerative spurring in the dorsal spine.   
Probably a degree of osteopenia.  Lumbar is  AP/LAT as is the thoracic spine. There 
is a mild levoconvex lumbar curvature.  S light narrowing in the L4-5 and L5-S1 disc 
space heights.  At the latter there may be minimal osteophytic spurring.   Some 
pelvic vascular calcification is noted.  Impression includes a question of very 
minimal degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, otherwise negative.  The report apparently is addressed to Dr. Robin Miller.   
09-16-1995 This is a telephone message from the Medford Clinic section of the file regarding a 
phone call from the wife saying that Mr. Ponse was doing well and will call PRN.   
02-27-1997 Referring physician is Robin Miller, M.D.  This is Southern Oregon Orthopedics for 
a comprehensive spine evaluation by Ronald  L. Henderson, M.D.  Patient is a 49 
year old male with primary complaint of right  sided neck and scapular pain.  Date of 
onset is given as July/August 1996.  He wa s doing a lot of physical activities at work. 
 At this time, he is having primarily right scapular pain.  This pain was on and off for 
the next few years (sic).  Six months a go he had extensive dental work done and 
began having pain in his neck as well as the scapula.  The pain is worse with right neck rotation and with extension.  He also complains of occasional popping in his neck.  He has treated with moist heat, soft  tissue massage, muscle relaxers, a cervical 
collar which didn’t help.  He is currently  on two weeks vacation.  Past surgical 
history includes dental implants in Ju ly 1998 and a polypectomy in January 1996.  
He is currently taking Advil and Axid.  (Note: misspelling in deposition transcript 
was Assid, I believe.)  He also has minor complaints of stomach problem, joint pain, hearing loss, and allergies.  (There is a note about allergy to sulfa drugs, no others.)  No midline spinal tenderness is noted.  He  flexes his neck chin to chest with no 
increase in pain.  Extension is to 30 degrees  limited by pain.  Right lateral flexion is 
to 15 degrees with increased pain.  Left is to 15 degrees with no increased pain..  Lateral rotation is 30 degrees to the right with increased pain, and 30 degrees to the 
 
 2left without increased pain.  Sensation to  light touch and proprioception are normal.  
DTRs are 2+ and equal bilaterally.  No pathological reflexes or clonus.  Muscle 
strength in the upper extremities is 5/5.  Pulses are normal.  Adson’s, Phalen’s, 
Tinel’s at the wrist and elbow, Spurling’s,  Lhermittes’, compression test, and traction 
and all negative.  View of x-rays shows multi-level degenerative changes, with C4-5 
level the best  (? what he m eans by best).   However, some instability is noted at that 
level.   (Sounds as though he is saying C4-5 is the least degenerated.)  (Also (?) how 
he decided instability was present with thes e static films.)  So, the assessment is 
cervical spondylosis.  He is given a prescr iption for physical therapy, instruction for 
home exercise, a trial of traction if successful.  He’ll be given some samples of both Lodine and Relafen to try.  He’ll recheck in  six to eight weeks.  If no improvement, 
MRI.   
03-05-1997 Two page report titled Evaluation/Plan of Care by Linda Stremel, P.T.  She goes over 
the history briefly.  Present complaints ar e constant aching pain in the neck rated 
4/10.  With movement he has a stabbing pa in rated 6-7/10.  He frequently awakes 
with pain when changing position.  He al so reports scapular pain which is 
intermittent since his shoulder strain in 1991.  (Seems to contradict other reports.)   
Reflexes are absent bilaterally for triceps,  biceps and brachioradi alis.  ROM (active) 
is left rotation 35 degrees, right rotation 45 degrees, extension minimally limited though difficult returning to neutral secondary to pain.  Cervical flexion is minimally 
limited though there is persistence of cervical lordosis at end range of flexion.  Side 
bending bilaterally 25 degrees.   There is audible distinct popping with axial rotation.  Strength is normal.  Increase in muscle t one of entire cervical spine, upper trapezius, 
and levator scapula region bilaterally, right wo rse than left.  This is with palpation.  
Treatment includes heat, myofascial rel ease, manual cervical traction, trial of 
mechanical traction, and possible home unit, stretching and isomet ric exercises with 
education and exercise utilizing spinal stab ilization concepts.  Aquatic exercise if 
needed to reinforce spinal stabilization concepts.   
03-25-1997 Mt. Shasta Physical Therapy and We llness Clinic.  Physician’s signature is 
Henderson/Bullaid, R.N.  The physical therap ist is listed at Linda Stremel.  Total 
eight visits.  Progress listed as good.  Ce rvical crepitus is 50% improved.  AROM 
remains moderately to severely limited.  Stressing isometric cervical strengthening 
and stability prior to working on active ROM increases.  Pain is 2/10 with episodic 
increases to 3-4/10.  Patient complains that he is not able to lay on his left side, 
primarily due to neck pain.  He is doing exercises with 5-10 pound resistance while retaining neutral lumbar and cervical spine position.   
04-04-1997 Additional Mt. Shasta Physical Ther apy and Wellness Clinic progress report.  
Signature is not legible.  Appears to be the same handwriting as that of the 03-25-97 
report, however.  Patient is said to be pr ogressing well with his gym exercises.  Has 
fairly good tolerances showing spinal stability using 5-15 pounds of resistance.  Still having difficulty with pain and crepitus w ith cervical AROM or isometrics with 25 
degrees of axial cervical rota tion to either side.  Goals listed are RTW in two months. 
 Also box lift floor to table height 50 pounds times five.   
04-07-1997 This is a follow-up visit with Ronald Henderson, M.D.  He is doing about 25% better 
 
 3after physical therapy but still does not feel that  he is capable of returning back to his 
original job.  Exam is unchanged for the most part.  He is going to get an MRI.  He is 
also going to be referred to physical medical  rehab for evaluation.  He will continue 
physical therapy.  He gets a work release fo r four weeks and will follow-up in four to 
five weeks.  Ultimately, the patient may require vocational rehab job change.   
04-21-1997 This is special test results from Rona ld L. Henderson, M.D.  He has reviewed the 
MRI scan dated 04-17-97.   There appears to be a congenital os odontoideum or 
possibly a nonunion of an odontoid fracture.  There is some mobility which is 
apparent on the films.  Multi-level cervi cal spondylosis throughout the spine but no 
frank areas of cord impingement.  Review  of February x-rays reveal marked 
degeneration at C3-4, C5-6, and C6-7.  There is slight mobility at C3-4 and C4-5 (?). 
 His forward flexion does show possibly 5mm of anterior subluxation of C1 on C2 
which would be consistent with os odontoi deum.  This is beyond the upper limits of 
normal.  Based on this new information I f eel we should proceed with a CT scan of 
the area.  This will evaluate cord impingement during flexion and extension.   
04-29-1997 Follow-up visit with Dr. Henderson.  EMGs showed no significant evidence of 
radiculopathy.  He’s also gone over the CT  scan which shows an instability due to 
the os odontoideum.  He moves 8-10mm with  flexion and extension.  This leaves 
approximately 13mm for the cord at the wors t point of flexion.  Given this instability 
he is recommending that Mr. Ponse wear a co llar whenever he’s at risk of falling or 
when driving a car.  He’s recommending that he undergo stabilization of the C1-2 inner space.  Second opinion will be coming from Dr. DeLong.  He says he has discussed vocation and does not feel that Mr. Ponse can go safely back to railroad work and will likely require retraining into a more sedentary type job.   
04-29-1997 This is a letter to Dr. Henderson from  Daniel A. Saviers, M.D., regarding EMG 
testing.  Dr Saviers is certified as a phys ical medical rehab physician.  Dr. Saviers 
apparently reviewed the CT scan and the x -rays (not clear whethe r he saw MRI).  He 
has history of a fracture of the right wrist a nd kidney stones.  No history of arthritis.  
Taken Advil and Relafen in the past.  Says  that the treatment with physical therapy 
was very helpful, especially the scapular region muscle discomfort.  He’s got about 55 degrees of flexion, 30 degrees of ex tension, 35 degrees of side bending, 50 
degrees of right rotation, and 60 degrees of left rotation in the neck.  Pain at end range extension.  Strength is 5/5 in the upper extremities.  Reflexes are 2/4 in biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, and knee jerk.  No spasticity.  Negative clonus.  Negative Hoffman’s.  Pinprick sensation is intact  in upper extremities and symmetrical.  
Shoulders have normal ROM.  Right ulnar mo tor responses were WNL.  This is at 
the elbow.  Right ulnar EP waves and ri ght median H response looked at proximal 
conduction at the C8-T1 and C1 levels, re spectively, are WNL.  EMG screening of 
selective muscles of the right upper extremity and bilateral cervical paraspinals show muscle membrane instability in the C2-3 le vel paraspinals bilaterally.  Analysis of 
voluntary motor unit potentials is WNL with full recruitment in all muscles sampled (deltoid, biceps, triceps, pronator teres, first dorsal interosseous, right upper trapezius, and also in the C5-T1 paraspinals on the right side).  His impressions were: 1) electrodiagnostic studies suggest high cer vical radiculopathy, but no evidence of 
 
 4involvement in any nerve roots going into  the brachial plexus, and no evidence of 
cervical myelopathy; 2) multi-level cervical spondylosis.   
05-07-1997 This is an initial evaluation/history fr om Dr. DeLong.  Beginning date listed at July 
1996.  Initial symptoms described as pain in the right scapular, right  trapezius and 
right rear neck area (this form apparently  filled out by Mr. Ponse as it is written in 
first person).  He’s been on and off work periodically.  Lately, about three months 
continuous.  He also complains of some poppi ng in his neck.  He also has range of 
motion in his neck.  Things that make him feel better (circled choices) included 
exercise, lying down, sitting down, hot t ub, changing positions, and stretching.  
Things that aggravate include leaning over table or sink, bending, stooping, twisting, 
standing for more than several hours, a nd driving.  Handwritten notes, apparently 
from Dr. DeLong, at the bottom of the pa ge, show shoulder injury 1991, something 
about one and one-half to tw o months.  Also, something about 02-23-97 (can’t read 
it).  He has stiffness in the morning wh en he wakes up.  He does have difficulty 
sleeping.  He says he used to sleep eight  hours a night and now sleeps six because he 
wakes up because of pain.  He is curren tly only taking Axid once or twice a month 
for heartburn.  He’s asked about current sy mptoms occurring in the past and answers 
right shoulder injury in 1991.  These sympto ms resolved.  They went away after 
three or four months.  History of MV C approximately 1967.  He was the driver, 
restrained, was broadsided.  Lists injuries as “none”.  Regular exercise consists of 
walking and physical therapy.  He smokes one pack of cigarettes  per day for 25 
years.  He drinks two glasses of beer pe r day, three cups of coffee.  What are his 
goals? (multiple choices).  Include get me b ack to work to my previous job and tell 
me what treatment is available for me and, handwritten in, evaluate my condition 
regarding surgery.  Regarding the question of possible options he would accept, he 
excludes chiropractic treatment.  His general scale of discomfort is listed as “3" on a 
0-10 scale.   
05-09-1997 Mt. Shasta Physical Therapy and Wellne ss Clinic progress report.   Not signed.  Poor 
Xerox quality, difficult to read.  Problems iden tified include restricted cervical range. 
 Cervical instability also noted.  Proposed  treatment includes DC to private pay 
wellness membership.   
05-19-1997 This is a handwritten chart note which is stamped 05-19-97, but the handwritten date 
is 06-30-97.  It states, patient saw P. We instein--is going to hold off on surgery.  
Referred him to M. A. Puzzo, M.D., in L.A. for opinion.  Signed A.W. 
05-19-1997 Letter to Ronald Henderson, M.D., fr om Dr. DeLong.  He reviews the history, 
including the 1991 shoulder injury which responded to physical therapy but kept him off work a month and one-half or two months .  He had no residuals from that.  ROM 
in C-spine is limited with extension to 50 degrees, flexion to 45 degrees, left rotation 
to 60 degrees, right rotation to 45 degr ees.  There is a disturbing popping sound, 
audible externally, as well as to the patient, especially on extension and right rotation, but present also on flexion and le ft rotation.  He states that the popping 
noise has only developed since August 1996 and was not present before that time.  He has tenderness over the upper cervical facet s bilaterally, more marked on the right 
side.  DTRs are 2+ biceps bilaterally, 1+ triceps and brachioradialis, 2+ at the knees, 
 
 51+ at the ankles.  Mr. Ponse is 165 pounds a nd 5'8" tall.  Strength is intact throughout 
and sensation to pinprick is normal.  He reviews the x-rays, MRI, and CT scan.  His 
overall diagnostic impressions are: 1) C1 -2 instability with os odontoideum and 
ligamentous instability with C1-2 subluxati on; 2) cervical spondylosis with central 
spinal stenosis at C3-4, and posterior osteophytic spurring at C5-6 and C6-7.  He poses a problem in management because of the advanced spondylosis at C3-4 
combined with the C1-2 inst ability.  He recommended to the patient that he has a C1-
2 fusion utilizing sublaminar wire fixation a nd autogenous iliac crest graft.  He feels 
that the popping sensation has indicated a progression of the instability and it would 
be unsafe for him not to undergo surgical fi xation.  He’s discussed the limitations of 
surgery including severe loss of cervical rotation with difficulty driving, hunting, fishing, and hiking.  He should not return to railroad work with or without the fusion. 
  
05-22-1997 Handwritten note on a prescription slip is a note to Dr. Philip Weinstein.  “We 
propose C1-2 posterior fusion for instabilit y.  Patient wants second opinion.  Please 
evaluate.  Copy of consult letter pending.  Thanks.”  Signed by Dr . DeLong.  (This is 
placed on top of three or four other similar notes which are obscured.)   
06-23-1997 This is the second opinion report by Philip Weinstein, M.D.  He is, apparently, a 
neurosurgeon.  There is occasional radiation of  pain into the right frontoparietal scalp 
area, and neck rotation is painful.  Examin ation reveals no focal neurological defect.  
DTRs are intact and symmetrical.  No pat hological reflexes.   Cervical spine ROM 
was mildly restricted, and there was some pa in on the right side during rotation to the 
left (no degrees of motion given).  His EMG showed no evidence of radiculopathy 
(not clear which EMG he’s referring to).  Th e MRI is reviewed.  He states that there 
is a “slight anterior subluxation of C1 with respect to C2 which does not appear to be 
more than 3-4mm.  The A/P diameter of the neural canal in the neutral position is more than adequate, and there is no evidence of stenosis at that level.”  He does note 
that flexion films were obtained last February suggesting the possibility of a 5mm anterior subluxation of C1 on C2.  He, apparently, did not see these.  He did see the CT scan.  This appears to show 3-5mm of movement during flexion.  He states that 
he believes the radiologist report overes timates the 8-9mm subluxation, perhaps on 
the basis of artifact due to the reconstruc tion technique. Yes, he did not have the 
opportunity to see the plane films.  He also notes “there is calcification and 
ossification of the transverse ligament and the apical ligaments.  These observations 
are not consistent with a high degree of in stability or hypermobility in this congenital 
lesion of the atlanto-axial joint.”  (Developmen tal lesion.)  He also states that he was 
able to get a second opinion from the ne uro radiologist, Dr. William Dillon.  His 
report will be provided under separate cover.  He feels there is a minimal degree of 
hypermobility at C1-2.  He therefore advised Mr. Ponse that it would be reasonable for him to defer surgical treatment and have a follow-up set of flexion/extension 
films done in four months to determine wh ether or not there has been progression of 
instability.  He further believes that th e present symptoms of neck pain, popping 
sensation, and limitation to the cervical sp ine mobility are due to his diffuse multi-
level degenerative spondylosis, since there is no evidence of neurological deficit due 
 
 6to radiculopathy or myelopathy.  He thinks it would be best to defer surgical of the 
C1-2 condition.  He feels there is no indica tion for surgery at the mid cervical levels. 
 He informed Mr. Ponse that he remains at a slight increase of risk of paralysis due to 
spinal cord injury, but that this risk is difficult to calculate or predict and that he 
should get along reasonably well and with an acc eptable degree of safety if he is able 
to avoid exceedingly precarious situations, such as climbing or skiing where he is 
most likely to sustain a fall with a severe head and neck injury.  He notes that Mr. 
Ponse would certainly prefer to avoid surgical treatment.   
08-14-1997 Letter to Dr. Weinstein from Dr. Dill on.  Commenting on the CT and MRI scans he 
notes that scans demonstrate some mild spo ndylitic changes, particularly at the C3-4 
level with some slight retrolisthesis at  the C3-4.  Spondylosis is present throughout 
the cervical spine, but worse at C3-4 where there is mild central thecal sac 
encroachment, mild spondylitic change at C4-5 and C5-6.  C6-7 demonstrates 
degenerative disease with minimal spondylitic changes.  There is an apparent 
discontinuity defect of the dens of th e C2 vertebral body which does demonstrate 
mild compression of thecal sac at this level.  There is no significant spinal cord compression but there is slight motion detected on flexion/extension CT studies reformatted in the sagittal plane.  While th ere is no compression of the spinal  cord, 
the MR scan suggests perhaps a slight increase signal intensity of the spinal cord.  It’s difficult to know whether this is s econdary to artifact or to compression.  
However, I believe there may be some myelomalacia changes within the upper cervical spinal cord seen best on the axial views.   
10-14-1997 Letter to Ronald Henderson, M.D., from Dr. DeLong.  Mr. Ponse has been 
reevaluated this day and also has been seen by Dr. Ken Hsu who is an orthopedic 
spine surgeon.  His symptoms have persisted and at times when he lays down his head feels so weak that he has to physically lift it up with his hands to get off the pillow.  He recently went hunting and noticed  increased pain in the neck radiating 
down into the shoulders and upper thoracic re gion (? if he fired his rifle).  Left 
rotation was only possible to 30 degrees toda y with right rotation still possible to 45 
degrees. Otherwise unchanged.  He saw Dr . Philip Weinstein, a neurosurgeon as 
UCSF, for a second opinion.  Dr. Weinstein felt there was a slight increase of risk of 
paralysis due to spinal cord injury because of the instability, that surgery could be postponed.  He sent the films for interpretation to Dr. William Dillon, one of the UCSF radiologists, who apparently stated “I believe that there may be some myelomalacia changes within the upper cervical spinal cord seen best on the axial views.”  He (DeLong) has suggested th at Dr. Dillon’s opinion of myelomalacia 
increases the indication for surgery ev en though the patient strongly felt about 
postponing the surgery.  The patient is going to go ahead with the surgery.  He was also encouraged to stop smoking prior to the surgery.   
10-14-1997 This is a report to Dr. DeL ong from Dr. Hsu.  He is having arm pain and neck pain 
with the neck pain becoming worse with movements of his neck.  His neck feels very stiff.  Flexion and extension of the cervi cal spine are 50% of normal.  Rotation and 
lateral bending are about 30% of normal.  There is an audible popping sound in his 
upper cervical spine with movements of th e neck, including extension, rotation, and 
 
 7flexion. There is significant tenderness over the upper cervical spine.  DTRs are 2+ 
in both biceps, 1+ at triceps and brachioradialis, 2+ in both knees, and 1+ in both 
ankles.  No pathological reflexes.  Sensor y and motor exams of all four extremities 
are normal.  He reviews the x-rays, MRI.  He agrees with Dr. DeLong that the C1-2 
fusion should be performed first, with any secondary surgeries done at lower levels 
at a later date.  Among his current diagnos es are C1-2 instability, spinal stenosis, 
cervical spine, degenerative disc disease, cervical spine, odontoid agenesis.  (? spinal stenosis)   Currently he can walk any distance without pain, can sit in a comfortable chair for any length of time, and can stand for any length of time but with pain.  He 
can sleep well only with medication.  Sex life is normal but with extra pain.  Social 
life is limited due to pain.  He can travel  only two hours.  Score on the Oswestry was 
34/100.   
10-14-1998 11-18-1997 Pre-operative 2-view chest series.  This is a normal chest.  Dictated by 
Robert Hart, M.D.   
11-18-1997 Pre-operative physical and history by Arthur  B. Schuller, M.D.  There is a question 
of a T-wave abnormality on his ECG, possibly related to inferior ischemia.  There is 
also a cholesterol level of 235.  He’s also apparently used inhalers occasionally in the past.  He has cut down his smoking now prior to surgery to one or two cigarettes per 
day and understands the impact of smoking on his fusion.  He apparently has an 
elaborate set of dentures which he will disc uss with the anesthesiologist.  Motion in 
the neck was restricted in all planes b ecause of pain.  (No degrees given)  No 
evidence of atrophy or weakness bilaterally in the C5-T1 distribution and in the L4-
S1 distribution.  DTRs were 2+ bilaterally at biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, knees 
and ankles.  He is medically cleared for fusion surgery with Dr. DeLong.   
11-19-1997 This is spine care operative report from St.  Mary’s Medical Center.  Surgeon #1 is 
Dr. DeLong.  Surgeon #2 is Dr. Hsu.  Assist ants are Mark Drzala, M.D., and David 
Jupina, M.D.  Pre-operative diagnosis is  odontoid separation with C1-2 subluxation 
and instability, cervical spondylosis.  That is also the post-operative diagnosis.  The patient was placed in a Halo brace, turn ed over into the prone position and the 
surgery was undertaken.  Bone was harveste d from the right iliac crest.  A Danek 
stainless steel cable was used to fix th e posterior arch of C1 around the spinous 
process of C2.  The high speed burr was us ed to denude the spinous process of C2 
and the posterior arch of C1 and can cellous bone was placed around the bleeding 
bone.   
11-19-1997 Lateral cervical spine, 1-view, showing needle projected over SP of C2.  There is a 
second single view taken several hours later showing wire suture around the 
posterior elements of C1-2.   
11-19-1997 Lateral cervical spine by Robert Hart, M. D., 1-view.  This s hows wire suture around 
posterior elements of C1-2.   
11-20-1997 There is a 2-view cervical spine study which shows no loss of reduction compared to 
the examination of yesterday.  Drainage tube is in place in the AP view.   
11-20-1997 2-view cervical spine x-ray series read by Robert R. Hart, M.D.  Shows fusion of C1 
and C2 with no loss of reduction. 
11-23-1997 Discharge summary prepared by Arthur B.  Schuller, M.D.  Nothing interesting.   
 
 812-15-1997 This is a post-operative cervical spine series interpreted by Robert Hart, M.D.  
Shows fusion at C1-2 with wires around the pos terior elements of these vertebrae.  
The odontoid is not well visualized on the lateral view.  There is no apparent change 
in it’s position.  Compare examination of 11-20-97 and 11-19-97, which was intra-operative at that time.  The head and neck are supported in a brace resting on the shoulders.   
12-15-1997 Chart notes from Dr. Hsu.  Surgical  fusion was on 11-19-97.  He tolerated the 
procedure well.  In the past several days he’s been experiencing more pain in the 
region of the anterior Halo pins.  There is clear fluid drainage from the pins.  Also 
some redness around the pin sites.  The pins were changed in the front under sterile conditions.  He is now taking Dicloxacillin.   
12-15-1997 Post-operative cervical spine x-rays.  R ead by Dr. Hart.  No apparent change from 
examination of 11-20 and 11-19-97.   
12-27-1997 Mercy Medical Center Mt . Shasta Emergency Room record.  Mr. Ponse was in today 
for tachycardia and lightheadedness.   
12-27-1997 AP chest x-ray reported by K. Ledor, M.D.  This is a normal chest. 
12-28-1997 ER record/report from T. E. Morris, M.D.  This describes Mr. Ponse coming in with a 
fairly abrupt onset of lightheadedness, rapid heart beat, sensation of heat, and sweat.  He had no chest pain, difficulty breathing, etc.  He’s got a pulse of (?).  Otherwise, 
most of his vital signs and physical examination findings were normal.  Assessment was new onset paroxysmal supraventricul ar tachycardia.  Hyperphophatemia.  
Cervical spondylosis status post surgery.  Patient’s held on medical outpatient observation in ICU on continuous cardiac monitoring.   
12-30-1997 Records from W. Sam Williams, Jr., M.D.    Mr. Ponse has had problems since his 
earliest childhood (apparently referring to tac hycardia).  He was recently hospitalized 
with SVT of greater than 200.  Since that  time he’s been on Lopressor, 50 mg q.d., 
from the hospital stay.  He’s been followed in cardiology by Dr. Shnug.  He 
continues with Halo support.   
01-14-1998 This is a 3-view cervical spine study read by Dr. Hart.  C1 -2 shows fusion wires 
attached.  No loss of reduction or appearance from previous exam of 12-15-97.  Brace is in place.   
01-14-1998 This is a 3-view cervical series.  S hows fusion wires attached to the posterior 
elements of C1-2 with no loss of reducti on compared to the films of 12-15-97.  The 
head is in a brace.   
01-14-1998 Chart notes from Dr. Hsu.  Mr. Ponse’s condition has improved, however, he is 
having significant with the Halo  pins.  The Halo jacket was removed today.  A SOMI 
brace was applied instead.   
01-14-1998 3-view cervical spine x-ray series read by Dr. Hart.  Same as others. 
01-21-1998 Chart notes from W. Sam Williams, Jr., M.D.  He was having some irritation from 
the Halo brace.  It was recently remove d.  He has had no further episodes of 
tachycardia.  He was seen by Dr. Shnug ( now spelled Schnugg).  He’s been reassured 
by Dr. Schnugg.  He’s taking a beta blocker now.   
02-03-1998 Chart notes from Dr. Williams.  This concerns recent hematuria which was noted at 
the hospital when he was having surgery a nd recent anemia.  Both of these have 
 
 9resolved.  UA reveals 1+ glucose.  Random  finger stick is 171.  Mr. Ponse has had 
elevations in the past.  Apparently he has had previous GTTs which proved to be 
normal.   
02-23-1998 Letter to Dr. DeLong from Dr. Hsu.  Mr. Ponse is gradually improving and has less 
pain.  He is neurologically intact.  The x-rays look good.  He is comfortable in the 
SOMI brace.  He’s going to continue to wear that brace for one more month.   
02-23-1998 2-view cervical spine x-ray study reported by Daniel Lentz, M.D.  The patient’s in a 
neck brace.  Post-traumatic deformity is noted at C1 level with evidence of old 
odontoid process fracture.  The posteri orly positioned odontoid does not appear 
definitively changed in alignment on the lateral view (he’s comparing to 12-15-97 and 01-14-98 x-rays) as compared to the prio r studies.  The other cervical levels are 
notable for degenerative changes. 
03-06-1998 There is a handwritten note signed by J.E.   Patient called about his recent vertigo 
symptoms.  He went to his M.D. as directed and he passed all tests (ears, simple neuro, CVC, comprehensive (?) panel, etc.).  Doctor said check is fine.   
03-24-1998 Cervical spine multiple views (not men tioned which views).  Reported by Robert R. 
Hart, M.D.  Wire sutures are holding together well.  With flexion and extension views, there is no evidence of motion at this  level.  Disc space at C3-4 is narrowed 
and the one at C5-6 is narrowed.  The former is narrowed more than the latter.   
03-31-1998 Mt. Shasta Physical Therapy and We llness Clinic form.  Describing confirmed 
cervical fusion took place.  This is a former client.  Current activity level is light.   
03-31-1998 Two page letter from Linda Stremel, P.T., Mt. Shasta Physical Therapy.  She 
describes lifting precaution of 10 pounds.  Currently he’s got constant upper 
trapezius/shoulder pain and soreness secondary to months of wearin g rigid brace.  He 
rates this pain at 1/10 and states that it precludes him lying on his side.  Indicates 
acromioclavicular origin of this pain as well as upper trapezius bilaterally.  The AC 
stress test is positive.  He also complain s of cervical pain with excessive upper 
extremity use or talking on the phone or writi ng or reading at a ta ble.  Cervical ROM 
is flexion to 8 degrees, extension to 15 degrees, side bending on the right to 10 
degrees, on the left to 8 degrees.  Axial rota tion is 10 degrees bilaterally.  He’s really 
guarding his cervical motion.  He also has weakness of cervical musculature manifested by cervical fatigue with walking over a mile or prolonged activity such as driving.  He has tightness and tenderness to palpation of the entire cervical, upper 
trapezius, levator scapulae and interscapular regions.  He has normal reflexes and sensation equal bilaterally.   
05-14-1998 There is a prescription form for massa ge and myofascial release and strengthening 
exercises post-op two times per week for six weeks, signed by Dr. DeLong.   
05-15-1998 Notes from Mt. Shasta Physical Therapy signed by Stremel, P.T.  Able to work 5-10 
minutes writing or reading at table.  Daily  episodes of pain 2/10 level, otherwise 
comfortable.  Active cervical ROM: flexi on 24 degrees, extension 32 degrees, side 
bending to right 20 degrees, left 15 degrees, axial rotation to right 15 degrees, left 22 
degrees.  He’s beginning to use his cervi cal range during conversation and daily 
activities rather than guarding against cervical motion.  
06-22-1998 Handwritten notes from Dr. DeLong.  Diffi cult to read these.  Appears to say doing 
 
 10well, some “popping” in the neck--probably related to the mid cervical spondylosis 
(seems as though he was attributing this earlie r to progressive instability at C1-2).  
Incision is healing well and is nontender.  Bone bridging C1-2 posteriorly.  Cable is 
intact.  Recommended cannot return to railr oad work as conductor/brakeman.  He is 
to see Dr. Hsu in two months and Dr. DeLong in four months, then PRN.   
06-22-1998 Chart notes from Dr. Hsu.  Mr. P onse has improved significantly.  He has no 
significant pain.  He is neurologically in tact.  X-rays showed good fusion.  He has 
been advised to use good body mechanics and avoid stressful activities.   
06-23-1998 Cervical spine AP/LAT and AP-dens vi ew.   Read by John Gartland, M.D.  This 
compared with the 03-24-98 and other studies .  The cerclage wire is seen with no 
position change.  There is marked disc space narrowing at C3-4 with slight posterolithesis of C3 on C4.  Degenerative ch anges at C6-7 are also again present.  
No fractures or destructive lesions are present.   
08-31-1998 Letter to Dr. DeLong from Dr. Hsu.  Mr. Ponse has improved significantly, his 
headaches and upper neck pain have resolv ed.  He still has mid and lower cervical 
pain which is most likely due to degenerative disc and facet disease.  He is getting physical therapy which seems to help.  He is able to walk about 30 minutes at one 
stretch.  He has no tenderness over the upper cervical spine.  There is mild 
tenderness over the mid lower cervical spine.  He’s neurologically intact and x-rays 
look good.   
08-31-1998 AP/LAT cervical spine x-ray.  Read by J ohn Gorder, M.D.  Compared with the June 
22 and other films.  AP/LAT films again de monstrate posterior fusion of C1-2 with 
figure of eight wire.  There appears to be boney fusion across the spinous processes as well.   No flexion/extension view taken today.   
10-20-1998 Letter to Ronald Henderson, M.D., from Dr. DeLong.  This is a reevaluation of Mr. 
Ponse.  Flexion/extension x-rays demonstrate that the fusion is solid.  He is doing well.  He’s had a flare-up of mid to lowe r cervical pain in connection with some 
computer classes he’s taking at school.  Pr olonged flexion of the head and neck and 
repetitive use of the mouse are bothering him.  This is probably the result of flaring up of the mid cervical spondylosis demonstrated on x-rays.  (Probably secondary to fixation of C1-2.)   Although he was thinking about some computer career he is apparently making plans to change his vocational rehabilitation.  Neurologically, he remains intact.  He feels that symptoms ar e considerably better now than they were 
pre-operatively, but they are not as good as th ey were before he started the computer 
classes.  He should continue with the physical therapist.  He’s now on a supervised workout program.  He’s going to have a follow up in one year, or sooner if need be.   
10-26-1999 This is a deposition of Charles Ponse.   He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in 
Corrections.  He has a Master of Arts de gree in Counseling (marriage, family, child 
counseling).  He worked for the railroad be fore going to college and did not work in 
corrections or counseling, but returned to the railroad after college.  Page 10  He 
worked at a service station (Texaco) duri ng high school and college and later worked 
for U.S. Plywood.  Page 11  He also worked  as a furniture assembler and deliverer.  
He also worked for a logging company.  He  was a choker-setter, he wrapped cables 
around logs and hooked them to a tractor.  Page  12   He then worked at International 
 
 11Paper Company as a chain-off bearer.  He also worked as a laborer and carpenter 
helper.  In 1973 he first started working for the railroad.  Page 11  He was cut off in 
1975 and went back and did  his master’s pr ogram.  Page 14   He denies any work-
related or personal injuries while at any of the other employers.  Page 15   He was in 
the National Guard from 1965-1971.  Page 16   His MOS was heavy truck driver.  
Page 17   He did not do any active duty and was honorably discharged.  Page 18   He 
started as a brakeman at Southern Pacific Railroad, later he got rights as a conductor. 
 He is not an engineer.  Page 19   He la st worked for the railroad in February 1997.  
He has not applied for any other job since then.  Page 20   However, he plans to 
eventually.  He is currently enrolled in  school again.  He’s studying photo journalism 
and computer science.  Page 21   He ha s a vocational rehab counselor named Dick 
Cook and he has discussed future employm ent options.  Page 23   He’s asked 
whether he has any difficulties taking thes e classes due to physical problems and 
answers in the affirmative.  His neck gets  real stiff and sore.  Page 25   Also, it 
affects his sleep patterns because when he gets sore he doesn’t sleep well.  It seems to be the computers that aggravate him the most.  Page 26   Also, working in the photo lab.  It causes him to take breaks.  He’s asked whether he would continue 
working at the railroad if a job within  his physical capacities was offered and 
answered yes.  Page 27   He was apparen tly contacted by the railroad who wanted to 
put him in contact with a vocational rehab counselor named Melinda Sells, but he did not contact her, primarily because he felt that she was connected with the Claims Department at the Railroad.  Page 28   He expects to be completed with college in 
May or June of 2001.  Page 31   He is asked what he does in the average day and 
replies that he starts the morning with exer cises, lots of stretching and isometrics for 
his neck and body.  He takes a long walk every day then he comes home and does 
some work at his computer or he goes to co llege.  He’s also fond of fishing.  Page 32 
  He’s married and he also does some household chores.  He’s also done some deer hunting since February 1997, five or six times.  Page 35   He stated that since his 
surgery he’s not able to hunt.  Page 38   He’s also unable to duck hunt.  He’s been 
told by his doctor that the recoil would ex acerbate the condition of his neck.  He 
doesn’t travel much because it bothers his neck to drive.  He’s not currently taking medication for pain.  Page 39   Last time he saw a doctor for his neck was October 
1998.  That was Dr. DeLong and Dr. Hsu.  He parenthetically adds that he’s not able now to work on his car because he has a 25 pound lifting restriction and he has difficulty getting underneath the car.  Page 39-40   He also can’t mow the lawn, do 
painting or carpentry types of activities.  Doctors that he’s seen include Dr. 
Henderson, Dr. Weinstein, Dr. Hsu, Dr. DeL ong, Dr. Miller and Dr. Schuller.  There 
is also a comment about Dr. Sam Williams, but it is not clear whether he saw that 
doctor.  Page 43   The first time he recalls  having any stiffness or pain in his neck 
was approximately July 1996.  Page 44   This  was an insidious onset.  Pain in the 
right shoulder and pain in the right side of  the neck and into the right side of his 
head.  He has had some improvement in n eck pain since the surgery.  Page 46   
Things that aggravate it now include sitting in one place, not moving for long periods 
of time, driving.  Also using his hands a lo t for different chores or working at the 
 
 12keyboard or typewriter.  He’s asked whet her he had any specific strenuous episodes 
at work that might have precipitated the condition and he responds negatively.  He’s 
also asked about dental, specifically, a note from a Dr. Henderson dated February 
1997 that says “six months ago the patient had some extensive de ntal work done and 
began having pain in his neck as well as his scapula.”  Page 47   He doesn’t recall 
having any extensive dental work done.  Page 48    Also there is some question as to 
a medical history indicating onset of symp toms in July or August 1996 from wearing 
a two pound harness wrapped around his neck which held a radio pack.  Page 48   He’d had this harness for about two years.  Page 49   He’s asked whether he believes 
the harness was responsible for any of his n eck symptoms in July 1996.  Page 50   He 
answers that he doesn’t really have an answer one way or another.  Page 51   There is also a history of a previous shoulder injury (no details given).  Page 51   The injury 
was in 1991 while he was working for the railroad.  He also might have injured his right shoulder in about 1977.  Th at was also with the railroad.  Page 53   He denies 
any problems with his right shoulder afte r the 1991 injury which was apparently a 
sprain or a strain.  Approximately 1994-1995 he also saw a doctor for some pain in his scapula on the right side.  Page 53   He does not recall any pain or stiffness in his 
neck prior to 1996.  He believes the job is responsible for his neck problems.  Page 
54   He’s asked whether he took any days off related to his neck problems between 
July 1996 and February 1997 and answers that  he might have taken five to seven 
days off after seeing Dr. Miller at the Medford Clinic (time frame not provided).  Page 56   He’s asked whether he got a personal injury report for his neck and says no.  He’s asked why not and he answers that he did not have any specific injury that 
was reportable.  Asked for clarification he  repeats “I didn’t have a specific accident 
or injury that would have required filling out a report.”  Page 56-57   He’s asked 
what specifically Dr. DeLong had told hi m might be contributing to his neck 
problems (i.e. from work).  He did not recall specifics.  Page 57   As per his opinions 
today, he believes that riding on cabooses and engines contributed to his neck 
problem.  Not only the slack action but also the fact that the seat mounting is sloppy. 
 Apparently there is a post that goes down in to a hole or holder that has a lot of slack 
in it.  Also tying hand brakes.  Page 57   He goes on to discuss how throwing 
switches “beat his body down.”  Page 58   He describes how  tying brakes was also 
contributing.  He primarily would be in awkward positions and using mostly one side of his body.  It was ergonomically unhealthful.  Page 59   The last time he rode in a caboose was in the middle or late 80's.  Page 59-60   Regarding the seats in the 
cabooses, he stated that with a lot of slack action they didn’t provide any support for your back or neck and during episodes of real slack action, they ’d bounce you all the 
way off your seat.  Page 61   Over the c ourse of several pages he’s been asked 
whether he ever reported or rather complain ed to any of his co-workers about any of 
these various conditions which he believe s may have contributed to his neck 
problems and, with the exception of riding in the cabooses, which is discussed on Page 60, his answers are no.  He’s also remi nded that he is a member of the United 
Transportation Union and that might have  been a place to file some type of 
complaint about the conditions of the seats and the cabooses and again did not.  Page 
 
 1362   He’s also asked whether he was treated by a physician for a ny slack action in the 
caboose and he answers no.  Page 62   He’s  asked, specifically, what is it about the 
seats that doesn’t provide suppo rt.  Page 62-63   The answer is not much seat cushion 
on both parts of the seat.  Also the backs we ren’t very high.  Your head and part of 
your shoulders would hang over the back part of the seat.  These were old bench type 
seats.  Also there weren’t any foot supports .  There were also some seats that had 
higher backs.  These did have better back and neck support.  Page 63-64   After the 
cabooses went out of service he rode the train on the head end.  Page 64  He thought 
there were problems with the seats on the lo comotives as well.  Page 64-65   Again, 
there was no upper back or neck support and, due to poor fitting s eat posts, there was 
a lot of sideways or back and forth wobble.   He’s asked whether he ever made any 
complaints about that and answers yes.  This was only to his co-workers.  Page 65   
Another complaint that he has is a lack of seatbelts.  Page 66   In 1991 they typically worked three man crews on a road job.  This involved a trainman, engineer, 
conductor, and a brakeman.  (I’m assuming trainman is synonymous with engineer 
based on the way this is stated.)  Page 68   Assuming there is no helpers, typically the three man crew would ride at the head end.  Page 69  Clarification: engineer, 
conductor and brake man is the three man crew.  Page 69   Ponse notes that on a particular run, working with a three man crew , there may be five switches to throw.  
Page 73   On other runs, it may be 8-10 switc hes.  He would tie or untie as many as 
10-15, or perhaps more.  Page 73-74   Apparently there was a negotiated deal between the railroad and the union to go from a three man crew to a two man crew.  Ponse believes that it may have been sometime in 1992.  Page 75   He stated that he did complain to someone but cannot recall who about this change because it was harder working.   Page 76   Speaking of the “Red Bluff local”, he often worked as a brakeman and would throw a switch probably 50- 70 times.  This is in one shift.  Page 
79   He’s asked about the last 10 years, specifically,  what was the hardest part of your job physically.  He answers that it was picking up and setting out cars.  Page 82 
  He was working by himself rather than w ith one other man and that required him to 
throw more switches, tie more brakes, untie more brakes, walk the area tests, the whole works.  Page 82   He did recall maki ng several complaints to the road master, 
Dave Holloman, about being difficult to th row switches.  Page 83   He also 
comments that it seemed to be useless to complain about things since the railroad 
never really seemed to act on those complain ts.  Page 84   He’s asked whether he’s 
claiming in his lawsuit that the vibration in either the locomotives or the cabooses contributed to his neck problems and answer s that, to the extent the seats wobbled 
around, yes.  Page 86-87  He’s asked to describe his initial pain in his neck and shoulder and he characterizes it as a stabbi ng pain.  Page 88   The pain was in the 
back and the top of the shoulder and then coming into the neck and up into the right 
side of his head.  Apparently, the pain  was limited from the top of the shoulder 
(indication where the stitch marks would be on a shirt connecting the sleeve to the torso portion) and never extended down into the arm at all.  Page 88   Since the 
surgery he doesn’t get much pain in the shoulder but he does in his neck.  It is now a stiffness and more of an aching pain.  Pa ge 89  Referring to the last time he saw a 
 
 14doctor in October 1998, he’s asked whether he was given any specific instructions 
for treatment afterwards.  He answers that  he was told to wear a brace when he’s 
operating a vehicle or in any kind of precarious situations.  Page 89-90   He self-
medicates with Tylenol and Advil.  When  his neck is feeling good maybe three to 
four times per week, other times as much as  several times per day.  Page 90   He’s 
been told that he might require anothe r surgery by Dr. DeLong and Dr. Hsu.  Page 
90-91   He wore a halo brace for two months after his surgery.  Page 91   He has not 
had any numbness or tingling since the surg ery.  Page 92  He never had numbness in 
his shoulder or neck.  He’s asked what pe rcentage of time he worked in cabooses 
before they were eventually phased out and answers about 40%, either as a brakeman or a conductor.  Page 93   He’s aske d how long it takes to throw a switch and 
answers three to four seconds.  He’s asked how long it would take  to tie down a hand 
brake and responds five to eight seconds.  Depends on how long the chain is.  Page 95   He’s asked how may knuckles he had to carry a distance greater than 10 feet.  He estimates probably not more than 50.  As ked what’s the farthest distance he had 
to carry one, he answered probably 30 cars or better, but that was with an assistant.  
Page 96   The farthest he ever carried one by himself was 10 or possibly 15 cars.  
Page 97  He did this several times in his career.  He believes this also contributed to his neck injury.  These things apparently  weighed 80 pounds.  Page  97   He’s asked 
whether slack action is experienced more  at the head end than on cabooses and 
answers, not necessarily, no.  Page 98   He thinks they are about the same.  It was more intense on the cabooses.  Page 99   There was usually no slack action going uphill.  But he experienced this slack action 40-50 times going to Klammath Falls, for example. Page 99  He’s asked if he w ould characterize any of these as severe and 
whether they tossed him out of his seat a nd answers yes.  He’s asked how may times 
during his career this might have happened and answers probably 100 or more.  Page 
99-100   He did not report any of these even ts.  He also was asked whether he had 
ever experienced any equipment problems in cluding seats being torn from the floor 
or coming apart from the mounts and he says  yes, probably half a dozen occasions.  
However, he did not report it because he t hought it was part of the job.  Page 100   
He stated that he smokes occasionally.  Page  102   Regarding lifting restrictions, he’s 
been told to limit it to 20, but occasionally  25 would be okay.  Pa ge 116   No other 
restrictions regarding standing, sitting, or wa lking.  He’s asked whether, in February 
1997, he went off duty by his own choice or was he told to do it by a physician.  He 
answers it was his own choice because he wa s in so much pain he didn’t think he 
could work anymore.  Page 120   The firs t doctor he saw was in late February or 
early March and his name was Henderson.  Page 121

Dear Mr. Roger Williams and Mr. Terry Barris: 
 
I have been retained in this case to provide an objective assessment of the report provided 
by Dr. Michael Masterson dated 7 May, 2004, which was based on his review of the 
medical records and other material provided him. Because I have not yet had the opportunity to review these medical and other records myself , I will confine my 
comments to those issues discussed by Dr. Masterson that can be discussed in the absence of that information. I have also re viewed other records as described below, 
which pertain more to the issues of crash mechanics. At a latter date, having reviewed 
medical records, I may provide an adde ndum report and opinions concerning that 
material. 
 
 
My Qualifications 
 
I hold a doctorate of chiropractic degree (DC)  and have been board certified in both 
orthopaedics and forensic medicine (American Board of Chiropractic Orthopaedists and American Board of Forensic Medicine). I ha ve also been trained as traffic collision 
investigation and automobile cr ash reconstruction at Northw estern University’s Traffic 
Institute. I hold undergraduate degrees in  both general science and biology (BS), a 
Master’s of Science (MS) de gree in human biology, and a Ma ster’s in Public Health 
(MPH), specializing in trauma epidemiology. 
 
I have been actively engaged in the research of whiplash injuries for 22 years and have 
conducted full scale, human subject crash test s at the Spine Research Institute of San 
Diego for the past five years. To date, we  have conducted approximately 100 such tests, 
involving approximately 180 subjec ts in total. We are the only institution that conducts 
ongoing human subject vehicle-to-vehicle crash tests in the U.S. We have also worked 
with the manufacturers of th e rear impact dummies (RID) in this regard, providing 
validation data for the further development of these systems.

I have published the results of this work and have presented the results at international conferences on whiplash, at in ternational engineering conf erences, and through frequent 
continuing education programs in the U.S. (please refer to my CV for specifics).  
 
I have served as an expert witness in we ll over a thousand cases in  the U.S., including 
many low speed automobile crashes resulting in alleged injury or bodily harm, as well as in fatal crashes. I have been qualified in th e Superior courts of ma ny U.S. states. I have 
also been employed as a consulta nt to most of the major automobile insurers in the U.S. 
and have testified on behalf of both defendants and plaintiffs in  well over one hundred 
trials in the past two decades. I have also been involved in a number of Federal cases in 
recent years. 
 
Having co-authored the oldest widely published textbook on whiplash  trauma, and having 
devoted my career to automotive safety vi s-à-vis whiplash-like trauma, and having 
presented ongoing yearly conferences in the U.S. which focus on each year’s new and relevant research, I consider myself adequate ly informed on the topic and fully capable to 
offer the following expert opinions based not only on my own research, but also on the 
balance of currently available science and my  experience as a forensic consultant and 
clinician.  
 
 
Review of Documents 
 
 
Notice of Accident Claim Form 
 
This is a claim form for the 16 July, 2001 collision and was filled out by Mr. Harvey. 
From his description and diagram of the cr ash, it appears his vehicle was struck in a 
nearly perpendicular vector on the right re ar corner as he was turning right around a 
roundabout. The resulting occupant kinematic  response would have been complicated, 
consisting largely of right lateral flexion with an elemen t of rotation, and head-strike 
against the B-pillar or side  window would be likely, depending on the magnitude of the 
crash and Mr. Harvey’s level of awarene ss, bracing, and physical  strength. He was 
driving a 1998 Toyota Corolla se dan. The other vehicle was no t described in this report. 
Attached to this form is a Medical Certifi cate form. I cannot read all of the handwritten 
comments, but there appears to be a statement that Mr. Harvey’s head did strike the side 
window. There also appears to be a note about  a concussion, whipla sh to the cervical 
spine, and pain in the thor acic and upper lumbar regions. 
 
 
Motor Accident Personal Injury Notice of Claim 
 
This is a multiple page document, filled out by Mr. Harvey, that documents his account of the crash of 29 January, 2000. His description of the crash is larg ely concordant with 
those of other reports. His diagram of the crash vector is concordant wi th that provided in 
Mr. Stephen Harvey 
Page 3 of 19 
 
 
the Dearborn report below. Mr. Harvey finds fa ult with the driver of the car that struck 
him from the rear as he was stopped on Airport Ave. He attri butes cervical spine, thoracic 
spine, lumbar spine injuries to the crash, as well as headaches, radiating pain in both 
upper extremities, shock, stress, and anxiety. These result in sleeping difficulties, pain 
during working, driving, and computer work, easy fatigability, decreased motivation, difficulty in concentrating, and moodine ss. These are fairly common squealae to 
whiplash injury with compone nts of mild traumatic brain injuries (e.g., concussion). He 
described undergoing a regime  of physical therapy and strengthening exercises. 
 
 
Statements Taken by Dearborn Liability 
 
I have read statements made by Valmai  Tanker on 18 January, 2003, in which she 
described the crash of January 2000, attribut ing blame to Mr. Harvey for stopping on the 
roadway. Other components of her statement are encompassed in the discussion that follows, particularly as it rela tes to Dr. Masterson’s report.  
 
I have read the statement of David McDuga l, the owner of the vehicle driven by Ms. 
Tanker. This statement is dated 20 Januar y, 2003. He described his observations and 
actions regarding this Falcon taxi cab, which are, again, the subject of further discussion 
below. 
 
I have read the statement of Darren Gadfl y, a therapist who worked with Mr. Harvey. 
This statement is dated 18 November, 2003. He claimed to have little continual contact with Mr. Harvey, but was aware of the claimed injuries. 
 
I have read the statement of Stephanie Mc Mahon, a former employee of Mr. Harvey, who 
provides some additional gene ral information and opinions regarding the business owned 
by Mr. Harvey. She and other staff were let go in November of 2002, which she understood to be a consequence of Mr. Harvey’s injuries. She noted that  it did not appear 
that the business had been faltering subsequent  to that time and the staff downsizing came 
as a shock to her.  
 
I have read a brief recounting of an interv iew with two other former employees of Mr. 
Harvey: Xavier Sarbjit, and Cameron Foster . Due to reported “technical difficulties,” 
however, this conversation was not recorded. Neither were willing to go into detail in 
their conversations with th e interviewer and both appare ntly—like Ms. McMahon—were 
not pleased with being made “redundant.” Portions of this report has been redacted. In this addendum report there is also a descrip tion of a conversation with Suzanne Joseph, 
another former employee of Mr. Harvey, w ho had been encouraged by Ms. McMahon to 
be interviewed. She also declined to make a statement, but did discuss her employment 
and other general issues relating to that business. She was only tangentially aware of Mr. 
Harvey’s medical problems and was aware (as other statements had reflected) that Mr. 
Harvey was a golfer. This was highlighted in bold letters by the writer of this report.

In general, these statements do not provide mu ch in the way of useful information to me, 
forensically, with the exceptions of the first two, which are discussed below. The only comments that appear to be pot entially relevant are those de scribing the playing of golf 
and working long hours. Golf is game that is physically not typi cally challenging for 
persons suffering from whiplash and other spinal  injuries. People who are so disabled that 
they can no longer play golf, generally ar e disabled from most forms of gainful 
employment. The fact that he can play golf ha s little probative value one way or another, 
in my view. Moreover, golf appears to play an integral role in Mr. Harvey’s business. It 
has also been shown that work status is not a valid proxy for pain. 
 
 
Collision Repair Order 
 
I have reviewed a collision repair order fr om Norspray Panel & Pa int concerning a Ford 
Falcon AU Forte sedan. This document wa s dated 12 May, 2000.  The repair estimate 
was to replace the right rear tail light asse mbly and to repair the rear bar cover and 
replace rivets. The estimate for repairs totals $789.94. 
 
 
Report by Dearborn Liability Consultants 
 
I reviewed a report dated 27 January, 2003 fr om Dearborn Liability  Consultants. The 
author of this report, Brett Thorburn, did not draw any specific conclusions regarding 
causation or injury risk, nor di d he report any crash metrics or perform a formal accident 
reconstruction. He did make several comments  which made an allusion to risk, however, 
but these comments were based in part on wi tness statements from the defendant (Ms. 
Tanker) in crash #1. Moreover, neither of the two actual subject vehicles were examined 
by Mr. Thorburn. Exemplar vehicles were ex amined instead. The model years of the 
proxy vehicles was provided, along with a number of measurements, including bumper heights for both vehicles.  
 
Mr. Dearborn observes that the bumper of the bullet vehicle is lower than the tail light 
assembly of the target vehicle,  suggesting that it would have been unlikely that an impact 
between these vehicles would have caused that type of damage. However, having 
reviewed the photographs provide d in this document, the actu al projection of the front 
bumper beyond the tail light and head light regions of these two vehicles is quite small 
and, considering the compression of the bumpers  at full crash engagement (which can be 
several inches), this type of structural  damage is both likely and common in my 
experience.  It is also noteworthy and some what surprising that th e vehicle masses were 
not reported here.  
 
There is another comment that offers some  verisimilitude for the assumption that an 
injury to Mr. Harvey would have been unlikel y (if that, in fact, was the intent of this 
report): the fact that the taxi  driver (Ms. Tanker) was not wearing seat belts, yet she was 
not injured. In fact, this is not  surprising. We have shown in our  tests that drivers of bullet 
Mr. Stephen Harvey 
Page 5 of 19 
 
 
vehicles (i.e., those striking the other car) experience only one quarter to one third the 
amount of head acceleration as do drivers of the target vehicle (the vehicle that is 
struck)(1,2). Their risk for injury is consider ably lower than the dr iver of the target 
vehicle, and at these speeds, seat belts do not afford additional protec tion to either driver. 
Moreover, Mr. Harvey was wear ing his seat belts and, paradoxically, this has been shown 
rather unequivocally, to increase the risk of  injury in rear im pact crashes (4-11). 
Additionally, he had his head turned at impact (12-14), fl exed forward (15-21),  and 
claims to have been unaware of the imp ending crash (21-24)—all of which are known 
risk factors in whiplash (references pr ovided, respectively, in parentheses). Mr. 
Thornburg did not make any commen t about these risk factors.  
 
There is also a diagram of the crash indicating an oblique rear  collision in which the left 
corner of bullet’s front bumper contacted the right corner of the target’s rear bumper, 
which would have been consistent with the reported damage to the two vehicles and 
which, more importantly, would have resu lted in an overall oblique and more 
physiologically challenging occ upant kinematic. This would have greatly increased the 
likelihood of unilateral facet join t injury and disc injury in the cervical spine, especially 
coupled with head rotation. Thoracic and lu mbar spine injury is likely as well.  
 
Overall, the probative value of this report is, in my estim ation, marginal. No formal 
reconstruction was attempted, most of the info rmation came from witness statements or 
examination of exemplar vehicles, which might  not have been full proxies for the subject 
vehicles and, in any case, did not allow a careful cataloging of the actual damage to the 
subject vehicles, and many important factor s concerning heightened risk were omitted, 
while several comments suggesting a lowered risk were made. [I will discuss these other factors below.] 
 
 
Report of Dr. Michael Masterson 
 
I have reviewed the CV of Dr. Masterson as well as a report he authored concerning Mr. 
Harvey’s two motor vehicle crashes and cl aimed injuries. The report is dated 7 May, 
2004. Dr. Masterson appears to be well vers ed and highly experienced in general 
automotive safety and engineering, particularly as related to restraint systems and bicycle 
helmets. Upon reviewing his impressive CV , it is clear that he has served on many 
prestigious panels, in numerous governmenta l agencies, and has participated in many 
automotive safety projects over the past 30 or so years.  It appears he has not published extensively in the area of low speed rear impact  crash injury or prev ention, however. It is 
also not clear whether he has had formal training in automobile crash reconstruction. 
 
Dr. Masterson has essentially concluded that in neither of th e two motor vehicle crashes; 
that of 29 January, 2000 (henceforth crash #1) and that of 16 July, 2001 (henceforth crash 
#2), would there have been a sufficient transfer  of energy or force to cause an occupant 
kinematic effect likely to have resulted in the injuries claimed by Mr. Harvey and his physicians. This assessment is based, not on a formal crash reconstr uction, but, rather, on 
Mr. Stephen Harvey 
Page 6 of 19 
 
 
the reliance on the details of  the crash as provided by—in the case of crash #1—the 
defendant driver of the bullet vehicle, Ms. Tanker.   
 
In the second crash, Dr. Masterson uses a ra ther tenuous logic which argues that, since 
the first crash could not have resulted in an injury, the second crash—to which some of 
Mr. Harvey’s treating or examining physicians  attribute only a small aggravation (10%, 
according to Dr. Atkinson) above and beyond the injuries of crash #1—can also be rejected as similarly trivial and unlikely to have produced or aggrav ated an injury. This 
seems a convenient logical convenience in this  case, since Dr. Masterson admittedly has 
little information about the actual crash mechanics or dynamics of the second crash. 
 
 
Detailed Comments 
 
In this section, I have taken Dr. Masters on’s specific comments, with page number 
reference, and offered comments based on wh at I consider to be  the balance of the 
literature and current popular thought in this field of science. Where appropriate I offer specific literature citation. Following this se ction is one entitled “Executive Summary of 
Dr. Masterson’s Conclusions,” in which I wi ll provide a brief, bulleted summary of my 
opinions resulting from this review.  
 
1. The subject (plaintiff) ve hicle of crash #1 was a Ford Falcon AU Sedan of 
unknown (to me) model year. The defendant vehicle was a Ford Falcon ED Sedan 
(taxi), also of unknown model year. In crash #2, the subject vehicle was a 1998 
Toyota Corolla sedan which was struck from  the rear by a Holden sedan; again of 
unspecified model year. 
2. I note that great detail is given to defenda nt number 1 (the taxi driver who rear-
ended Mr. Harvey). Much of her narrative is defensive in nature, placing collision blame on Mr. Harvey. Ms. Tanker claims to  have approached the collision point 
traveling at 20 km/h (12.4 mph) at 3- 4 car lengths behind Mr. Harvey with 
nothing to obscure her view. It is remarkab le that, with such vivid recollection of 
detail, and traveling at such a slow sp eed, a person who drives professionally 
nevertheless managed to co llide with Mr. Harvey.  
3. Just before contact, she estimated her speed at 15 km/h and the closing distance at one car length, but describes accelerating at this point. Thus, at contact, she would 
have been traveling at a speed somewhat greater than 15 km/h. The target vehicle 
was described as stopped in th e left side of the roadway. 
4. She described a right side overtaking crash, as she attempted to maneuver around the right side of the target vehicle. Her vehicle made contact to the right side of 
the target vehicle and came to rest with th e front of her vehicle in the region of the 
right rear driver’s side door  of the target vehicle. This  is not consistent with the 
reported damage for both vehicles and is al so inconsistent with the detailed scene 
diagram I viewed in the Dearborn report. It  may be that she merely continued to 
drive around the right side after the initial impact.

5. I note the comment at bottom of page 7:  “Neither police nor ambulance services 
were required or attended to  at the scene.” This comment (of Dr. Masterson) is 
often tendered by experts to imply that in juries are not likely or severe when 
symptoms are not immediate or subject s do not immediately vi sit the hospital. 
However, the literature is unambiguous th at most soft tissue injuries resulting 
from crash trauma of this kind have sy mptoms that are delayed usually for 24-72 
hours (26-33). In fact, in a recent study, the authors reported the worst outcomes 
in persons in which neck pain was delayed by 24 hours (34). Although the delay 
phenomena is well known, the literature is divided as to the significance of the 
delays in terms of long-term outcomes. 
6. On page 8, he described the claim of Mr. Harvey that the damage was to the rear 
and right side of the vehicle,  but that it apparently was ke pt in its rental service. 
His conclusion from this was that the da mage would have been negligible. He 
commented about a repair bill that “incl uded replacement of the right rear tail 
light assembly.”  
7. On page 8, Dr. Masterson continues quo ting the bullet driver , Ms. Tanker. She 
claimed to have inspected the target vehicl e after the crash and did not see any tail 
light damage. She described a shallow gouge in the right rear portion of the target 
vehicle’s bumper which was about 12 in ches long. She appears to have even 
noticed that the contact point of her vehi cle would not have ma de contact with the 
target vehicle in a way that would break th e tail light as claimed. [Note that I have 
addressed this issue above.] There was no damage other than to the bumper, 
according to Ms. Tanker. 
8. Dr. Masterson then quoted from the Notice of Claim from Ms. Tanker, noting damage form the “Front left and down the left side,” but, conf usingly in the next 
paragraph, she denied any panel damage. The damage, she noted, was to her front bumper in the form of a dislodged front plastic bumper bar, with no structural 
damage to the bumper. [Because Mr. Tanker is not trained in damage analysis and probably did not disassemble the bumper, nor did anyone who 
was qualified from 
what I have read, this comment should be considered unreliable.] 
9. She claimed (page 9) that the taxi owner simply adjusted the damaged part of the bumper fascia and no further repairs were required. This was on the front passenger’s (left) side. This would indicat e an oblique impact between left front 
of bullet and right rear of target produci ng a heightened risk for injury as noted 
earlier. There does not appear to be any disagreement concerning this vector of 
collision. 
10. The taxi owner inspected the target vehicle after the crash and his rather extensive statement is quoted, at least in part, on page 9. In short, he claimed there was no damage to the vehicle, other than some s uperficial damage to the left side of the 
front bumper, which he repaired by hand, leaving the car in the condition it had 
been in “prior to this traffic incident.”  Presumably, it had not been damaged prior. 
[This comment also suffers from a l ack of reliability as in #8 above.] 
11. Dr. Masterson is clearly relying heavily on the statements of the defendant driver 
and the owner of the taxi. In my experi ence, the rather extraordinary detail and 
deliberacy in the recollective statements  of both Ms. Tanker and Mr. McDugal, 
Mr. Stephen Harvey 
Page 8 of 19 
 
 
the taxi owner, should recommend some caution. In my experience, even in 
controlled experiments, direct observers of crashes at these speeds cannot agree 
on the particulars of the cr ash with more than a marginal degree of detail.  
12. Dr. Masterson, on page 11 of his report, all udes to a series of frontal, fixed barrier 
crash tests conducted by the NRMA. In thes e tests, he reported that at collision 
velocities of 15 km/h, the resulting dama ge to vehicles was typically in the 
neighborhood of $2500. The subtext of this s eems to be that in a crash of the 
nature of crash #1, because the resulting damage was estimated to be less than 
$800 (Norspray Panel and Paint) , the crash speed must have actually been quite a 
bit lower than 15 km/h. [It is noteworthy, however, that this is a speed claimed by 
Ms. Tanker at the time she was actually ac celerating over an additional distance 
she estimated to be one car length (ab out 15 ft). Thus, although Dr. Masterson 
relies heavily on this potentially biased and unreliable recounting as a foundation for most of his conclusions , he selectively rejects it at other times.] The NRMA 
website does not have any data regardi ng these tests and—as is common in his 
report—Dr. Masterson does not provid e specific references to published 
literature. Notwithstanding the limitations  of not being able to verify Dr. 
Masterson’s comments regarding the NRMA findings, in the U.S. similar tests are 
performed by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS) and are published on their website (www.iihs.org). These test s of the IIHS are de signed to inculcate 
auto manufacturers into building more crashworthiness into their bumpers by 
demonstrating to consumers the high cost of low speed crashes in terms of repairs. It is important for consumers to unders tand, however, that crashing into a fixed 
barrier or a pole, as some of these tests require, actually produce more bumper 
and paint damage (the latter of which is a large part of this $2500 repair figure, 
incidentally) than car-to-car collisions. It  is also noteworthy that most of these 
vehicles crashed at 5 mph (8 km/h) that sustain up to $2500 or more in repair bills, do, in fact, have 5 mph-rated bumpers which have passed muster with the bumper code. Translation: much of this repair work is cosmetic, rather than 
structural. Perhaps more importantly, thes e tests are not compar able to car-to-car 
collisions. When both vehicles are equi pped with 5 mph-rated bumpers, we have 
shown in dozens of crash tests over the years that these vehicles can withstand 
rear impacts of up to 16 km/h with no re sulting structural damage beyond minor 
gouge marks in plastic bumper fascia and paint scuffing. In many cases, these cars are subjected to multiple crashes at th ese speeds with no resulting damage. Other 
researchers have produced the same resu lts (35). In actual crash tests, our 
colleagues have crashed passenger cars at speeds of up to 22 km/h with no 
resulting damage. Finally, if one takes Ms. Tanker’s comments at face value, applying the principles of  Newtonian mechanics and considering a conservative 
acceleration value of 6 fps
2 from her stated speed of 15 km/h, over a closing 
distance of 15 ft (one car length), her velocity at impact with Mr. Harvey would 
have been approximately 21 km/h. This speed relationship is demonstrated as follows, where Ve is ending velocity (in ft/sec), Vi is initial velocity, a is 
acceleration (in f/sec
2) and d is distance in feet: 
 
Mr. Stephen Harvey 
Page 9 of 19 
 
 
22 Ve Vi ad=+  
 
219.2 (13.7) 2(6)(15) fps=+  
 
Note that 19.2 fps is approximately 21  km/h. Note also that the editor of Accident 
Investigation Quarterly suggested, based on his research in the state of Texas, that 
more typical acceleration value might be as high as 10 fps2, which would increase 
the calculated crash speed in this cas e to 24 km/h (41). (I cited the more 
conservative value because the defendant was already moving.) The change of velocity of most passenger cars when struck by similar sized cars is usually about 60-70% of the closing velocity when there is little resulting structural damage, as 
in this case. This would put the delta V of Mr. Harvey’s vehicle at 12-14 km/h. 
And, although Dr. Masterson did cite this important literature  (footnote 35, page 
19), he failed to note that some of these auth ors have reported that  injuries to test 
subjects begin to occur in speed changes (delta Vs) of about 5 mph (8 km/h) (35-
39). Note also that some of our colleagues have produced a signi ficant number of 
injuries at speeds as low as 4 km/h ( 40)—and it is especially noteworthy that 
these are volunteers: medically screened to  participate with no known risk factors 
such as a history of migraine headache s, who do not have the additional risk 
factors of non-awareness, head-turned a nd flexed position, as did Mr. Harvey. We 
have also produced a number of injuries  in crashes of under 15 km/h. Note also 
that the bumper height measurements reported in the Dearborn Liability 
Consultants document reviewed above re veals that bumper-to-bumper contact 
would have been maintained in this 1
st crash, which would have been consistent 
with most crash test studies. The masses of the two vehicles are nearly the same 
(Ford AU Falcon, 1445 kg; Ford ED Falc on GL, 1490 kg). Bumper alignment and 
overlap is illustrated below.

13. It is noteworthy that, throughout his re port, Dr. Masterson repeatedly calls 
attention to minute variations in the record ed history of the va rious providers, the 
subtext of which appears to be that Harv ey is most likely fabricating the details 
and cannot keep the story st raight in his mind over time. Dr. Masterson, however, 
being a physician himself, must surely be familiar with this historical variance, 
which is often partly a reflection of how physicians translate and transcribe the details provided to them by patients. Mo reover, these nuances do not in any place 
appear to me to be particul arly ambiguous or contradictory. 
14. On page 18 of his report, Dr. Masterson informs the reader that rear impact 
crashes has been the subject of “considerab le recent research.”  This is certainly 
true, although he cites very little of it and appears to be either largely unfamiliar 
with it or unwilling to accept its conclusions. He does cite, for example, a paper by Allen et al. (42), a pape r that has become the darling of the community who 
decry whiplash injury as fraud, but the butt of endless jokes among the scientific 
community. It is very possibly the single most egregiously flawed paper on the 
subject, as we have demons trated (43). He goes on to ci te papers by my engineer 
colleagues Szabo and Welcher, who I have worked closely with over the past five 
years (footnote 36, page 19), as summarizi ng the crash test lite rature as showing 
that crashes of 8-11 km/h ar e “well within adult toleran ce levels.” This statement 
is misleading and unqualified, however . A team of statisticians, and 
epidemiologists (including myself) have di scussed this issue at length elsewhere 
(43). 
In essence, there is no know injury  tolerance level based on delta V, 
particularly one that can be extrapol ated to all occupants under any crash 
condition . These crash tests do not attempt to establish tolerance limits with 
scientific certainly and are extremely lim ited in this extent. Many confuse this 
issue in order to attempt to simplify this very multifarious subject, but the wider body of scientific evidence condemns the pr actice. The subjects of these crash 
tests are tested under non-representativ e crash conditions, they are medically 
healthy and thus cannot repr esent the universe of crash victims, the number of 
crashes is too low in these studies to apply tests of statistical significance, all risk factors that can be eliminated are eliminated, and—usually—there are no long-
term follow-up examinations of subjects . This latter fact has allowed some 
authors to promote further misleading statements such as, “no studies have demonstrated any significant long-term effects.” I am aware of only one study, 
other than our own, that has followed these subject more than a few weeks. The other literature that is important in this regard is the world epidemiological data, 
and this literature is also voluminous , yet overlooked by Dr. Masterson. In one 
recent U.S. study it was shown that the larges t groups of injured subjects are those 
in no-damage crashes in rear impacts (44). In perhaps the largest and most 
comprehensive study of its kind to date, a German government-sponsored study, 
in which the crashes were reconstructed by experts, the authors clearly implicated 
that a large proportion (40-60% based on all literature) of thos e injured in rear 
impact crashes have no significant or onl y minor structural damage to their 
vehicles (45). Moreover, it has been demonstrated by numerous authors that 
property damage does not directly correlate with injury risk in low speed crashes 
Mr. Stephen Harvey 
Page 11 of 19 
 
 
(46-50), nor does it correlate with the ri sk for long-term symptoms (12,22,51-53). 
Arguments to the contrary run directly counter  to this literature, to science, and to 
real word experience. 
15. Dr. Masterson makes a reference to Meye r et al. and to Maria Krafft et al. 
(footnotes 37 and 38, page 20). The first reference I am not familiar with. However, I believe the author and the s ubject are common to another paper I am 
familiar with (54) which is also critica lly flawed. These German authors reported 
an injury rate of over 30% in their tests, including one man who was symptomatic 
for several weeks, but still declared their tests “harmle ss,” reminiscent, if I might 
say so, perhaps of the type of research that prompted the world community to adopt the Helsinki Doctrine for humane human and animal research in the 1940s. 
Thus, their conclusions concerning harm lessness are preposterous; these crash 
speeds are clearly not harmless even to their own test subjects, much less the universe of real world crash victims. I am familiar with a more recent study by Krafft and colleagues (3). They reported that most of the more severe whiplash 
injuries in their small sample of subjects occurred in crashes of 15 km/h or over, with some in the 20 km/h range. This woul d not be inconsistent with what appears 
to be the range of crash speeds we might estimate in Mr. Harvey’s case. Moreover, the crash pulse recorders used in  these studies are chiefly installed in 
Volvos and Saabs—both of which are known to be some of the safest vehicles vis-à-vis whiplash risk. If the intention is to extrapolate thes e findings to drivers 
of all passenger cars, this selection bias would likely result in a falsely inflated average crash speed. The study would then  suffer from a lack of external validity 
in that the results would not be generaliz able to, for example, Holdens, Toyotas, 
and Falcons. 
16. On page 21, Dr. Masterson does concede that  the risk for injury is known to be 
lowered by having one’s head turned, fl exed forward, and by being unaware of 
the impending crash, but then dismisses th ese risk magnifiers as “small,” citing, 
interestingly enough, Kornhauser (footnote 39, page 21). But Kornhauser’s paper 
is actually a purely theoretic al one that does not offer any research-based evidence 
for these risk factors. Instead, he di scusses bumper ratings in terms of the 
potential crash speeds which might occur without resulting damage, based on the relative vehicle masses and th e types of bumpers they each have. If Dr. Masterson 
were fully aware of the content of this  paper, perhaps it might have tempered 
some of his comments regarding the NR MA crash tests, since Kornhauser’s 
conclusions would have rendered Dr. Mast erson’s earlier comme nts moot at best. 
On the other hand, Ryan et al. (22) has reported that the risk of developing long-
term whiplash was increased by a factor  of 15 (1500%), which would hardly be 
characterized as small. Ono et al. (55) reported the increased excursions that would occur with a head forward positi on. In fact, with the head forward, the 
backset (the distance between the head and the head restraint) is increased to the 
point of nullifying any protection offered by the device. It is al so noteworthy that 
one of the most important current goals of the scientific whiplash community is the development, adoption, and implementation of a neck injury criterion (NIC). This work focuses to a large extent on th e differential head and neck velocity and 
Mr. Stephen Harvey 
Page 12 of 19 
 
 
acceleration, and the single largest factor affecting that variable is backset (56). 
Again, hardly a small issue. 
17. On page 21, Dr. Masterson offers his opinions regarding the additional risk imposed by crash #2. He dismisses it as  unimportant. Notably here, he has no 
police report, no witness statements, no repair estimates, and no formal reconstruction of the crash from which to base this opinion. No r has he considered 
another important risk factor  here: prior injury (57). 
18. On page 22, Dr. Masterson estimates the de lta V of crash #1 at well below 5 km/h 
and less than 3 g. His methodology or logic for arriving at these numbers is not 
offered, but based on the experience of thos e of us in the cras h testing community, 
estimates such as this are simply not po ssible without a crysta l ball. Most modern 
passenger cars will withstand a closing ve locity of 13-19 km/h or more without 
sustaining structural property damage. Below that speed, in the absence of having some tangible evidence to base a more qualified opinion on, crash speed estimation is pure speculation. And, as noted above, it would appear that the crash 
speed might well have been closer to 19 or 20 km/h. I hasten to add, that we 
generally have not produced the type of damage descri bed in these records in 
crashes at under 6 km/h, although we do not  attempt oblique rear impacts because 
they would pose too much risk to be conducted ethically with human subjects. 
19. On page 22 Dr. Masterson also makes additional comments (sans reference to 
scientific literature) suggesting that soft  tissue injuries are benign and the natural 
history is essentially favorable. Having st udied this subject in  great detail, I can 
categorically state that quite the opposite is the case. In the past 50 years, there have been about 60 outcome studies (for convenience I re fer the reader to table 8-
14 on page 408 of my textbook Whiplash Injuries: the Cervical 
Acceleration/Deceleration Syndrome , 3
rd edition, 2001). Taken as an aggregate, 
these studies show that the risk for de veloping long-term symptoms, once injured, 
are from 35-58%, which would hardly be considered benign, nor would the outcome be described as favorable. 
 
 
Executive Summary of the Report of Dr. Masterson 
 
1. In my experience and based on our own research with observer studies, Ms. 
Tanker’s very precise observations and cl ear recollections of the details of the 
crash should be viewed w ith some caution. Generally, these cannot be considered 
unbiased and she was clearly not paying su fficient attention at the time to avoid 
the collision. Yet these details form th e entire foundation for his opinions for both 
crashes, as noted earlier, except in cer tain instances where Dr. Masterson has 
chosen to disregard these details (see above under #12).  
2. There was no formal reconstruction of either crash. All of Dr. Masterson’s 
conjectures regarding crash metrics (i.e ., delta V, acceleration levels) are not 
much more reliable than guesses and c ould easily be off by up to 300% based on 
actual crash test studies and large epidemiological field e xperience as reported in 
the literature. At  my institute we have conducted numerous crash tests in which 
Mr. Stephen Harvey 
Page 13 of 19 
 
 
the resulting damage to bumpers was as de scribed in these two cases and we have 
reported injuries resulting from these cr ashes, despite havi ng screened subjects 
beforehand to eliminate those at specia l risk, and despite providing a very 
controlled, low-risk laborato ry environment, and despit e the subjects’ awareness 
of their participation in th e crash tests. In our studie s, we have found that even 
from one nearly identical crash test to the next, the occupant’s kinematic 
responses and head linear accelerations can very widely. There are many variables that can never be accounted for, particular ly in real-world crashes. And, in real-
world reconstructed rear end crash studi es, the largest inju ry group reported was 
the no-damage group (44). It is well known that a substa ntial proportion of 
whiplash injuries occur with minimal or  zero-damage crashes (34) and, further, 
that crash damage assessment is not correla ted with acute injury risk (46-50) or 
outcome (12,22,51-53) in the lower ranges of crash speeds. Most recently, a 
Japanese study confirmed the lack of co rrelation between either  injury risk or 
duration of symptoms and property damage (58). It is entirely possible to be 
injured in the crashes as described in these records of Dr. Masterson. 
3. Although I have not examined the medical record, based on Dr. Masterson’s 
summaries, and considering the risk factor s present in both crashes, the injuries 
claimed by Mr. Harvey are commonly seen  clinically, are consistent with the 
biomechanics of an oblique crash and a head-turned and flexed position, and are certainly plausible. The noti ons Dr. Masterson holds of to lerance to injury are not 
supported by any valid epidemiological or experimental studies and are, in fact, 
contrary to the balance of the literat ure. A team of epidemiologists and 
biostatisticians (including myself) have formally dispelled this myth in the peer-reviewed, medical literature in the past  (59). Using the la nguage of science, 
statistics, and epidemiology, we made tw o unambiguous points in this regard: (a) 
none of the human subject crash test st udies published to date—including our 
own—can be used to determine human tolera nce or safety boundaries for injury in 
low speed crash tests. This is never th e purpose of this kind of work. To do so 
scientifically, by applying statistical significance tests, would require a completely different approach which w ould necessitate a prohibitively large 
number of crashes under a broad range of representative crash conditions, and would need to include subjects of  both sex, possessing various physical 
conditions, and we would need to have a broad age stratification among them all. 
Moreover, it would require the use of numerous known ri sk factors, such as the 
head turned position and non-awareness, which would not be possible for both 
practical and ethical reasons; additionall y, we would need to gradually increase 
the crash speeds until in juries occurred, in order to delineate the injury boundary, 
and this would clearly constitute a violation of the Helsinki Doctrine; and (b) even in the fairly low level accelerations found in amusement park rides, although they 
are rare, we found that even severe in juries (including spinal fracture and 
tetraplegia) can occur (50,59). Thus, it is simply not possible to extrapolate from 
these highly controlled, limited number, non- representative crash tests, or a small 
number of amusement park rides, to the re al world of automobile crashes. It also 
appears to be a consistent fact in this case that Mr. Harvey had at least five known 
Mr. Stephen Harvey 
Page 14 of 19 
 
 
significant risk factors, which have all b een established in the world literature: a 
prior history of headache (25), a head-t urned position (12-14 ), non-awareness of 
the impending crash (21-24), and an out-o f-position-occupant condition (15-21), 
and, in the case of the second crash, prior injury (60). Although it not possible to 
quantify the incremental increases in risk attributable to each of these factors, 
neither is it possible to discount them out  of hand, as Dr. Masterson has. Most 
importantly, while Dr. Masterson subscribes  to this theoretical risk threshold on 
the basis of crash speed (which, in truth, does not exist), he does not appear to 
consider that such a threshold would probably be markedly lowered in the 
presence of these risk factors. I hast en to add that, although I have described 
several specific known risk factors whic h would serve to lo wer this putative 
threshold of harmlessness alluded to earlier, there may be other risk factors in this case that I am as yet unaware of, havi ng not reviewed the full medical record. 
4. Dr. Masterson’s reliance on the report of  Allen et al. (42) is particularly 
concerning. This paper, which has been shown to suffer from numerous design 
flaws and erroneous conclusions, has been widely discredited in this field of 
science (43) and is generally viewed with embarrassment by the scientific community and the editors of Spine , a journal which published it (and of which I 
am a manuscript reviewe r), although it remains popular among those experts 
wishing to falsely portray whiplash injuries as trivial.  I have noted above that, in 
other sections, Dr. Masterson misreprese nts the findings of other studies and 
generally ignores a larger body of evidence that would contradi ct his hypotheses. 
5. Dr. Masterson did not consider a compre hensive risk assessment. He did make 
note of a few known risk variables in his summary, but then dismissed them as “small,” without providing any rationale for doing so. This is in contravention to 
current thought, however, and would re quire some formal rationale on Dr. 
Masterson’s part, I would think, before we  could take this dismissal seriously. 
6. Apart from calling attention to numerous nuances in the minor details of the 
history provided to the numerous health  care providers (the  subtext of which 
appears to be to suggest th at Mr. Harvey is fabricati ng or embellishing his story), 
Dr. Masterson has largely rejected the ex isting medical record in this case—save 
for a few comments, including some po ssible psychological problems—virtually 
out of hand. This privilege he appears to have accorded himself by his rather dubious crash metric and clea rly incorrect injury thre shold beliefs. The logic 
appears to be simply that because he has demonstrated that injury was simply not possible in these two crashes, all of th e subsequent medical treatment rendered 
was unnecessary; all of the specialists’ medical opinions erroneous. In truth, having neither interviewed nor examined Mr. Harvey, and by rejecting most of 
the medical record and opinions of nume rous other specialists, and further by 
relying entirely on a non-valid crash a ssessment methods and non-existent injury 
thresholds, Dr. Masterson’s conclusions offer little in the way of probative value 
one way or the other and, in my view, it is  his report that should be rejected. As 
an epidemiologist, orthopaedist, and as a crash test researcher, I find it difficult to agree with just about any of his theories. 
Mr. Stephen Harvey

7. In summary, and with all due respect to Dr. Masterson, his opinions in this case 
contradict or contravene the balance of the clinical a nd epidemiological literature, 
are rather egregiously and sc ientifically baseless, logica lly untenable, and, in my 
humble opinion, offer no service to the courts in this instance.  
 
 
In the future, I may review additional medical records as provided to me by the plaintiff 
or his counsel and may provide an  addendum report to this one.  
 
 
Sincerely,

RE: MINOR, Stephen 
 
Dear Mr. Hargrave: 
 
This is my assessment of your client, Mr . Stephen Minor, concerning his cumulative 
exposures while working for the railroad. 
 
 
Qualifications 
 
I am the director and founder of the Spine Re search Institute of San Diego. I have been 
actively engaged in whiplash research for the past 20 years and have co-authored a 
textbook on whiplash ( Whiplash Injuries: the Cervical Acceleration/Deceleration 
Syndrome , third edition, 2001 ) and on temporomandibular disorders ( Whiplash and 
Temporomandibular Disorders: an Interd isciplinary Approach to Case Management ) 
along with several other books, textbook chapters, and over 2 50 professional papers. I 
was the developer of the now widely used whiplash grading system (aka the Quebec Task 
Force Grading system or the WAD Grading system), as well as widely adopted treatment guidelines. I have conducted full scale human vol unteer crash test resear ch at my institute 
since 1999, the results of which have been disseminated throughout the U.S. and in 
Europe.  
 
I am board certified in orthopaedics (Ameri can Board of Chiropractic Orthopaedists) and 
forensic medicine (American Board of Forensic  Medicine). I serve on the editorial boards 
of several professional peer-reviewed chir opractic, medical, and engineering journals,

Interview With Mr. Stephen Minor, October 9, 2002. 
 
On October 9, 2002, I interviewed Mr. Stephen Minor in Sacramento, California. This 
interview lasted approximately four hours. Hi s medical history is significant for asthma 
as a child which resolved at around the age of 14 or 15 years. This curtailed his activities 
as a child and he did not part icipate in sports as a result . He underwent appendectomy as 
an infant. He has had two arthroscopic surg eries to his knees, one in the 1970s for an 
injury sustained getting off the couch and th e other more recently which he sustained 
while working on the locomotive. He explained that in the early dawn hours he tripped on 
a flag stick, fell, and wrenched his knee.  This occurred in the past few years. 
 
In the 1960s he had a cyst removed from below his left breast. It was found to be benign. 
He has been taking Zestril for hypertension fo r a year or so. He also takes a daily 
antiinflammatory medication, Bextra, uses Temazepam for help with sleep on an as

needed basis, and takes Norco for pain, also on an as needed basis. Currently he reports taking 1-4 daily and took one during my interview with him. 
 
At age 13 or 14 years Mr Minor was riding his bicycle, fell off, and hit his head. He reported being disoriented, but does not believe he lost consciousness. He apparently rode 
the bike home and was later taken to th e hospital where he was diagnosed with a 
concussion and had an overnight stay. He denies  any residual cognitive  or other problems 
from that incident. 
 
In approximately 1995 Mr. Minor was driving his Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck and 
fell asleep at the wheel. The vehicle then left the roadway and collided in the 12:00 
o’clock position with a telephone pole, pushing the truck’s bumper 2-3 ft back into the 
engine compartment. The truck was totaled by the insurance company. Mr. Minor stated 
that he was wearing his seat  belt and shoulder harness (the truck was not equipped with 
air bags). He does not recall th e details of the crash, but re calls someone helping him out 
of the vehicle. He was later seen by a Dr. C ohen who treated him for minor lacerations to 
his knees and ordered a CT or MR I scan of the head to rule out brain injury. The basis for 
the concern was apparently Mr. Minor’s difficulty recalling th e names of past presidents 
of the U.S. The CT or MRI was reportedl y normal. Mr. Minor de nies sustaining any 
neck, back, or other extremity injuries in  the crash and did not have any further 
diagnostic tests or treatment after his visit with Dr. C ohen. He denied any residual 
problems from the crash. 
 
Work Injury History   Mr. Minor worked for the railroad from August of 1968 to 
November of 2000. During that time he has ha d the knee injury and subsequent surgery 
noted above and a few episodes of metal splinters  in his eyes. He has not had any back or 
neck injuries or significant episodes of back or neck pain prior to the summer of 2000. He 
also lacerated his right hand on a broken card holder when he tripped. This required a few 
sutures. It occurred on the job in the 1990s. In about 1972 he reported that he was 
backing up the train, leaning out of the window  and waiting for a signal. The signal didn’t 
come and he slammed into some other cars, causing him to strike his face into the window frame, lacerating his lip. He did not ha ve any neck or back pain following that 
incident. 
 
He worked as a fireman until 1972. He hostled fo r about 2 years also. Most of his career 
of 32 year years has been spent as an engi neer. The average time he spent on the tracks 
was reported to be 8 hours.  
 
History of Present Illness   Mr. Minor reported that in approximately August of 2000 he 
began to notice suboccipital area headaches , which became progressively more intense 
toward the end of his shift. These were associat ed with posterior neck pain at the base of 
his neck. He then developed low back pain. Mo st of the spinal pain was described as dull 
during this period. He also noted that th ese symptoms became progressively more 
troublesome over the next several months and he began to develop numbness in his upper 
extremity—also toward the end of a shift.  The numbness was the last symptom to 
develop and only occurred in the presence of neck pain. He described the pain he was 
MINOR, Stephen 
Page 4 of 13 
 
having at that time as 2/ 10 usually, becoming up to 4/10 by the end of a work day. 
Towards October, 2000 the pain became prominen t within 2-3 hours of starting his shift. 
He began to self-medicate, using ibuprofe n, and by October was taking up to 12 200 mg 
tablets daily and was concerned th at it might damage his liver.  
 
Over the summer and through the fall his cond ition gradually worsened, such that he 
would awaken with neck and low back stiffness every day, although this would lessen on days he was not working. However, ev en home activities such as cooking could 
exacerbate his symptoms. As a result of the progressive nature of his neck, back, and 
upper extremity symptoms, he sought the ad vice of William Duff y, MD. This was in 
October of 2000. Dr. Duffy ordered an MRI of  the cervical and lumbar spines. These 
showed abnormalities which prompted Dr. Duffy to recommend Mr. Minor not return to work as an engineer. Mr. Minor has not worked since that time (November 2000). 
 
Dr. Duffy also sent Mr. Minor for a series of epidural ster oid injections to his cervical 
and lumbar spines. These were performed by Stephen K. Parkinson, MD. Mr. Minor was 
also seen by Jerome A. Schofferman, MD a nd Victor Katz, MD at the SpineCare Medical 
Group in Daly City beginning in February of  2002. He was later seen at the same center 
by Robert Salava, MD in July of 2002 for a se ries of anesthetic and steroid blocks.  
 
Mr. Minor reported having generally good succes s with the epidural injections he 
received, although his back and neck pain never fully resolved. On Memorial Day 
weekend of 2002 he was getting out of a truck and felt a sensation he initially perceived 
as a “muscle pull.” He went to his regularly scheduled therapy session. However, by the next day his low back pain and leg pain were so severe that he asked his wife to drive 
him to the hospital. This was attempted but the drive was intolerable and they returned home. He described the low back pain as 4-5/ 10 and the leg pain as 10/10. His wife went 
in to Dr. Duffy’s office and he provided her with a prescription fo r morphine, which she 
filled for Mr. Minor. He was then confined to bed for about three weeks, complaining 
that he only got up to use the bathroom and that even that was very difficult. 
 
A subsequent MRI of the lumbar spine reveal ed a progression of the degenerative L3-4 
disc and Mr. Minor subsequently underwent additional epidural injections, as well as diagnostic injections into the sacroiliac joints and the left trochanter ic bursa to rule out 
those areas as causing or contributing to hi s left thigh pain. (N ote that this L3-4 
degenerative condition was not initially described, but was noted in a retrospective reading by Dr. Schofferman.) The SI and troc hanteric injections were performed by Dr. 
Salava. Mr. Minor did experience some relief at that time, so  Dr. Salava decided not to 
perform the additional lumbar epi dural injection at that time.  
 
At the suggestion of Dr. Schofferman, Mr. Mi nor did get physical th erapy for his neck 
and low back. This consisted of heat, musc le stimulation, and massage for the neck. He 
told me this therapy did help him. He was being seen at a frequency of two times per 
week. On Memorial Day, when his low back  pain/leg pain aggravation occurred, he 
discontinued physical therapy. 
 
MINOR, Stephen 
Page 5 of 13 
 
He has now returned to physical therapy—this time directed at the low back. He first was 
seen about two weeks ago. Therapy consists of squatting exercises against the wall, 
exercises aimed at strengthening the back, and some therapy modalities such as ultrasound.  
 
At the present time, no decision has been made  regarding the need for surgery. Currently 
he complains of daily neck pain at the base of his neck primarily and, secondarily, in the 
suboccipital region. This pain is 1/10 beco ming 2/10 and he gets occasional (1-3/day) 
severe, but brief, episodes of sharp neck pa in (“zingers”) which are sometimes associated 
with radiation into his left arm, forearm, and first and second digits. He has had good results with the epidural injections he’s had, but feels that his neck symptoms are 
beginning to increase. This pain is exacer bated by having his arms high on a couch 
bolster or by doing overhead work such as chan ging a light bulb. He ha s been told not to 
lift more than 10 lb. 
 
Most of his low back pain is centered over the midline from about L3 to L4. He has some radiation into the left gluteal  region and across the left troc hanter and down the anterior 
thigh. It then splits, going around the medial and lateral aspect of  the knee and does not 
radiate below the knee. (He has had right thigh pain also, but  does not have that problem 
now.) This low back and leg pain are exacerba ted by sitting or standing for more than 1-
1.5 hours. It is partially relieved by taking medi cations, sitting in a hot tub, and walking. 
If sitting is painful he stands up. If standing is painful, he sits down. Several times during 
my discussion with him he rose and moved around the office and complained twice of 
feeling “zingers” in his neck. The low back pain is constant and 2-3/10 now. The leg 
pain, which was greatly relieved  by epidural steroid injections , is now starting to return 
and is currently rated by him a 1/10 a nd is occasional in frequency (30%).  
 
Job Description   I asked Mr. Minor about his job as an engineer and, specifically, what 
types of forces and/or stresses he experienced on the job over his 32 years of employment 
with the railroad. He related to me that he  was exposed to lateral motion over areas of 
loose track and over “frogs.” He told me that in some instances he would have to stand up 
in order to prevent being thrown out of his seat. In other instances, over light rail on the 
local branch lines, there are soft spots under the rail where the ballast has not been well 
maintained and this causes a rhythmic rolling of the engine which al so causes a lot of 
lateral rolling motion. This is worse at lower speeds than at higher speeds.  
 
He also described occasions where “slack ac tion” resulted in ra ther sharp bumps of 
acceleration to the train. These o ccurred at a frequency of about three events out of five 
runs. It also happened when he was told to st op abruptly. Usually, he could hear the event 
coming as the slack was taken in. In severe cases they can throw you out of the seat, but 
usually result in a whiplash-like jolt. Duri ng the last two years of his employment with 
the railroad, he worked out of the Sacramen to Yard on jobs such as the Proctor and 
Gamble, where he regularly kick ed cars. This practice can resu lt in significant anterior to 
posterior neck motion as a result of the slack being taken up between cars during the 
process and can be aggravated in instances  where there are partially filled tank cars 
without baffles, due to the sloshing back and forth of the liquid in the tanks. During a 
MINOR, Stephen 
Page 6 of 13 
 
shift he might repeat this kicking process 40-50 times. Another prac tice he described was 
“dropping cars.” This is done to move cars around. The engineer stretches the cars out, 
then slams on the brakes, a pin is pulled a nd the engine leaves th e cars. This can also 
result in a whiplash-type motion to the neck. He  informed me that if the seat is good, this 
is fairly tolerable, but usually  the seat pedestal is loose re sulting in seat wobble, making 
the experience less tolerable. 
 
Mr. Minor’s primary complaint is in the loose fitting seats he  was required to sit in during 
his shift. This resulted in seat wobble whic h was physically hard to  tolerate, especially 
during the side-to-side motions over areas of loose track. Most of the seats he used wobbled to one degree or another, although he  could occasionally swap one for a better 
one. 
 
Mr. Minor gave what appeared to be a stra ight forward accounting of his medical history 
and his current complaints and treatment to date. He was imperfect on some dates, such as his knee surgeries, but information provide d to me at this interview was generally

William P. Duffy, MD   There is a report of a lumbar and cervical spine MRI dated 10-
27-00. At C5-6 there is a small left paracentr al disc protrusion which mildly narrows the 
left neural foramen. Mild anular bulging is seen at C6-7, without focal protrusion. In the 
lumbar region, degenerative changes are noted at L4-5, with early changes also in the 
facet joints at that level. No disc protrusion is noted. 
 
Several progress reports note th at Mr. Minor is disabled fr om 10-6-00 through at least 4-
5-01. Dr. Duffy, in a report of 4-9-01, reports  limitation of motion in the neck with 
normal neurological findings. 
 
In a second MRI of the lumbar spine, date d 6-12-02, and read by David J. Seidenwurm, 
MD, there is a left lateral disc protrusion at L3-4 with displacement of the L3 nerve root 
in the foramen. 
 
 
Michael W. Cohen, MD   In a report dated 11-28-00, he  finds an absent right ankle 
reflex, but recommends Mr. Mi nor return to his job as an  engineer. He was examining 
Mr. Minor for the railroad. He did not see the MRI studies of 10-27-00. 
 
 
Stephen K. Parkinson, MD   Records indicate multiple epidural steroid injections were 
given to Mr. Minor—both cervical an d lumbar—between 11-3-00 and 8-1-02. 
 
 
MINOR, Stephen

Jerome A. Schofferman, MD and Victor Katz, MD   In their consultation/examination 
of  Mr. Minor on 2-26-02 they reported nor mal deep tendon reflexes and some loss of 
cervical spine range of motion. There was some mildly diminished sensitivity in the left C6 dermatome. They did not observe any distur bances in affect or pain behavior. They 
reviewed the original MRIs a nd diagnosed HNP at C5-6, cerv ical disc disease at C5-6 
and C7, and lumbar degenerative disease at L4-5. There was a sugge stion that cervical 
spine surgery might be appropriate depending on the success of less invasive procedures. They recommended physical therapy, directed at  the lumbar spine. However, there is also 
a physical therapy slip in this  set of records in which both lumbar and cervical therapy 
were prescribed.  
 
On 7-3-02 there are records of Mr. Minor’s lo w back pain/leg pain aggravation. A repeat 
MRI was obtained and the new diagnosis, ba sed on the new findings on MRI, was L3-4 
left lateral disc herniation with left si ded L3 radiculopathy. Dr. Schofferman also 
diagnosed a left greater trocha nteric bursitis and a possible left SI joint dysfunction. He 
recommended injections to treat/diagnose these conditions. Dr. Salava performed these injections.  On 8-23-02 Mr. Minor was seen there again after having obtained a lumbar 
epidural steroid injection from Dr. Parkin son. Physical therapy was again recommended. 
The trochanteric and SI in jections results were not thought to be “dramatic.” 
 
 
Eugene J. Carragee, MD   On 12-3-01 Mr Minor was seen  by Dr. Carragee at the behest 
of Mr. Donald C. Sinclaire II. According to Dr. Carragee, at the time of his examination 
of Mr. Minor, Minor was not complaining of any extremity pain and reported back pain as more severe than the neck pain. Both were  recorded as 2-3/10, with the low back pain 
becoming 5/10 towards the end of the day and occasionally as high as 7/10. He found limitation of motion in the neck, but no neurol ogical symptoms.  He also reported an 
enlarged liver and four positive Waddell’s signs. (Waddell’s signs are thought to be indicators of non-organic disorders. However, not all of them are universally regarded as valid indicators because they require a s ubjective interpretation  of the examining 
physician and they have been poorly validated  in peer reviewed medical literature.) 
Conversely, the more generally accepted Oswest ry score was reported to be 50, which is 
consistent with what the originators of the Oswestry instrument termed “moderate 
disability.” Interestingly, Dr. Carragee th en commented that he does not understand Mr. 
Minor’s severe activity and wo rk restrictions, apparently placing more faith in the 
Waddell tests than the Oswestry. He did not see the MRI studies a nd apparently did not 
explore a job analysis vis-à- vis the disability issues. 
 
 
Declarations and Other Reports 
 
 
Declaration of David Wilder, PhD   In his declaration, Dr. Wilder describes his 
experiences riding in locomotive cabs. The s eats wobbled and tipped both fore and aft 
and side to side. He discusse d his research in the effects of vibration. He believes that 
asymmetric loading can injure discs and that  muscles are not often able to protect the 
MINOR, Stephen 
Page 8 of 13 
 
back and trunk against impact and vibration. The effects of prolonged vibration include 
fatigue of muscles. The so-called “wobbliness” of the seats on the locomotives, in his opinion, was a significant contribut ing factor to the causation of  cumulative spine injuries 
in Mr. Minor.  
 
 
Declaration of William H. Muzzy  Mr. Muzzy conducted an inspection of locomotives in the Roseville, California yard on November 30, 1999. I was also present at that inspection. He used an inclinometer to measur e the wobble of the seats in these engines. 
He reported several degrees of freedom as a re sult of the available motion in these seats. 
He also reported that one of  the seats had foam padding that was very worn and that 
would not support a man’s weight. He noted fore  and aft and side to side motion in these 
seats and noted that in other industries in which workers are exposed to vibration, seats do not wobble. There was little evidence of maintenance and he felt that the seats were 
unsafe. 
 
 
Declaration of Willia m R. Bogett, PhD, PE   Dr. Bogett, who worked for General 
Motors Corporation at their Electo-Motive Di vision, reported that locomotive cab seats 
that are in proper condition do not deflect appreciab ly in either the fore and aft or side to 
side directions. This is likely  to occur as a result of wear or mismatch, he wrote.  
 
 
Report of Eckardt Johanning, MD, MSc titled “Whole body vibration exposure measurement and seat ergonomic asse ssment. SW 1500 EMD Yard Switching 
Locomotives.”  Dr. Johanning measured the whole-body vibration exposure on the engineer’s seat and its mounting points on two UP yard switching locomotives and 
reported that the horizontal (x,y) vibrations we re relatively high and fr equent and that the 
ISO standards concerning crest factors was of ten exceeded, leading to an increased risk 
for exposure to vibration and postural stress. 
 
 
Report of Eckardt Johanning, MD, MSc titled “Whole body vibration exposure 
measurement: GP-40 UP Locomotive.”  Dr. Johanning measured the whole-body 
vibration exposure on the e ngineer’s seat and its mounting points on a GP40-2 
locomotive and reported that the horizontal (x,y) vibrations were relatively high and 
frequent and that the ISO standards concer ning crest factors was often exceeded. The 
seats tested included the engine ers, fireman’s, and conductor’s . It was reported that the 
seats were inadequate to sufficiently minimi ze vibration exposure and protect the seated 
operator from vibration a nd other ergonomic stressors. 
 
 
Report from Jack F. Wasserman, PhD, PE titled “Evaluation of locomotive rides 
during switchyard usage.”   Dr. Wasserman conducted tests on locomotive SP2618 on 
May 24, 1999.  He instrumented two seats with  accelerometers, and reported that the 
crest factors exceeded the allowable standard. He concluded that the railroad should have 
MINOR, Stephen 
Page 9 of 13 
 
recognized the potential for injury of engineers in the railroad sw itching yards and also 
that other approaches that would allow fo r the engineer to be warned of impending 
collisions might have been implemented. He also noted that posture assumed during the 
course of work and the unexpected nature of some impacts contribute to injury risk. 
 
 
Declaration of Neil K. Cooperrider, PhD, PE   Dr. Cooperrider, w ho has expertise in 
trains and transportation systems, measured the vibration and impacts on four different 
runs in the year 2000. He also examined the se ats of the locomotives. He reported that the 
seats were securely attached and reasonabl y safe. He did note some angular play or 
wobble, however. Measurements and exposures, obtained by what he reported to be ISO-
conformant methodology, were described only as “benign.” He did not discuss crest 
factors. He also reported measuring the im pact environment experienced by crewmen in 
the yard and local switchyard operations on three locomotives and reported that the 
results of all of the measured impacts (in te rms of change in velo city) were very mild 
compared to the injury thres holds reported in peer-reviewed literature. For this he cited 
McConnell et al. (1). Dr. C ooperrider reported longitudinal accelerations of up to 1.84 g 
and changes of velocity of up to 1.75 mph, again comparing these favorably to the 
literature (1). 
 
Dr. Cooperrider was critical of  some of the comments or  opinions expressed by Mr. 
Muzzy, and Drs. Bogett and Wilder in their declarations. For example, no “hard stops” 
were encountered, as described by Dr. Wilder, and he referred to Dr. Wilder’s 
“theoretical construct” regarding injury m echanisms. Dr. Wilder, he pointed out, did not 
cite specific frequency, intensit y, and duration in terms of th eir effect on adverse health 
outcomes. Similarly, he criticized Mr. Muzzy ’s report for lacking objective data to 
support his conclusions on the basis of the pl aintiff’s exposure to w hole body vibration or 
impact, and for not citing scientific data or literature to support the proposition that seat 
wobble would increase the risk for back injury. He reported that he (Cooperrider) is not 
aware of any scientific evidence that seat padding deficiencies might  also pose a health 
risk in terms of injury. 
 
Dr. Cooperrider’s opinions lack some degree of  logical and scientific  underpinning. He is 
no doubt aware that the issue in  this case is not a single cr ash event, but years of  
cumulative trauma which resulted in Mr. Mino r (Mr. Aiken in the case he was discussing 
in the declaration) becoming disabled. Yet the “thresholds reported to cause injury in the 
literature” he cited were McC onnell et al. (1) and these were for single impact exposures 
to rear impact automobile collisions at low speeds. The McConnell et al. study does not 
serve, incidentally, as a valid threshold for injury to real world persons exposed to these 
crashes because the study lacked external va lidity for reasons whic h my colleagues and I 
have discussed elsewhere (2). To suggest that  this study might serve as a valid threshold 
for long-term exposures to the impacts expe rienced by engineers in  locomotives, as well 
as to other vibrations which are unique to tr ains, is an extrapolation that is dubious at 
best.  
 
MINOR, Stephen 
Page 10 of 13 
 
The logical flaw in Dr. Cooperride r’s conclusion is similar to th at of the authors he cites. 
They reported only a small number of crash te sts, using a small number of subjects. The 
fact that some of the subjects suffered only mi nor injuries not requir ing treatment, cannot 
be used to gauge risk for all motorists in all cr ashes, nor can it be used to establish a safe 
threshold below which no risk for injury exis ts. The small number of tests did not allow 
them to apply statistical methods. In fact, more  recent studies have reported the risk to be 
half the magnitude of what McConnell et al reported (3). Likewise, since he sampled only 
four individual runs, Dr. Cooperrider cannot state with any sta tistical confidence that he 
measured any peaks of speed change or accele ration which correlate with the relatively 
frequent jolts described by Mr . Minor and other engineers. From my own experience with 
motor vehicle crash testing, a jolt sufficient to dislodge a grown man from his seat or 
snap his head back and forth as described by Mr. Minor would be associated with much 
higher accelerations than those reported by Dr. Cooperrider.  
 
It is also noteworthy that the literature shows that a large pr oportion of persons injured in 
whiplash trauma do not have immediate symptoms. Symptoms are often delayed 24-72 
hours (4-6) yet also are often permanent (6-8). Thus, significant injuries ca n occur to the 
spinal structures that are not immediately apparent to the vict im. It follows from this that 
loads of a lesser severity, such as the slack  actions and lateral motions induced by loose 
track and experienced by engine ers during the course of thei r work, might similarly cause 
some degree of microstructural damage to di scs and other spinal structures which might 
only become manifest years later. This is th e concept of cumulative trauma and it is my 
opinion that over the course of 32 years, the cumulative effects of the whole body 
vibration, in concert with the frequent jolt s of acceleration occurring during unexpected 
and violent slack action—both of which are accentuated by seat wobble—have resulted 
in the degenerative disc disease found in Mr. Minor’s cervical and lumbar spines, and in the subsequent disc herniation in the lumbar spine. 
 
I would also point out that s ubjects in rear impact crash te sts generally experience much 
higher amplitudes of acceleration than the vehi cle in which they are riding. This is the 
result of their interaction with the seat b ack. Being out of position (i.e., leaning forward) 
will result in a more violent interaction with the seat back. Seat backs also contribute to 
the subject’s forward motion af ter initial impact as a result of their coefficient of 
restitution. Seat wobble will conf ound this reaction, placing the s ubject at greater risk for 
injury.  
 
 
Conclusions and Opinions 
 
It is my opinion that, over the course of 32 years, the cumulative effects of the whole 
body vibration, in concert with the frequent  jolts of acceleration occurring during 
unexpected and violent slack action—both of  which are accentuated by seat wobble—
have resulted in the degenerative disc dis ease found in Mr. Minor’s  cervical and lumbar 
spines, and in the subsequent disc herniation in the lumbar spine. This condition became 
symptomatic in about August of 2000 and became progressively more severe over the next several months. Mr. Minor attempted to self-medicate, but this progression in terms 
MINOR, Stephen 
Page 11 of 13 
 
of frequency and severity eventually caused him to seek medical attention. This condition 
is the reason for his current disability a nd need for medical care. His later lumbar 
herniation in the summer of 2002 is a result of this degenerative change and thus is 
related directly to his long-term exposure to vibration and shocks as an engineer. 
 
I do not expect, based on my clinical experien ce and training, and based on my review of 
the medical records, that Mr. Minor will be able to return to work in his previous role as 
an engineer. 
 
 
Reasons For Conclusions and Opinions 
 
Disc herniation is generally regarded as being preceded by degenerative disease (9). 
Thus, the herniation sustained during the ye ar 2002 had, as its proximate cause, Mr. 
Minor’s 32 years of industrial exposure and resulting degenerative disc disease. It has been shown that the spine is vulnerable to repetitive loading in an asymmetric posture, 
such as a driver’s, and is more susceptible to sudden unexpected loading as would occur 
in the locomotive seat under adverse conditions of slack action (10). This would be 
compounded by a wobbling seat that fails to  provide support under these conditions on 
the basis of findings in out-of-position occ upant studies (11,12) and my observations 
during human subject crash tests. Other studie s have demonstrated that under prolonged 
exposure to vibration, muscles become fatigue d and this makes workers who are subject 
to such vibrations vulnerable to disc di sruption (9). Again, a wobbling seat platform 
would increase the work of the trunk musculature, exacerbating this effect. 
 
In the cervical spine, it has been demonstrat ed that exposure to acute whiplash trauma 
increases the risk for cervical disc degenera tion in ensuing years (13). It has also been 
reported that retired professional soccer play ers have degenerative changes in their necks 
to a greater degree than age- and sex-matc hed non-soccer players, owing to their long-
term exposure to minor trauma to the spine which is not associated with any specific acute injuries (14). This is anot her example of cumulative trauma.  
 
It is also known that persons exposed to whip lash impacts at a time that they are unaware 
of the impending impact, are more likely to suffer long-term symptoms (15,16). It 
follows that the impacts occurring during lo comotive operation, which are described as 
occasionally occurring without warning, woul d similarly be more hazardous. Impacts 
occurring when the head is turned result in asymmetric loading of the discs, spinal ligaments, and facet joints in the neck and have also been shown to increase the risk for injury (17). 
 
When the seat wobbles, there is likely to be minor repetitive side to side rocking and fore 
and aft rocking over a long period of time. This repetitive motion has recently been 
shown to be associated with disc herniation in an animal model (18). This occurs even 
under modest forces when sufficient loading cycles are applied. 
 
MINOR, Stephen 
Page 12 of 13 
 
On two occasions I inspected locomotives  and the seats found in them. One such 
occasion was with Mr. Muzzy as noted earlier. As he reported, the seats were generally able to wobble quite a bit and would not ha ve provided a secure seating position for the 
engineer. This was the case with all the s eats I inspected. From discussions with Mr. 
Minor, this is the general condi tion of the vast majority of the seats he was required to 
use. 
 
The medical record is consistent with degene rative disc disease and a subsequent lumbar 
disc herniation for which there is no othe r reported precedent trauma aside from the 
motor vehicle crash which occurred in about 1995. It is unlikely that  that event had any 
significant effect on the lumbar spinal de generation which would have occurred over 
many years’ time and would have been present even at that time. Instead, it may have acted as another event in the long line of cumulative trauma sustained in the course of 
Mr. Minor’s 32 years on the railroad. It is noteworthy that high speed crashes such as the 
this occur over a longer crash duration than lower speed collisions such as whiplash and 
are generally relatively less injurious as a re sult, because the subject can ride down the 
crash over a longer time. (Mr. Minor reported no injuries from that experience other than 
lacerations to his knees.) This explains why a large proportion of whiplash injuries to the 
neck and back occur with minimal or no property damage (19). 
 
 
Anticipated Addi tional Reports   It is my understanding that I am to be furnished with 
additional reports to review including t hose of Drs. Bogett, Wasserman, Johanning, 
Krause, and William Muzzy and James Lurier. After reviewing those reports I will prepare a supplemental report.

Pertinent Review 
 
Dr. Traffica a past medical hi story of testicular cancer for which he was treated and 
which is currently in remission. He takes Talw in on a regular basis for chronic abdominal 
pain related to this treatment. He also was involved in a MVC in 1969 in which he 
sustained no significant injury. 
 
Dr. Traffica claims that on 1-11-1996 he wa s driving his Ford Bronco and had stopped in 
a parking lot. He was bent forward in his seat and was twisting his body and his neck to 
the left in order to attempt to see beyond a large snow bank in order to enter traffic. 
While waiting for a truck to pass, and without any warning, he was struck by another 
vehicle from the rear resulting in a violent rearward excursion of his body into the seat. 
He was not restrained at the time.  
 
Immediately after the crash, he was dazed and only next remembers the other driver 
tapping on his window. He complained of dizzine ss and blurred vision at the scene. Later 
he was able to return to his practice and see patients. He th en took an electrical galvanic 
stimulator and therapeutic ultrasound home fo r home treatment, whic h his girlfriend, Ms. 
Victoria Mann, assisted him with. Handwritten notes go into detail and give a running 
history of his complaints and treatment, as well as his experiences  with the health care 
practitioners he saw subsequently. He also appears to have been concerned about thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) from a very  early point after his inju ry. Most symptoms occurred 
in the region of the left side  of the neck, left shoulder blade area and arm, and his lower 
back and hip. He continued his home treatm ents, sometimes at a frequency of several 
times per day. 
 
On 1-16-1996 Dr. Traffica was seen by Robert  Shaheen, MD, his private physician. His 
notes are scant. Notes dated 2-22-1996 desc ribe complaints of left arm numbness and 
sharp pain in the left neck region. He  was next seen by Dr. Shaheen on 4-23-1996. 
Talwin and Soma were prescribed. There is a note about usi ng a sledge hammer. 
 
On 1-17-1996 Dr. Traffica was seen by a neurosurgeon named Carroll Osgood, MD. Her records describe lower lumbar complaints and soreness on the left side of his neck 
posteriorly. She also comment ed about cervical ribs. She found a limited cer vical spine 
range of motion, and some limitation in the lu mbar spine as well. She diagnosed a right 
lumbosacral contusion and left posterior ce rvical contusion. Pare nthetically, the notes 
from Dr. Traffica’s office describe some concern that Dr. Osgood did not seem to share the concern for TOS and did not examine his eyes. 
 
Radiographs taken on 2-22-1996 by Jon A. Tirpa k, DO disclose degenerative changes at 
C6-7 with some disc space narrowing. Chest films were normal. Ri b studies disclosed 
bilateral cervical ribs. 
 
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 3 of 14  
On or about 9-20-1996 Dr. Tra ffica was seen in consultation by T.R. Detamore, DO, a 
neurosurgeon. Chief complaints at that time co nsisted of pain in th e left arm, radiating 
into all fingers. He (Dr. Traffica) also had numbness in both hands as well as both arms 
which occurred especially while sleeping.  He  had numbness in his le ft leg indicating his 
foot occasionally, which also included the third, fourth, and fifth digits.  Using his hands 
above his head caused him to become dizzy  and lightheaded.  He  also had problems 
focusing on small print, especially when tired or anxious.  He felt that he’d lost about 
30% strength in his left arm and also had re ported some dizziness and shortness of breath 
following exercise recently.  He apparently  also was using a three pound sledge hammer 
tapping in a mailbox when sudde nly he noted a Lhermitte’s sign.  He also commented 
that immediately after the MVC he could not read signs or tell time.  This occurred for 
about two weeks after the accident.  Dr. De tamore performed a very comprehensive 
examination and reported a number of abnor mal findings, including diminished sensory 
and motor findings, diminished deep tendon re flexes (DTRs), limited ranges of motion, 
oculomotor abnormalities, and number positive orthopaedic tests and neurological tests, including a bilateral Hoffman’s and limited ankle clonus. His diagnosis was cervical 
myelopathy, expect due to degenerative osteoar thritis of the spine with central canal 
lateral recess stenosis with resultant cervi cal spur formation with resultant compression 
of the anterior spinal artery with resultant cervical cord atrophy in coexistence with chronic myofascial pain syndrome, bilateral thoracic outlet syndrom e, vertebral basilar 
insufficiency, as well as internuclear ophthalm oplegia left, felt to be due to motor vehicle 
accident.  It was recommended that he get SEPs, a myelogram, a trial of medication and a 
follow up.   
 
He did undergo somatosensory evoked response testing by Dr. Detamore at that time. He 
found cervical myelopathy, expect due to degenera tive osteoarthritis of the spine with 
central canal lateral recess stenosis with resu ltant cervical spur formation with resultant 
compression of the anterior spinal artery  with resultant cervical cord atrophy in 
coexistence with chronic myofas cial pain syndrome, bilatera l thoracic outlet syndrome, 
vertebral basilar insufficiency, as well as inte rnuclear ophthalmoplegia left, felt to be due 
to motor vehicle accident .  
 
In Dr. Detamore’s report there is a discussion of a prior MV C in which a tractor trailer 
ran a red light and struck Dr. Traffica’s ve hicle head on, resulti ng in a 40 day hospital 
stay. It is my understanding from speaking with  Dr. Traffica that he was taken to hospital 
and there was thought to have been a possibl e concussion. He was ke pt in the hospital 
primarily for observation and rest for about f our days and then was released. No therapy 
was provided and Dr. Traffica did not subseque ntly require any othe r treatment for his 
injury. He has not had any residual di fficulties as a result of the 1969 MVC. 
 
Dr. Detamore also ordered a cervical CT-mye logram which was read by Robert Reither, 
DO. Findings included  spurring at C2-3 re sulting in some impression on the anterior 
thecal sac.  Some hypertrophy is seen aff ecting the ligamentum flavum posteriorly 
causing a shallow impression on the posterior th ecal sac on the right.   At C3-4 a spur 
formation is seen posteriorly on the left causi ng impression on the anteri or thecal sac with 
minimal cord compression noted on the left.  Mild spurring is seen at the joints of 
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 4 of 14  
Luschka, foramen are intact.  At C4-5 spurring is seen posteriorly in  the midline and both 
right and left sides causing impression upon anterior thecal sac with mild cord 
compression.  Spurring is noted throughout joints  of Luschka and foramen are intact.  At 
C5-6 there is spur formation at both sides.  Most pronounced on patient ’s left.  There is 
mild cord compression.  Foramen are intact.  At  C6-7 spurring is seen posteriorly in the 
midline most pronounced on the left side.  There is moderate cord compression on the 
right and moderate to severe cord compression on the left.  There is blunting of the nerve 
root sleeve on the left at the C6-7 level and a herniated disc with fragment in this region 
cannot also be entirely excluded.  CT my elography of the thoracic spine reveals no 
further information.   
 
In December of 1996 Dr. Traffica was seen by Henrik Mike-Meyer, MD who found some 
weakness in his upper extremities and painful cervical range of motion. He reviewed the 
CT-myelogram taken in September and assessed as follows: 1) Chronic left 
supraclavicular pain status-post MVC and 2) C6 -7 spinal stenosis moderate.  Dr. Traffica 
was referred to Dr. Maitra for evaluation to  rule-out thoracic ou tlet syndrome. Notably, 
Dr. Mike-Meyer did not find any significant we akness, reflex changes, or pathological 
reflexes as had Dr. Detamore. Sensory findings were not reported. However, Dr. Traffica 
was also seen around this time (12-16- 1996) by Vincent F. Morgan, MD, who is 
apparently a physiatrist. Dr. Morgan did report upper extremity weakness and possible 
atrophy, as well as motor loss in the left upper extremity. EMG of both upper extremities 
was performed.  He did find some occasional voluntary motor units of increased 
amplitude with normal duration and recruitmen t and mildly increased  polyphasicity.  In 
the left extremity there is increased inserti onal activity in the left triceps with profuse 
spontaneous activity.  Voluntary motor units were mildly increased in amplitude and 
duration but recruitment was markedly decrea sed in a neuropathic pattern and there a 
marked increased in polyphasicity.  The fl exor carpi radialis also had increased 
insertional activity with prof use spontaneous activity.  Voluntary motor units were 
frequently giant and massively enlarged with increased amplitude and duration.  Recruitment was decreased significantly but not to the point of the triceps and there was a 
marked increased in polyphasicity as well.   Although cervical paraspinal muscles were 
also tested, a high baseline arti fact level obscured excellent visualization.  On the left, in 
the paraspinal region, there appeared to be some evidence of positive sharp wave activity.  
The impression was that this was a markedly abnormal study and was consistent with acute and chronic C6-7 radiculopathy in th e left upper extremity.  There was softer 
evidence for the presence of a very mild ch ronic C6-7 radiculopat hy affecting the right 
upper extremity.  Profuse acute denervation wa s present in the left upper extremity and 
none in the right.  He mentioned the possibi lity of a plexopathy.  He believed the odds 
strongly favored the radiculopathy diagnosis.  Marked denervation was noted in both 
triceps and flexor carpi radialis.  These tw o muscles are innervated by separate nerves 
originating from separate cords and trunks of the brachial plexus, he noted, and any 
plexus injury would have injured both cords simultaneously, and would have resulted in 
additional muscles being involved on needle  examination.  The patient’s findings are 
principally left C6-7 but ther e were subtle chronic denervation changes on the right side 
as well.  This would suggest the possibility of  central disc herniation or spinal stenosis 
being responsible.   
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 5 of 14  
 
Dr. Traffica was also seen by Shuba Maitra , MD, a vascular surgeon who did not find 
evidence of  a vascular component of TOS.  
 
On 12-21-1996 an MRI of the cervical spine was obtained. It was read by Scott D. 
Marlowe, MD and revealed straightening of  the cervical spine and a normal appearing 
cord. Mild degenerative changes were noted at C6-7 along with some reduction in disc 
height. Here too was found a broad hernia tion with encroachment of the left 
neuroforamen. There was also a mild broad dor sal disc protrusion at the C7-T1 level with 
mild associated mass affect on the thecal s ac.  Neural foramen appeared slightly 
narrowed although the exiting nerve root sleeve wa s not definitely affected.  The overall 
AP diameter of the canal appeared relative ly narrow from C4 th rough C7-T1, most likely 
on a congenital basis.  No significant dorsal di sc protrusion was identified in any of the 
other cervical levels.   
 
There is a report to Marie Kickler, RN, Me dical Consultants, Options, from Richard 
Kanoff, DO (neurosurgery).  This is a file re view.  Records reviewed include consultation 
of Dr. Osgood, records of Dr. Shaheen, EKG report, drug prescripti ons, x-rays reports, 
and records from Dr. Detamore.  No comme nt regarding handwritten notes from Dr. 
Traffica or records from Dr. Mike-Mayer or  others.  He seems to be describing Dr. 
Osgood’s report which does not indicate the presence of any pathological findings on 
examination.  He also noted the comment about “felt good until using a sledge hammer,” referring to Dr. Shaheen’s note in April of 1996. No examination abnormalities were 
noted.  No other medical records were availabl e until the patient appeared in the office of 
Dr. Detamore on 9-20-96.  Dr. Kanoff goes on to point to Dr. Osgood’s mentioning of 
only left sided neck and the right sided low back pain and th at when he saw Dr. Detamore 
eight months later the clinical picture wa s completely different.  It is noteworthy, 
however, that Dr. Detamore did review Dr . Osgood’s examination and discussed this 
with Dr. Traffica and also noted in his re ports that that examination by Dr. Osgood had 
been “woefully inadequate.” This is consis tent with the concern Dr. Traffica expresses 
contemporaneously in his notes about Dr. Osgood’s examination.   
 
Dr. Kanoff also noted that Dr.  Detamore did not clearly indicate which of the symptoms 
found in September 1996 were attributable to the MVC.  (My interpretation was that Dr. Detamore was attributing all of Dr. Traffica’s symptoms to that MVC.)   Dr. Kanoff also remarked that no mention was made as to whether Dr. Traffica had lost any time from work because of his trauma.  His assessment was that the MVC caused “cervical somatic dysfunction and lumbar somatic dysfunction.”  He  did go as far as to say that there was 
anatomical evidence to support the HNP which, in the absence of prior symptoms, could 
be attributed to the accident.  However, he pointed to the lack of  chronological evidence 
for these symptoms prior to the sledge hamm er incident.  This, based on the fact that 
providers did not mention these symptoms befo re Dr. Detamore.  He pointed out that it 
seems the soft tissue complaints menti oned to Dr. Osgood had resolved by April 1996 
(based on the report of Dr. Shaheen).  If he had symptoms similar to the ones he 
mentioned to Dr. Detamore in September 1996, then it was apparent that his symptoms 
were persisting, he noted.  These comments are apparently coming in response to specific 
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 6 of 14  
questions posed by Ms. Kickler.  Thus, he appe ars to leave this question unanswered.  He 
further noted that it is difficult to spec ifically comment on th e reasonableness or 
appropriateness or necessity of treatment rende red.  He believed that initial symptomatic 
treatment was probably appropriate. Referral to  a neurosurgeon four days after the event 
seems somewhat premature.  But, since Dr. Traffica apparently chose that surgeon to 
guide his care, it was reasonable.  He divi des his response up to this question based on 
the dual possibilities as noted above.  Specifi cally, if Dr. Traffica  had recovered by April 
1996, any subsequent treatment around the time of the sledge hammer episode would not 
be related to the MVC.  In response to a nother question on disabil ity, he responded that 
the records are sparse and he cannot make a determination what kind of disability might 
have been experienced subse quent to the MVC.  He does mention a comment made by 
Dr. Detamore in September that the patient was working but it was unclear whether that 
meant at the time of the evaluation, the time sinc e the accident, or prio r to the accident.  
Regarding the significant spondylosis of the neck and rest of the spine, he finds that it’s 
reasonable to assume that these would have made the effects of his MVC more 
significant.  He also notes that it is possi ble that the accident was responsible for the 
production of a suspected disc herniation at the C6-7 level.   
 
Based on my review of these records, there does  appear to be a continuous record of left 
upper extremity complaint (i.e., up to the time of the sledge hammer incident). These are 
expressed in the handwritten notes of Dr. Traffica and in the 2-22-1996 notes from Dr. 
Shaheen. Thus, it appears that Dr. Kanoff’s opinions are misguided and are based on an 
incomplete set of records. 
 
On 1-28-1997 Dr. Mike-Meyer perfumed an an terior C6-7 discectomy; C6-7 anterior 
cervical fusion with right ili ac crest bone graft; ri ght iliac crest bone graft.  There was 
noted to be extraneous herniated soft disc ma terial present bilaterally.  They also removed 
the marginal osteophytes.   
 
There is a letter to Dr. Traffica from Dr. Deta more in which he expresses his concern that 
this surgery was not in Dr. Tr affica’s best interest. However,  from reading other reports 
from Dr. Detamore, I suspect that the questi on was whether to do a discectomy with vs. 
without fusion, and that Dr. De tamore favored the latter. 
 
Over the course of the next few months, Dr . Traffica had significant improvement in arm 
pain and made good progress. He had physic al therapy at ProCare Rehabilitation 
beginning in March; he reported rather significant pain at that time (3/10).  
 
There is a letter from Howard Senter, MD (neurosurgery) to Patricia Long, RN dated 3-12-1997.  She is at CRA Managed Care, Inc.  Th is is another records review.  Dr. Senter 
is seeing the records of Dr. Osgood, Dr. De tamore, Dr. Shaheen, and radiographic and 
electrodiagnostic studies, as well as two evalua tions by Dr. Mike-Mayer.  He notes that it 
is very clear that Dr. Traffica developed back pain and left sided neck pain after a motor 
vehicle accident of 1-11-96.  He had no complaints of arm pain, numbness, or weakness when he saw Dr. Osgood initially.  Initial radiographs disclosed degenerative disease in the lower cervical region.  Dr. Osgood found no evidence of a root compressive lesion 
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 7 of 14  
and diagnosed a soft tissue injury.  Dr. Traffica had no follow up until April 1996 when 
he was seen by Dr. Shaheen, his primary car e physician.  Dr. Shaheen’s notes indicate 
neck pain and triceps area pain on the left af ter using a sledge hammer and that he “felt 
good” up until using the sledge hammer.  Previous symptoms had resolved with self therapy.  This is important, he notes, because  all subsequent practitioners based their 
history on what the patient told them at that subsequent time.  He describes the 
myelogram and makes the rather convoluted co mment that, “it is also well accepted that 
since the onset of ‘axial or mi dline pain’ it is not an accurate  indicator of the location of 
the disease, it is only the date  of the onset of th e radicular component (in this case left 
arm pain, numbness, and weakness)  which indicates when the di sc actually herniated.  
The first time this gentleman complained of  left arm pain was after using the sledge 
hammer.”  He further noted that the surgery was necessitated as a result of using the sledge hammer and that “it is impossible fo r the motor vehicle accident of January 1996 
to have caused a herniated disc at C6-7 and not had that herniated disc become 
symptomatic (causing left arm pain) until April 1996.”  Therefore, he is attributing a cervical sprain or soft tissue injury as well as lumbar sp rain to the January 1996 motor 
vehicle crash from which the patient had co mpletely recovered.  The sledge hammer 
episode resulted in the herniated disc which necessitated surgery.  T hus, all medical care 
from January 11, 1996 until April 23, 1996 would be related to the motor vehicle crash.   
 
Apparently, Dr. Senter did not  review the copious handwritten notes running from 1-12-
96 to 1-27-97.  Those notes clearly refl ect the ongoing problems in the left upper 
extremity from the very first posttraumatic period right up to the date of the sledge 
hammer incident of 4-20-1996. Nor, apparentl y, did he see the 2-22-96 note from Dr. 
Shaheen describing arm symptoms. His chief argument vis-à-vis Dr. Osgood’s lack of 
notation about the left upper extremity is sim ilar to that of Dr. Kanoff. However, it was 
noted on the form filled out by Dr. Traffica in  Dr. Osgood’s office that one of his chief 
complaints was left arm pain . Thus, their arguments are apparently only based on her 
diagnosis , which did not include radiculopathy or  other neuropathy, not whether any arm 
complaints were made. Based on the fact th at she saw Dr. Traffica on only one occasion 
and that both he and Dr. Detamore describe  her examination as lacking in depth, one 
might question the reliability of  her initial report with respec t to diagnostic completeness. 
Moreover, she did make a diagnosis of “cervi cal contusion” which might, to her way of 
thinking, include a neurologica l component. Only she would be able to answer that 
question. 
 
By April of 1997 Dr. Traffica has contacted Dr . Mike-Meyer and felt he could return to 
work. Most of his arm pain was resolved, al though he continued to have some sense of 
weakness. 
 
On 4-14-1997 there is an addendum report from Dr. Senter to Patricia Long, RN.  He had 
reviewed additional records provided  to him related to the patient’s self treatment and also included records from Dr. Mike-Mayer, Dr. Detamore, and operative records from Mercy Health System.  Based on this re view he found no reason to change the 
conclusions set forth in his orig inal report.  If he is descri bing the handwritten notes from 
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 8 of 14  
Dr. Traffica that I referenced just above, th en he can only be di scounting these records 
out of hand, choosing to selectiv ely rely on limited information. 
 
In June of 1997 yet another file review  was conducted for Marie Kickler, RN by 
Constance Habler, DC. Dr. Haber also spoke with Dr. Traffica by telephone. Dr. Haber 
reviewed the medical records to date. She did not believe that the therapy treatments 
administered by the doctor to himself were  reasonable. She does not believe it is 
reasonable to charge for self care.  She noted  that Dr. Traffica did not submit bills for his 
self treatment until advised to do so by his attorney.  Dr. Shaheen did offer to order therapy but the offer was declined.  Dr. Tr affica was able to request chiropractic 
treatment from his colleagues but had never included an additional request for therapy.  
Daily chart notes provided are,  as she noted, “replete with  the subjective symptomatology 
and the most unfortunate set of circumstances ” yet fail to evidence a treatment plan with 
goal orientation, etc.  She is essentially denying the reasonableness of care based on the 
lack of “goal orientation, acquisition of goals, or compar ative evaluations to objectify 
treatment.”  
 
These terms are apparently thos e of Dr. Haber and are not part  of the standard lexicon in 
medicine or chiropractic. However, it appears,  from reading these notes she’s referring to, 
that most were transcribed by Ms. Mann, who has some experience working for Dr. Traffica, but who is not a physician. Although the notes do not take the form of the 
classic SOAP notes, they do actively desc ribe therapeutic sessions and areas of 
complaints and are, in fact, more comprehe nsive than those taken by many medical and 
chiropractic physicians. In some areas there are orthopaedic tests conducted as well, and 
these should satisfy some of Dr. Habler’s  requirement of “comparative evaluations.” 
Moreover, since Dr. Traffica is himself a physic ian, it seems reasonable to assume that he 
had, as his primary “goal orientation,” to be relieved of pain and dysfunction to whatever 
degree might have been achievable. “Acquisitio n of goals” would seem to be described in 
these notes on the basis of his symptomatic ups  and downs. Why she did not interpret this 
in this way is not clear.  
 
It appears that to me Dr. Traffica was a ttempting to self-treat and maintain his 
chiropractic practice simultaneou sly. This is probably what  many practitioners would do 
under the circumstances. This demonstrates responsible behavior, integrity, hope, and fortitude. It should not be a re ason to deny reimbursement or suggest that his plight was 
trivial. Eventually, of course, he had to turn to surgery. Howe ver, he did manage to return 
to work following his convale scence, which is admirable. 
 
By January of 1998 Dr. Traffica is working 15 hours per week and is released by Dr. Mike-Meyer to full return to work. He does,  however, continue to have some left upper 
extremity symptomatology. By September he’s  having progressive weakness and has had 
to cut back on his work hours. 
 
On 10-15-1998 Dr. Traffica was seen by E.P. Ro y, III, MD (neurologist). He notes that, 
currently, if Dr. Traffica looks up for a prolonge d period of time (30 minutes or more) his 
right eye drifts laterally and he gets blurry vision.  He has numbness and tingling in the 
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 9 of 14  
fourth and fifth fingers radiating down from th e neck in the left upper extremity.  Also, to 
a lesser degree in the right upper extremity.  This comes and goes.  If he lays on his left 
side his whole left arm will become numb.  He has weakness profusely in the arms, left greater than right.  He tires easily, his hands and feet feel cold, and he has shakiness of 
his limbs after exertion.  He also feels his bala nce is off and he still has pain if he pushes 
on his anterior left clavicle.  He has no pain, weakness, or numbness in his legs.  He 
apparently works out on a Nordic Track fo r 40 minutes at a time several times a day.  
Visual exam reveals some intermittent exotropia of the right eye at times.  Otherwise, extraocular eye muscles seem intact grossly in all directions without nystagmus.  The 
neck “has a reasonable range of motion.”  Neck strength is normal in all directions.  Tandem walking is difficult.  There is no drift.   There are no tremors or ataxia.  There is 
good facility in the hands.  There appears to be some wa sting in the left triceps, 
rhomboid, deltoid and supraspinatus areas.  Th ere may be some slight thinning of the 
intrinsic hand muscles on the left as well.   Strength was 4/5 in the left triceps, 
supraspinatus, rhomboid, deltoid and intrinsi c hand muscles.  The right upper extremity 
and other muscles are 5/5 diffusely.  Leg streng th is also 5/5.  No atrophy in the legs.  
“Sensory examination reveals some decreased pinprick sensation in the fourth and fifth 
digits and ulnar palm extending up the late ral forearm and late ral upper arm to the 
shoulder (this is a C8/ulnar di stribution). [sic]”   The right upper extremity has some 
slight sensory changes of an inconsistent natu re in this same pathway.  DTRs are 2/4 in 
the biceps, brachial radialis, quadriceps, a nd Achilles tendons bilate rally.  There is two 
beats of clonus with passive stretch but no re petitive clonus.  The ri ght triceps is 2/4 and 
the left is 1/4.  The pulse remains st eady during various unnamed upper extremity 
manipulation maneuvers intended to define TOS.  He believed the symptomatology may 
have been caused by the accident in question (referring to the C6-7 disc herniation).  Dr. Traffica also seemed to have some radicular component in both upper extremities, left 
greater than right.  This w ould be a C8 distribution.  He noted that more proximal 
weakness and wasting was not entirely clear unless there was an  additional brachial 
plexopathy.  He noted the cervical ribs.  A neurogeni c TOS cannot be excluded 
bilaterally (lower trunk).  He recommended an MRI of the cervical  plus one of the 
brachial plexes bilaterally.  He also reco mmended EMG and NCV studies.  Based on the 
questionable eye movement findi ngs and diagnosis of vertebra l basilar insufficiency, he 
suggested an MRI of the brain.  He recommen ded 25 mg of Doxepin to assist in pain 
control and to help him sleep. 
 
A subsequent EMG study by Dr. Roy revealed: 1) No evidence of more peripheral 
neuropathy including ulnar neur opathy, median  neuropathy, or other.  2) There is 
evidence to suggest a mild old right lower trunk plexopathy (versus C8 radiculopathy).  
In addition, there is evidence to support an active lower trunk plexopathy on the left 
(versus C8 radiculopathy).  The absence of changes in the lower cervical paraspinal 
muscles bilaterally speaks more towards a plexus lesion than a radiculopathy.  In 
addition, I suspect an old C6 radiculopathy ver sus upper trunk plexopathy on the left as 
well.   
 
An MRI of the brain, cervical spine, and br achial plexus was performed on 10-28-1998 at 
Center Community Hospital Diagnostic Im aging Department. The study describes an 
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 10 of 14  
otherwise normal brain MRI.  In the cer vical spine, at C4-5, there is minimal 
subligamentous disc bulge posteriorly.  This doe sn’t appear to contac t the spinal cord and 
cause encroachment and neural foramina are preserved.  There are mild changes of spinal 
stenosis present at C5-6.  This is related primarily to congenital narrowing of the canal 
with very minimal subligamentous disc bulge also evident.  Again, the neural foramina 
are preserved.  Post-discectomy changes are noted at C6-7.  Ther e is no evidence of 
residual or recurrent disc protru sion or herniation.  At C7-T1, there is a central focal disc 
protrusion which does not appear to contact the cord.  No foraminal encroachment is 
present.  Post-gadolinium images show no signs of abnormal enhancement.  The cord 
signal and caliber appear normal.  Multiple sequences were obtained of the thorax.  These include pre and post-gadolinium enhanced images .  Attention to the brachial plexus and 
base of the neck showed no evidence of mass.  No abnormal enhancement follows 
gadolinium.   
 
In December, Dr. Roy offers the following impressions to Dr. Mike-Meyer: 1) Old C6 
radiculopathy on the left.  2) Bilateral lowe r trunk plexopathies which are likely caused 
by neurogenic type TOS.  There is no vascular  component.  3) There does not seem to be 
any central nervous system abnormality.  4) Consideration of surgical correction for 
neurogenic TOS could be considered.  Pain  control could also include tricyclic 
medication.   
 
In March of 1999 Dr. Kanoff writes an adde ndum report to Marie Kickler, RN from 
Medical Consultants, Options after reviewing additional records. These apparently included the noted from Dr. Traffica’s office which he seems to be referring to as physical therapy notes. Based on the complaints  of left arm symptoms up to the time of 
the sledge hammer incident, he says, there’ s no way to sort out what the patient’s 
symptoms were then. He does note, however,  that there is no evidence of radicular 
symptoms prior to the MVC of 1996. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the underlying 
spondylosis became symptomatic as a result of the MVC.  Again, he provides the 
opposite view assuming that there were no ra dicular components until the sledge hammer 
incident.  In that case the radicular symptomatology would not be attributable to the 
MVC.  He finds no way to resolve this conf lict based on review of records.  Regarding 
the TOS, he finds no clear cut documentation to  substantiate it.  He notes the evaluation 
from Dr. Roy, but apparently did not see Dr. Roy’s records.  He is  suggesting that Dr. 
Roy be contacted for his thoughts about this.   
 
Although Dr. Kanoff’s report seems careful and ob jective, his comment that there is no 
way to sort out Dr. Traffica’ s condition at the time of the sledge hammer incident 
contradicts his acknowledgement of the notes  describing (assuming he saw the notes I 
saw), in clear English, what those complaints were at that time and, indeed, ever since the 
MVC. So, if these symptoms did not predate the MVC, as Dr. Kanoff seems to acknowledge, their casual conne ction to the MVC would seem  patently obvious. Why he 
would then have problems sorti ng things out is a mystery to me. As for the TOS, it is not 
clear what form of documentation is needed, although there appears to  be some confusion 
in these records which is explainable. Vascular (Doppler) stud ies run by vascular 
surgeons did not find abnormalities. These studies rule out a vascular type of TOS. 
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 11 of 14  
However, these are less common than th e neurological type for which there is 
documentation in the form of abnormal EMG studies and rather classic symptomatology. 
Finally, Dr. Kanoff ’s comme nt about the MVC causing the “underlying spondylosis 
became symptomatic” misstates the facts. First,  the radiologist reported this spondylosis 
as “mild.” This is degree of change is cons istent with the normal aging process and is 
known to correlate very poorly with symptoms. By middle age about half of us have such 
changes and most are completely asymptom atic. Second, Dr. Traffica’s surgeries were 
not necessitated merely by symptomatic mild  spondylosis. The first was to remove a 
herniated disc and the second and third were for TOS. 
 
As time went on, Dr. Traffica’s condition contin ued to deteriorate. Dr. Traffica was seen 
by Eric Zager, MD (neurosurgeon) on  4-19-1999. Current symptoms involved 
progressive weakness in the upper extremities, mo stly on the left, and particularly in the 
triceps region.  He also complained of bilateral hand numbness involving the middle, 
ring, and small fingers.  Dr. Traffica complained that he did not have the strength to 
manipulate spines because of his triceps weakne ss.  He also had a great deal of difficulty 
with sleep due to uncomfortable sensation in both arms.  There was also mention of some 
nystagmus in the right eye and intermittent difficulty swallowing which were said to be difficult to correlate.  It is noted that he is quite tender over both supraclavicular fossae 
with a Tinel sign over the left side.  Strength was good with the exceptio n of triceps 
which was 4/5.  Dr. Traffica was claiming that his pectoralis major had atrophied on each 
side.  He had a full range of motion in the ce rvical spine with no fo cal tenderness.  There 
was diminished light touch and pinprick sens ation in a somewhat patchy distribution, but 
primarily involving the middle, ring, and small fi ngers, left side worse than right.  Grip 
strength was mildly impaired, but there was no obvious atrophy or fasc iculation seen.  He 
was somewhat sensitive over the ulnar nerves  at the elbow, but not  over the carpal tunnel 
region.  Dr Zager thought he had elements of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, but 
certainly classic findings of a lower trunk brachial plexopathy. 
 
In May of 1999 Dr. Traffica underwent surgical exploration and first rib resection on the 
left by Dr. Zager, and in Ju ly, he had surgery on the righ t side for the same problem. 
External neurolysis was also  performed in both cases.  
 
On 8-8-1999 Dr Kanoff wrote an additional addendum report, this time to Marie Dilucia, RN from Traveler’s Property Casualty. In  it he acknowledges that the MVC of 1996 was 
responsible for the radicular symptoms into  the left upper extremity. Thus, the first 
surgery was, in his opinion, justified on the basi s of this crash. He also noted that the 
diagnosis of TOS was excluded by a variety of tests. As not ed earlier, this would have 
been true only for a vascular form of TOS—not the neurogenic form (i.e., brachial 
plexopathy) which was, in fact, the operative diagnosis. It’s not clea r from this report 
whether Dr. Kanoff was even aware that the two TOS surgeries had indeed taken place 
by the time he wrote his report. 
 
In January of this year, Dr. Roy summarized his opinions regarding ca usation in a letter 
to you. In it he reiterated his diagnostic impr essions and went on to note that a large HNP 
could have been caused by the MVC.  This would have resulted in the C6 radiculopathy

on the left.  He cannot be sure if the rema inder of the symptoms were caused by the MVC 
or not.  The bilateral plexus lesions he felt were secondary to the neurogenic thoracic 
outlet syndrome due to the cervical ribs bilaterall y.  It is possible, he  notes, that the motor 
vehicle accident accelerated or exacerbated the problem s in his brachial plexus 
bilaterally, but it is difficult for him to be absolutely certain. 
 
It is noteworthy, however, that there were no symptoms of brachial plexopathy or TOS 
prior to the 1996 MVC. This la st statement may indicate some  confusion in this regard. 
 
Also in January of this year there is a similar report from Dr. Detamore. He also was of 
the opinion that the MVC caused the injury  requiring the first surgery. However, it 
appears that he has not seen  Dr. Traffica since September of 1996 and may not be aware 
of the continuing problems with TOS. Thus  he did not comment about the need for 
surgery in that case. 
 
A similar report from Dr. Mike-Meyer was reviewed. It was dated 2-23-2000 and in it he recapped the history of care for Dr. Traffica subsequent to his 1996 MVC. His statement 
was that the MVC aggravated a degenerative ce rvical condition at C6-7 at which point he 
became symptomatic. 
 
Again, it is noteworthy that th e past medical history of Dr. Traffica includes nothing 
about neck pain, radicular pain in either uppe r or lower extremities, or any evidence that 
this cervical spondylosis was in fact symptomatic. These ki nds of degenerative changes 
are quite common in persons Dr. Traffica’s ag e and have not been shown to correlate 
well with symptoms. In the majority of cases they are asymptomatic. Moreover, when spondylosis is symptomatic, surgery is almost never contemplated in such a mild case. 
These degenerative changes do, however, pred ispose the spine to greater injury and a 
slower or less complete recovery afte r this type of MVC. Thus, the word aggravated , 
which implies making a clinically apparent condi tion worse, is a bit of a misnomer in this 
context. 
 
Finally, dated 3-9-2000 there is a brief report from Dr. Zager st ating that the need for the 
bilateral TOS surgeries was di rectly related to the MVC of  1996, with the cervical ribs 
acting as a predisposing factor. 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
Dr. Stephen R. Traffica was inju red when his vehicle was stru ck from the rear by another 
vehicle in an icy parking lot. Dr. Traffica c ontinued to work as a chiropractic physician 
seeing patients to the best of  his ability. He applied self-treatments of therapeutic 
ultrasound and galvanic electros timulation to himself at home with the assistance of his 
girlfriend. She also assisted him in some aspects of his self-examination and note taking. 
 
He continued to have difficulties with his vision, neck pain, left sided arm and scapular 
pain, and low back pain. After a series of  electrodiagnostic tests and imaging studies, 
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 13 of 14  
which are summarized above, he was dia gnosed as suffering from internuclear 
ophthalmoplegia, cervical myelopathy, bilatera l thoracic outlet syndrome, disc herniation 
(C6-7) and radiculopathy in  the left upper extremity.  
 
He underwent surgery with Dr. Mike-Meyer to  remove the C6-7 disc first. This was 
accomplished with a strut graft harvested from his own iliac crest. He recovered from this 
procedure uneventfully and with a high degr ee of improvement in arm pain. Thus, the 
surgery acted to confirm the diagnosis of HN P and was clinically i ndicated. However, Dr. 
Traffica continued to have left upper extr emity numbness, weakness, and progressive 
deterioration related to his bilateral TOS, which was complicated by bilateral cervical ribs. Over the course of several months the condition became progressively more disabling. 
 
Left brachial plexus explorati on with cervical rib resection and external neurolysis was 
undertaken in May of 1999 by Dr. Zager. Followi ng that, in July of that year, the same 
procedure was performed on the right side, providing Dr. Traffica with significant relief.  
 
Risk Analysis 
 
Several risk factors in this case are notewo rthy with regard to u nderstanding the cause 
and effect relationship between low speed cr ash and injury. Risk factors for injury 
include the rear impact vector, known to be mo re injurious than any other vector crash, 
the fact that Dr. Traffica did not expect or brace for the impa ct, the fact that he had his 
head turned at the time of imp act, the fact that he was essent ially out of position (forward 
in the seat and body twisted to the left), the fact that he is middle aged (as opposed to 
being in his twenties for example), the fact that he did have some cervical spondylosis, 
albeit mild by the radiologist’s description, the fact that the cras h occurred on an icy 
parking lot, the presence of bilateral cervical ribs and a congenitally narrow spinal canal, 
and his immediate ons et of symptoms.  
 
Causation 
 
In my opinion, the disc herniation occurred at the time of injury and necessitated the first 
surgery. The neck injury also set into mo tion a gradually developing bilateral TOS, 
complicated by his previous asymptomatic cervi cal ribs. This eventually led to the need 
for the subsequent two surgeries. Thus, it is  my opinion, with a reasonable degree of 
medical and chiropractic certaint y, that all of the injuries de scribed above, and all of the 
treatment rendered to Dr. Traffica for those inju ries, can be directly attributed to the 1996 
MVC. 
 
Although some of the file reviewers in this ca se attempted to attach  great significance to 
the April 1996 mailbox and sledge hammer in cident (see above), it’s clear from 
contemporaneous records that that incident did no more than temporarily exacerbate an 
already quite symptomatic condition.  
 
TRAFFICA, Stephen 
Page 14 of 14  
Prognosis 
 
Dr. Traffica can probably expect some degree of  permanent discomfort. It is rare that 
patients undergo spinal fusion in the cervi cal region—especially following trauma—and 
become completely asymptomatic. Due to gradual biomechanical changes imposed by 
fixing two vertebrae in total arthrodesis, some accelerated degenerative changes can be 
expected at adjacent segments, which will like ly themselves become symptomatic in the 
future.  
 
The prognosis with regard to the TOS is less cer tain at this point. Since the last surgery 
was only about 10 months ago as I write this , it is likely that so me degree of further 
improvement in strength, range of motion, fl exibility, sensitivity, and general comfort 
will be attainable with consistent rehabilitativ e efforts, regular exercise, and the tincture 
of time.  
 
Thank you for allowing me to analyze this in teresting case. If I can be any firther 
assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

RE:  ELROY, Jason 
 DOI: 7-10-2003 
 DOE: 5-26-2006 
 
Dear Mr. Grady: 
 
The following is my evaluation of the motor vehicle crash (MVC) of 7-10-2003 in which 
Mr. Elroy was injured. 
 
 
SOCIAL HISTORY 
 
Mr. Elroy is unmarried and is self-employed as a photographer.  He does contract work as 
a photographer from time to time. He is a non-smoker and non-drinker. 
 
 
MEDICAL HISTORY 
 
Mr. Elroy denied any previous major surger ies or serious illnesses. At the age of 
approximately 15 years, he fell off his bicy cle and fractured both forearms (ulna and 
radius) and was treated with cast immobilizatio n. He has no residuals from that episode. 
He did not recall ever having any prior treatment for neck or back pain. 
 
 
HISTORY OF INJURY 
 
Mr. Elroy related that he was the restrain ed driver of a 2000 Mercedes SL500 and had 
come to a stop at an intersection. He noticed another vehicle approaching from the rear 
and became aware that he was about to be struck  by that vehicle. He believes that he had 
his foot on the brake at the time and his head turned somewhat to the right and slightly 
extended as he gazed into the rear view mirro r of his car at the moment of impact. There 
was another vehicle approximately one half a car length in front of him, also stopped at 
the traffic light and he did not collide with th at vehicle after being struck. The collision 
was described as a 180 degree colinear impact w ith little or no offset. I asked him about 
2731 Via Orange Way, Ste. 105, Spring Valley, CA 91978   •  voice (800) 423-9860 or (619) 660-8802   •  FAX (619) 423- 3084  •  e-mail drcroft@srisd.com

his head restraint and he rela ted that he usually kept it adjusted vertically about two 
inches and angled slightly toward his head. He  believes that his head struck the restraint 
at the time of the collis ion. After the collision, he and the other driver were able to drive 
their vehicles from the scene. Police were on the scene after the collision. Mr. Elroy does not recall where he went after the collision, bu t he did not visit the ER and did not go to 
work. Within hours of the crash, Mr. Elroy rela ted to me that he could hear a “squishy 
sound” in his neck and had limited range of motion and pain. This condition worsened over hours and approximately 2-3 days later, he sought the care of a chiropractor named 
Belling. Dr. Belling treated him for several months using various PT modalities and 
spinal manipulation. Although he has not had complete remission, he did note that the 
treatment helped with pain re lief on a contemporaneous basis. 
 
Because he was not experiencing the kind of ra pid pain relief he had hoped for, he also 
went to the local hospital ER a few days later and was seen by a Dr. Green. He was 
examined and given medication for pain and an  instruction sheet relating to self-care. 
 
Some time later he was seen by an orthopaed ic surgeon, Dr. Dorsey. He was also later 
seen by a neurologist, Dr. Mahdad. 
 
 
ORIGINAL CHIEF COMPLAINTS  
 
1. Within hours of the crash Mr. Elroy compla ined of a “squishy sound” in his neck 
and had limited range of motion (ROM) and pain motion. This was exacerbated by walking and exercising and relieved  somewhat by chiropractic, massage by 
girlfriend, medications, rest, and, initially, by the medica tions he was given. This 
neck pain was described as a stiffness; sharp and aching; posterio r, left side more 
than the right. He also ha d tingling in the fingers of his left hand. The neck pain 
radiated into his left trap ezius region and was described as constant and moderate 
in severity. 
2. Mr. Elroy also complained of mid-back pa in of constant and moderate severity, 
with provocative and pallia tive factors as above. He indicated an area extending 
from about T5 to about T10. The pain  was described as stiff and aching. 
3. He complained also of headaches which extended from the occipital region to over the back of his skull not quite to the vertex. These were also  initially constant 
and moderate in severity with the pal liative and provocative factors as mentioned. 
 
 
CURRENT CHIEF COMPLAINTS 
 
1. Mr. Elroy continues to have neck pain in  the areas as described above. This pain 
continues to be exacerbated by work. He re lated that he has to take more breaks 
now and organizes his work schedule so that he doesn’t have to work 8 hours 
ELROY, Jason

straight. He gets some tem porary relief from rest and massage from his girlfriend. 
He does not take over-the-counter medications  because he is concerned with side 
effects. The pain he has now is described as varying from a sharp pain to an ache and he continues to feel that he has decreased ROM to left an upward (extension). He also continues to experience numbness, generally in the hand. Sometimes when he wakes up his whole left arm feel s numb. The neck pain occurs daily and 
is never better than minimal in sever ity, but becomes moderate when he is 
working. 
2. He continues to have headaches which he  has over the same regions. They are 
daily and slight in severity. Provocative and palliative featur es are as above. 
 
Asked to rate his overall improvement, Mr. Elroy reported to me that his mid-back pain is 
completely resolved; the neck pain has re solved about 50%; and the headaches have 
resolved about 60-80%. 
 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
 
General 
 
Mr. Elroy is a well nourished 31-year-ol male standing 5 feet  11 inches in  height and 
weighing 205 lb. He is right hand dominan t and sits through the examination process 
without overt signs of pain. He has an athletic build and high level of fitness. Blood pressure 
was 120/70 mmHg, pulse was 68 bp m, and respiration was 12 bpm. 
 
Head 
 
Oral, ophthalmological, and otoscopic examinat ions were unremarkable. The TM apparatus 
was normal. 
 
Cervical Spine 
 
Ranges of motion in the cervical spine were record ed using the JTech TrackerTM  (JTech 
Medical, Salt Lake City, UT ), a digital co mputer interface utili zing wireless dual 
inclinometry. Figure 1 is a ba r chart of the age- and gender-normalized expected vs. actual 
ROMs in the 6 standard degr ees of freedom based on regre ssion equations developed by 
Youdas et al. from a large ag e-stratified study of asymptoma tic and atraumatic male and 
female subjects [1]. The white bars represent the statical probable range of the respective 
motions for a 31-year-old uninjured normal male. The gray bars repr esent the statistical 
mean of the actual measur ed ranges I recorded during my examination of Mr. Elroy, and the 
black bars indicate percentage of deviation (in this case loss) of ROM from the expected. All

measured ranges fell within a 2-4%  coefficient of vari ation indicating a cred ible effort. This 
method of assessing patient ve racity has been shown to be more sensitive than the AMA 
Guidelines methodology [2].  Cervical extension was li mited by 36.4%, which is a 
significant loss. 
 
Palpation of the cervical and upper thoraci c regions revealed general mid-cervical 
tenderness over the facet regions and mild musc le spasm in the left paraspinal region. No 
trigger points were found.

Thoracolumbar Spine 
 
Ranges of motion in the lumbar spine were with in normal limits. Flexio n was limited to five 
inches fingertips to floor, but this was due only to  hamstring inflexibil ity. No paraspinal 
tenderness or trigger points were found and there was no si gnificant guarding or muscle 
spasm. No tattoos or scars were noted. 
 
ELROY, Jason 
Page 5 of 13 
 
 
Extremities 
 
Range of motion in the major jo ints of the upper an d lower extremities wa s full and painless. 
 
Grip strength was measured using the JTech TrackerTM dynamometer set at the second 
station. Rapid exchange grip strength, in  which the subject rapidly squeezes the 
dynamometer and then switches hands and sq ueezes with the other hand, was rapidly 
repeated for 10 repetitions. This is a validity test of effort and revealed an average grip 
strength of 88.9 lb on the left  and 90.4 lb on  the right. The test wa s deemed statistically 
valid.  
 
Digital algometry was measur ed using the JTech TrackerTM pressure transducer. This is a 
test of pain tolerance and also serves as a me asure of patient veracity. In all positions I was 
unable to exert sufficient force to  elicit the degree of pain need ed to determine end points. In 
other words, Mr. Elroy has a very  high level pain tolerance.  
 
Circumferential measurem ents of the extremities  were as follows:  
 
      R i g h t    L e f t  
 
  Arm    15.0 in   15.0 in 
  Forearm   13.0 in   12.5 in 
  Thigh    19.0 in   18.5 in 
  Calf    16.5 in   16.0 in 
 
Muscle strength, as eval uated by manual muscle testing, was felt to be 5/5 in all groups of 
both upper and lower extremities. However, it is  noteworthy that Mr. Elroy is very athletic 
and minor variations in strength ar e difficult to detect with manu al muscle testin g. Ranges of 
motion in the major joints of both upper and lower extremities were full and painless. There 
were not deformities. 
 
Neurological Examination 
 
With the exception of the biceps  which was 1+ bilaterally, deep  tendon reflexes were 2+ and 
equal bilaterally in both upper  and lower extremities.  Cran ial nerves III through XII were 
intact and there wa s no evidence of pathologi cal reflex or cl onus. Sensitivity to  pinprick was 
preserved throughout. Romb erg’s test was negative. Mr. was al ert, oriented in person, place, 
and time, and has a normal fund of knowledg e. No pathological reflexes were noted. 
 
sEMG Examination 
 
Dynamic surface electromyography (sEMG) was performed on th e day of the examination. 
After the skin surface was prep ped, electrodes were placed over the sternocleidomastoideus

muscles and paraspinal muscles, with partic ular attention paid to precise symmetrical 
placement, and Mr. Elroy was ta ken through a standard kinema tic montage which consisted 
of repeat flexion-neutral-flexion,  left and right lateral flexion, and cervical rotatio n to the left 
and right. After sufficient wa rm-up, recording were made in  all ranges. The traces were 
relatively normal with the exce ption of the right SCM muscle  which demonstrated a 40% 
reduced amplitude output, Figure 2. Variances of this magnitude and type are not found in 
normal necks. The findings are consistent with chronic neck pain with  asymmetrical motor 
control.

Whiplash Disability Questionnaire (WDQ) 
 
Mr. Elroy completed this questi onnaire on the date of the examination and his mean score 
was 5.9 indicating signifi cant ongoing disability. 
 
CAD Symptoms Questionnaire 
 
The CAD Symptoms Questionnaire is one that I use to assess the credibility of the patient’s claims. Mr. Elroy completed this questionnaire on the date of the examination 
and his responses well within normal lim its indicating that he was not symptom 
magnifying.

REVIEW OF RECORDS  
 
P. Douglas Kiester, M.D.  Dr. Kiester, an orthopaedic surgeon, saw Mr. Elroy on 3-8-2006 for a defense medical examination. Apparently, Mr. Elroy did not provide answers to many of the questions put to him by Dr. Ki ester regarding the collision and his medical 
history. He complained of neck pain and an ache in his lumbar region, severity not 
indicated. He reviews a cervical MRI study da ted 12-2-2003. It appears that he saw the 
film, but I cannot be certain from reading the report. He noted multiple bulges in the neck 
with the largest at C5-6; all, however, were  “relatively small.” Some limitation of left 
cervical rotation is noted (lat eral flexion not assessed). Upper and lower extremity 
reflexes were listed as “0.” The meaning of this is unclear. Left forearm hypersensitivity 
was noted. Under “Assessment” he has “No evidence of injury in this incident.” He reviewed photos of the subject vehicle. He  reviewed records from Hoag Hospital and 
from Drs. Dorsey and Mahdad and “chiropract or Kowal.” Apparently there was a brief 
disagreement in the office with Mr. Elroy a nd Dr. Kiester and staff. In any event, Dr. 
Kiester did not believe Mr. Elroy was injure d in the motor vehicl e collision of 7-10-2003, 
noting that for disc injury to occur there must be both compression and rotation and that, 
in a rear-end type accident, ther e is distraction and no rotation. 
 
Videofluoroscopy (VF) Study  The VF study showed the cer vical spine under forward 
and backward bending (lateral and oblique pr ojections), lateral bending. AP rotation and 
APOM with lateral bending. Upper cervic al motion during flexion may be limited by 
spasm. Lateral motion of C1 on C2 during late ral bending may indicate capsular injury at 
C1-2. 
 
Photos  There are several black and white photoc opies of photos taken of a Mercedes 
Benz SL500. They appear to show some cosmetic damage to the rear bumper fascia. 
 
Griffith Appraisal  There is an appraisal of property da mage to Mr. Elroy’ Mercedes for 
$647.00. There is also a damage assessmen t by Mercury Insurance Group for $783.09. 
 
Traffic Collision Report  The collision report describe d the bullet vehicle as a 1997 
Oldsmobile 88 which sustained some degree of  damage to the front bumper and grill. 
 
Hoag Memorial Hospital  Presbyterian  The date of the records is 7-16-2003 and Mr. 
Elroy was complaining of headache (6/10), a nd neck and back pain  (8/10). He was found 
to have decreased ROM, muscle spasm, a nd was given ibuprofen (800 mg), Vicodin (5 
mg), and Flexeril (10 mg). He was seen by William Green, M.D., and told to follow up with John J. Wu, M.D. if symptoms continued.

Back Bay Chiropractic  First date of service was 7-14-2003. He was seen there on 28 
occasions through 11-4-2003. The diagnoses list ed were cervical radiculitis, cervical 
spine segmental dysfunction with strain  and sprain, and pelvic subluxation. 
 
South Coast MRI Center  On 12-2-2003 an MRI of the cervical spine was ordered 
through Michael Mahdad, M.D. and reported by Thomas Walden, M.D. There was a 3 
mm broad-based bulge at C4-5  and C5-6, with “high disc  or osteophytes” noted along 
with mild desiccation.  
 
Southern California Neurology Specialists Medical Group   On 12-1-2003 M. Michael 
Mahdad, M.D. saw Mr. Elroy for neurological consultation. He found hypesthesia in the 
left ulnar distribution. ROM in the cervic al spine was limited in left rotation and 
extension. On 3-22-2004 Dr. Mahdad conducte d needle EMG and NCV tests of the 
paraspinal and upper extremity muscles and peripheral nerves. He diagnosed a mild left 
C5 radiculopathy but noted that the cannot be considered a definitive diagnosis. A report from Dr. Mahdad, is dated 3-22-2004. He is  seen for follow-up. He is still having 
predominantly left-sided neck pain. There is  also some pain and cramping in the left 
scapula and left arm sympto ms upon awaking sometimes. Th ere is some hypesthesia in 
the left forearm, ulnar area. ROM was repor ted to be “good,” but no ranges were given. 
His diagnosis is “cervical spine diseas e with left cervical radiculopathy.” 
 
South County Orthopaedic Associates   On 9-17-2003 Mr. Elroy was seen by John B. 
Dorsey, M.D., and orthopaedics surgeon. He was referred there by Rick Belling, D.C. for evaluation. His complaints were of neck and back pain, with numbness in the fingers and 
thumb. ROM in the lumbar spine and major join ts is reported as being normal. There is 
no mention of the cervical spine ROM. Neur ological examination, including sensory 
examination, is normal. His diagnosis is cerv ical spine strain/sprai n with radiculopathy 
and thoracic spine strain/sprain. He recomme nds continued chiropractic care. Dr. Dorsey 
saw Mr. Elroy again for follow-up on 8-18-2004, taking note of the te sts that had been 
performed since he last saw Mr. Elroy, and wa s of the impression that he would go on to 
develop degenerative disc disease at the C4-6  levels and that he should refrain from 
contact sports, running, and heavy lifting activi ties because they would likely accelerate 
this condition. He noted that the disc bulges were pathologic  and attributed both to the 
motor vehicle collision of 7-10-2003. 
 
MRI Examination  A flexion and extension, non-contra st, weight-bearing MRI of the 
cervical spine was obtained on 5-26-2006. Th e results were interpreted by Jason, 
Vanderford, M.D. and were as follows: 
 
1. Left maxillary sinusitis [not rela ted to motor vehicle collision]. 
2. At C2/3 there is disc desiccation and a 2.0 mm broad-based disc protrusion that 
effaces the thecal sac. The disc protrusion increases to 2.2 mm in flexion and decreases to 1.4 mm in extension. 
ELROY, Jason 
Page 9 of 13 
 
 
3. At C3/4 there is a 2.0 mm broad-based disc  protrusion that effaces the spinal cord. 
There is bilateral encroachment of the neural foramina. The disc protrusion 
increases to 3.2 mm in extension and 2.2 mm in flexion. This is a significant 
change. 
4. At C4/5 there is disc desiccation and a 2.2 mm broad-based disc protrusion that 
effaces the spinal cord. There is bilatera l encroachment of the neural foramina 
with effacement of the exiting C5 nerve roots. The disc protrusion maintains 2.2 
mm in flexion and decreases to 2.0 mm in extension. Bilateral degenerative facet 
disease is present.  
5. At C5/6 there is disc desiccation and a 3.2 mm broad-based disc protrusion that 
effaces the spinal cord and causes moderate spinal canal stenosis. There is bilateral encroachment of the neural fora mina with impingement of the exiting C6 
nerve roots. The disc protrusion decreas es to 3.0 mm in extension and to 2.2 mm 
in flexion. This is a significant change. Bilateral degenerativ e facet disease is 
present. 
6. At C6/7 there is disc desiccation and a 3.2 mm broad-based disc protrusion that 
effaces the thecal sac. There is bilateral encroachment of the neural foramina [and] effacement of the exiting C7 nerve roots. The disc protrusion decreases to 
2.2 mm in extension and to 1.4 mm in fl exion. This is a significant change. 
Bilateral degenerative facet disease is present. 
  
 
OVERALL DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS 
 
1. Cervical acceleration/deceleration injury, gr ade 4, secondary to rear impact motor 
vehicle crash, 7-10-2003, w ith chronic neck pain. 
2. Disc protrusion C5-6 which effaces the spinal cord and causes moderate spinal canal stenosis, secondary to rear im pact motor vehicle crash, 7-10-2003. 
3. Referred neurological-type symptomatology into left upper extremity secondary 
to #s 1 and 2.  
4. Chronic headaches probably related to # 2 above. 
5. Chronic mild left-sided C5 radiculo pathy (per electrodiagnostic study and 
confirmed by MRI) secondary to rear impact motor vehicle crash, 7-10-2003. 
6. Mid-thoracic pain, probably from a mild sp raining injury secondary to rear impact 
motor vehicle crash, 7-10-2003;  resolved. 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Mr. Elroy was involved in a rear impact moto r vehicle collision in which his head was 
turned to the right and slightly extend ed. The collision velocity is unknown. The 2000 
Mercedes Benz SL500 is equipped with 5 mph bumpers, the 1988 Oldsmobile Eighty-
eight with 2.5 mph bumpers. The bumper hei ghts of the two vehicles  are compatible and 
ELROY, Jason 
Page 10 of 13 
 
 
crash photos of the Mercedes indicate bumper c ontact. Both vehicles have a similar gross 
vehicle weight (Mercedes 4670 lb; Oldsmobile 4552 lb). Tests using similar sized vehicles and bumper systems at my institute have repeatedly demonstrated that repeated 
collisions at closing velociti es of 9 mph or higher can be staged with resulting damage no 
greater than what is seen on the Merced es. The predicted crash damage threshold 
between cars with this relative mass and bumper rating combination occurs when the resulting delta V is 8 mph [3]. These crash velocities produce changes in velocities for 
the struck vehicle of up to 7 mph, well in excess of the mean delta V known to result in whiplash-type injuries [4]. Mr. Elroy’ head turned position at the moment of impact greatly increased his risk for injury by con centrating the loads asymmetrically through his 
facet joints and discs, concentrating the forces  on those structures [5, 6]. Other relevant 
risk factors for poor outcome following whiplash  injury include the use of seat belts and 
shoulder harness [7] [note that I do not advocate NOT using them, but they do increase the severity and duration of whiplash injuries], rear vector collision [6, 8], early onset of 
symptoms [9], initial back pain [10], initial upper extremity symptoms [6, 11], and high pain intensity [12]. The initial  “squishy feeling” he had in his neck was most likely the 
result of capsular bleeding which would indicate ligamentous injury. 
 
Grip, ROM, and algometry recordings all s uggest a lack of symp tom magnification of 
malingering, as do the questionn aires Mr. Elroy completed. Th ese were also concordant 
with my examination of him. He is clear ly athletic and demonstrates a very high 
tolerance to pain. This desire to remain fit is an admirable one and it should not be taken 
as evidence of an absence of  pain. ROM is now considered one of the most important 
determinants and measures of outcome in whiplash trauma, having high sensitivity and 
specificity [13-15]. Mr. Elroy has minor losse s (10%) in lateral flexion and a significant 
loss (36%) in extension of the neck. His WDQ mean scor e of 5.9 indicates significant 
ongoing disability. This instrument has been de monstrated to have excellent short- and 
medium-term reproducibility and responsiven ess in a population se eking treatment for 
whiplash [16, 17]. The CAD Symptoms Ques tionnaire indicates a lack of symptom 
magnification, and the NDI score indicates a marked degree of ongoing disability (44%). 
The NDI has been demonstrated to have high degree of internal consistency, reliability, 
and responsiveness in whiplash populations [15] and has become a standard in the 
research community. 
 
The sEMG findings are consistent with chronic neck pain. Side to side amplitude muscle frequency variations of 40% are not seen in a population of persons who do not have 
chronic neck pain. 
 
Dr. Kiester commented in his report that for disc injury to occur there must be both 
compression and rotation and that, in a rear-end type accident, there is distraction and no 
rotation. While lumbar discs are known to be most vulnerable to a combination of 
compression and rotation, it is not true that this loading pattern is necessary for disc 
injury to occur. Moreover, cervical disc inju ries from rear impact motor vehicle crashes 
are typically produced by a combination of shear, bending, compression, and tension. 
Generally, compressive forces ar e greater than tensile forces, in contrast to Dr. Kiester’s 
ELROY, Jason

model. When rotation is present, as it was in this case, it further co mplicates this already 
complex series of loading paths.   
 
 
PROGNOSIS AND FU TURE MEDICAL 
 
I would concur with Dr. Dorsey’s comment that the changes seen on MRI would most 
likely result in an accelerated degenerative process at the levels  involved. I have not 
personally reviewed that set of films, but it appears that some changes have occurred in 
the interim based on the recent (5-26-2006) MRI findings. In the worst case scenario, this 
could necessitate a future cervical spine surger y, but it is difficult to assign a probability 
to that eventuality. Nevertheless, once injured, discs do not have the capacity to heal and 
continue to break down over time. They ar e also significantly more susceptible to 
subsequent injury. I think it is probably unrea listic to suggest that Mr. Elroy refrain from 
participation in heavy lifting because this is clearly a lifestyle he has chosen, and because the exercise and the fitness level it provides probably stabiliz es him physically and 
emotionally. For example, heavy exercise is associated with endorphin release. He did 
mention to me, however, that his workouts now are less strenuous because he “pays for it later” if he tries to work out at his preinjury level.  
 
If Mr. Elroy obtains temporary relief from chiropractic care , he should avail himself of 
that treatment, at least on an as needed basis.  In either case, my opinion is that he should 
not expect any improvement in his current phys ical condition. His injuries are permanent 
and, with the progression of degenerative changes, are like ly only to worsen over time.

Qualifications 
 
I am a licensed chiropractor in the state of Ca lifornia and have specia lized in the area of 
whiplash trauma for the past 24 years. I am also a board certified chiropractic orthopaedist as well as an accident reconstructionist. I have co-authored two textbooks on the subject of whiplash and TMD and over 300 professional papers, and I have lectured fairly extensively in the U.S. and abroad on this topic. I am a member of the International 
Whiplash Task Force, and have participated  in dozens of  research projects over the 
years, including two at th e RAND corporation and several at my own institution. The 
majority of these concern cervical spine or other neuromusculoskelet al injuries arising 
from motor vehicle trauma, as well as their clinical assessment and management. I served 
as an examination commissioner for the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners for several years. I was the original developer of  the whiplash grading system that is now 
used internationally. My institute has conducte d more than 80 full scale crash tests over 
the years, most of which have involved human  subject volunteers, most of them rear 
impact crashes as lower velocities, and seve ral of which utilized anthropometric test 
dummies.   
 
Overview of the Injury 
 
Based on a review of the documents enumerat ed above, including the two-part deposition 
transcript of Dr. Rogers dated January 19 and January 24 2006, her collision occurred on 
March 11, 2004, while she was driving and had come to a sudden stop which was necessitated by the vehicle immediately in fr ont of her coming to a sudden stop for a 
school bus or handicap bus which had stoppe d on the opposite side of the road. She 
believes she had come to a complete stop when her car, a 1989 Cadillac Deville, was struck from behind by an 1997 F-100 Ford pick up truck. She believes that she may have 
either steered slightly to the right or been pushed slightly to  the right by the collision. She 
stated that she was wearing her seat belt a nd shoulder harness at the time. She was not 
aware of the impending collision when it occu rred. She does recall that her head struck 
the head restraint which she stated was probably in the down position or not properly 
adjusted. She also believes she may have struck her left knee on the knee bolster. 
Although it was sore briefly, it resolved w ithout the need for further attention.

Gary Yamaguchi, Ph.D. provided a biomechani cal assessment of the crash and injuries 
reportedly sustained in his January 10, 2006 re port. Using information gleaned from the 
National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) database, Dr. Yamaguchi estimated that the change of velocity (delta V) of Ms.. Rogers’ Cadillac was approximately 12-13 mph. This crash velocity is above the reported to lerance threshold in th e literature and would 
have been consistent, in his opinion, with “musculotendon avulsion inju ry to the anterior 
musculature of the neck, or a ligament injury.”  He also noted that in a crash test of a 
Nissan Pulsar, conducted at his facility, a r ear impact of 20 mph produced a change of 
velocity  of 12 mph, with the target (struck)  vehicle experiencing an  acceleration of 13 g. 
 
There is an AP and lateral thoracic spin e radiographic study dated 10-18-2000 which was 
interpreted by Philip Bain, D.O. as showing mild T-L lumbar dextroscoliosis and minimal mid-thoracic degenerative arthrosis an d the suggestion of an old rib fracture at 
the T12 vertebral segment. No indi cations were given for this study. 
 
Dr. Rogers stated that she did not drive much after the collision. She complained of 
headaches, neck pain, upper thoracic area pai n, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain 
and dysfunction. Initially she had problems w ith locking and eventually developed a 
closed lock. She did note that prior to the collisio n she had some popping in the joint, but 
no other problems. She has used an app liance on and off since the collision. 
 
She stated that she had very limited range of motion (ROM) in her neck and that the pain 
was “horrendous,” as was swallowin g. Some time around the summer of 2004, she 
started wearing a rigid cervical brace, wh ich gave her some relief. She also had 
paresthesias extending into he r left upper extremity and ev entually underwent bilateral 
carpal tunnel release surgery to relieve the e ffects of her compressive neuropathies. She 
also developed a trigger thumb, which was t hought to result from wearing carpal tunnel 
splints, and eventually had surgery to corre ct that condition on 5-13-2005 by Thomas E. 
Butler, Jr., M.D. He also performed the carp al tunnel surgeries (r ight on 10-6-2005; left 
on 10-21-2005). She noted that she did attempt to control her pain with a TENS device, 
but had little success. Dr. Rogers hired a locum tenens  to manage her practice while she 
was disabled. By early June of 2004, she stated  that she was not able to continue work. 
She attempted unsuccessfully to return later in September of that year. She sold her 
practice to the woman w ho she had hired as a locum tenens , a Dr. Patel. She was treated 
for depression with Effexor for three to six m onths after her injury and noted that she had 
been treated for a situation depression once wh en she was in college. She also described a 
single episode of lower thoracic back pain in  the past which lasted  about four weeks. 
 
On 4-2-2004 Dr. Lenard underwent MRI scan of the cervical spine. Th e neuroradiologist 
(Dr. Wachter) reported mild spondylosis with  mild-moderate foraminal stenosis at C4-
C7. These changes are superimposed upon a developmentally small canal. On this date 
there is also a 7-view cerv ical plain film study and a t horacic study by Robert Reese, 
M.D., demonstrating no fracture,  subluxation, or prespinal sw elling. There were very tiny 
spurs at the left C5-6 uncovertebral joint. The thoracic views showed very minimal scoliosis.

On 6-26-2004 Dr. Rogers suffered what was th ought to be a vasovagal syncopal episode 
which was thought by the attending physician (Dr. Attig) to be the result of the combined 
effect of the medications she was then taking. 
 
On 7-7-2004 another cervical spine radiogr aphic study and a ches t study was performed 
and read by Robert Reese, M.D., demonstrat ing no further degenerative changes since the 
4-2-2004 study, but showing the same head tilt to the left. A small improvement in 
extension ROM was also noted. Th e chest study was unremarkable. 
 
On 7-13-2004 another cervical MRI was unde rtaken and read by Dr. Lee. It was 
compared to the one performed on 4-2-2004. It showed mild left foraminal stenosis at C3-4 and some osseous ridging/disc bulge at T3-4 and T4-5, but was otherwise not 
dissimilar to the earlier study.  
 
Dr. Rogers underwent cervical epidural ster oid injection by Bennet Davis, M.D. on 7-22-
2004. The epidurogram indicated coverage from C4 to T1. Dr. Rogers underwent cervical 
facet nerve block of C3-C6 on the le ft by Bennet Davis, M.D. on 7-29-2004. 
 
On 8-24-2004 a barium swallow test was performed to evaluate dysphagia. It was reported as a normal study. 
 
On 9-22-2004 Dr. Rogers had a whole body bone scan which demonstrated a markedly increased uptake on the right in  the lower cervical spine in the approximate region of the 
C5-6 or C6-7 facet joints, representing eith er traumatic or degenerative changes. There 
was also a tiny focus of increased uptake at a bout C3-4 with the same  possible etiologies. 
 
On 10-4-2004 a CT study was conducted of the cervical spine by John Anthony Lee, 
M.D., a neuroradiologist. It demonstrated canal  stenosis of C5-6 and C6-7 secondary to 
broad-based disc osteophyte complexes, excentr ic to the left. There was also left sided 
foraminal narrowing at C4-5 and moderate le ft and mild to moderate right foraminal 
narrowing at C5-6, with minimal left forami nal narrowing on the left at C6-7; changes 
secondary to facet joint and uncovertebral joint changes. There was also a broad-based 
osteophyte causing mild central canal stenosis at C6-7. There was no evidence of acute fracture injury. The study was compared to the 7-14-2004 MRI. 
 
On 11-22-2004 Robert Berens, M.D. performed a cervical epidural steroid injection. 
 
On 12-1-2004 Dr. Lenard underwent an epid ural steroid injection by Dr. Berens. 
 
On 12-13-2004 Dr. Rogers underwent cervical medi al branch block on the right side from 
C4 though C6, by Alan Bullock, M.D. He had the impression that she was suffering from cervical degenerative disease ands secondary  mysofascitis and secondary occipital 
neuralgia.

On 12-20-2004 Dr. Rogers underwent cervical me dial branch block on the right side 
(levels not specified) by Alan Bullock, M.D. 
 
On 12-27-2004 and again on 1-24-2005 Dr. Rogers underwent cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation (rhizotomy), C4-C 6 on the right, by Alan Bullock, M.D. 
Indications and diagnosis listed were intractable neck pain an d degenerative joint disease. 
On this date there is another cervical spin e radiographic study (four-view) with flexion 
and extension demonstrating mo re restriction than in the previous study of 7-7-2004. This 
was reported by Dr. Bain. No evidence of instability was noted. 
 
On 2-22-2005 Dr. Rogers had an MRI of her TM joints which showed anterior displacement of the right disc in the closed  position which recaptures with opening with 
joint fluid in the upper space and mild spurring of the condyle. The report also noted that she had developmentally small mandibular cond yles and condylar fossae. The left joint 
was normal. The report was from Kim Burroughs, M.D. 
 
On 6-30-2005, Dr. Rogers filled out an Oswe stry Questionnaire, which was graded as 
44% disability. (Note that the same docume nt also bears a 6-30-2001 date, which was 
presumably an error.) A Neck Disability Inde x (NDI) was also filled out, using the 2001 
date.  The NDI score was 42% disability. There were two other such questionnaires dated 6-7-2005, demonstrating 21% disa bility and 56%, respectively. These appear to come 
from Desert Palms Physical Therapy. A report by Bruce Franke, Jr., P.T., M.Sc. 
described severely limited ROM and additi onal findings of thoracic outlet syndrome, 
which were also noted in Dr. Franks’ report). 
 
During most of the post-injury phase, Dr. Lenard has been seen by Debra Walter, M.D., who has apparently overseen her care and has,  on numerous occasions, injected trigger 
points of the suboccipital, trapezial, and scapular areas with anesthetics and steroid medications. She has also been treated by physic al therapists (Bruce Franks and Adrienne 
Parry), an acupuncturist (Steve  Liu), and a chiropractor (T errence Gehrkin); all with 
temporary, marginal, or zero lasting effectiveness.  
 
She has also been treated on a number of occasions by Stephen J. Harkens, D.D.S., P.C. who has injected her TMJ and has prescribed TMJ splints. He first saw her early in 
March of 2004. 
 
On 1-19-2005 Dr. Rogers was seen at VAX D Medical Group for evaluation and 
treatment. Cervical spine ROM was initially  severely limited: flexion to 10 degrees, 
extension to 15 degrees, rotation to 20 degr ees bilaterally, and lateral flexion of 10 
degrees to the right and 13 de grees to the left. Orthopaedic and neurological tests were 
performed normally. Susan Flemming, M.D. wa s the physician of record there. This is 
where Dr. Rogers had some treatment by Terr ence Gehrkin, D.C.  She was seen through 
April of the same year and final ROM read ings indicated some improvement, but still 
showed marked limitations in flexion (35 degr ees), extension (28 degr ees), left and right 
rotation (23, 35 degrees), and left and right lateral flexion (20, 13 degrees). Dr. Gehrkin 
Kathleen Rogers, M.D. 
Page 6 of 12 
  
commented in his notes that the restricti ons  were involuntary and due to shortened 
muscles and tendons. 
 
On February 8, 2006, Kenneth J. Hansen, D.C., reviewed plain films of the cervical spine, correlating them to the videofluoros copic examination performed by Lance Cohen, 
M.D. on 5-19-2005 for Debra Walker, M.D. Dynamic neutral posture of the cervical spine is hypolordotic from C2 through C4, w ith a mild head forward posture. Minimal 
reduction of the C5-6 disc space is noted with mild degenerative changes there. He noted mild (1+) hypomobility from C0-C1 through C4-5 except at C2-3 where is it 0 to 1+, noting that this is not describe d in Dr. Cohen’s report, although it is consistent with plain 
film analysis. The extension motion is a relatively normal 2+ throughout. No abnormal apophysial joint motion is noted. Mild right latera l deviation is noted in  the sagittal plane. 
Degenerative changes are noted at C4-5 and C5-6. Hypomobility is visualized in right 
(1+) and left (0 to 1+) sidebending (i.e., lateral flexion), with redu ced rotational coupling 
in the mid-cervical spine. Full neck rotation to the left and right is reduced 1+.  
 
Prior to the collision, Dr. Rogers was in good health. She had an appendectomy just prior 
to the collision and did have a history of mi graine headaches which she claims were well 
controlled with Inderal. She also had a hi story of endometriosis, for which she had a 
hysterectomy and oophorectomy in about 2002. After the injury the headaches intensified. They have improved somewhat as  of the time of her deposition in January 
2006, but according to her testimony, she sti ll wakes with severe neck pain and 
headaches, frequently necessitating the use of Frova. She estimated that she has four to five mornings per week with a migraine h eadache. A the time of her deposition, she was 
taking Oxycodone, Inderal, Kadian, Neurontin, Frova, and Colace.  
 
She recently had another epidural steroid in jection from Dr. Bullock, according to her 
deposition transcript. The effect of these in jections reportedly la sts only about three 
months. She suffers from a rather marked constipation, probably as a result of the 
narcotic drugs she takes for pain control. Th e neck pain has plateaued over the past six 
months. She continues to have difficulties with her TM joints with pain and a closed lock 
of 37 mm, as well as with swallowing. Dr. Harkens has apparently recommended she go 
back to wearing the TM joint orthotic a ppliance. Karel De Leeuw, D.D.S., M.D. 
described her condition in April of 2005 as a “severe soft tissue inju ry with debilitating 
internal derangements of her TM  joints . . .” and opined th at degenerative changes would 
likely result and that surgery mi ght eventually be necessary. 
 
She also has a gradually worsening upper back  pain with upright positions which appears 
to be concentrated in the left subscapular  region. This can extend into the left upper 
extremity. This can be as severe as an 8 or  9 in a scale of 0-10. Her paresthesia has 
stopped in the past 6 months, although she c ontinues to have a sensation of aching. She 
noted that when having her hair done, she ha s to be placed in a kneeling position, rather 
than the traditional head back position.

Dr. Rogers uses a wide rearview mirror when driving. She spends a lot of her day “on the 
couch.” She claims that she is unable to work  in her usual capacity as an internist as a 
result of her neck and back pain. 
 
Opinions 
 
Dr. Rogers experienced a rather severe acceleration/dece leration injury on March 11, 
2004 when her 1989 Cadillac Deville was struck from the rear by a 1997 Ford F-100 pickup truck, experiencing a delta V of approximately 12 to 13 mph. The critical forces and loads that her sp ine would have been subjected to would have been compression, 
tension, shear (both anterior  and posterior), and rearward and forward bending. This 
occurs over a period of about 120 msec, or a little more than a tenth of a second. In the 
process she experienced injury chiefly to the cervical spine and TM joint. My diagnostic 
impressions are as follows: 
 
1. Chronic moderate to severe cervical sp ine pain secondary to a combination of 
ligamentous and disc injury secondary to  acceleration/deceleration motor vehicle 
crash (MVC) injury of 3-11-2004. This is generally present u pon awakening most 
days and is relieved to some degree by rest, hot showers, and medications. 
2. Chronic recurrent moderate to severe thor acic region pain, secondary to #1. This 
pain is highly activity- and posture-dependent. Normal upright activity 
precipitates the condition. 
3. Chronic recurrent migraine type headach es. While there was a history of these 
headaches, the motor vehicle crash of 3-11-2004 has greatly aggravated them. 
They occur several days per w eek and are managed as is #1. 
4. Chronic internal derangement of the right TM joint, with closed lock. This is secondary to acceleration/decele ration MVC injury of 3-11-2004. 
5. Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, treated surgically, secondary to 
acceleration/deceleration MVC injury of 3-11-2004. 
6. Trigger thumb, treated surgically, appears to have been precipitated by wearing a 
carpal tunnel syndrome brace. 
 
I would not expect Dr. Rogers’ spinal c ondition to improve over time and, to the 
contrary, would rather expect her spinal degenerative stat e to worsen with time. The 
progressive changes in the spine will include loss of disc he ight, advancing facet arthrosis 
and advancing spondylosis. This is likely to  further reduce the potential canal size 
because existing osteophytic complexes will expand and further compromise the already narrowing foramen at several levels. Eventuall y, this encroachment at the foraminal level 
may produce radiculopathy and n ecessitate surgical intervention. Advancing spinal canal 
stenosis may also eventually necessitate decompression surgery if myelopathy ensues. These changes, however, will only transpire ov er several to a dozen years or more.  
 
Meanwhile, Dr. Rogers has had the benefit of virtually all of the non-invasive modalities 
known to be effective for these kinds of in juries including physical therapy, massage, 
Kathleen Rogers, M.D. 
Page 8 of 12 
  
acupuncture, and chiropractic treatment. She has apparently ob tained limited relief at best 
from these modalities. It is not anticipated that  further therapy will likely benefit her. She 
has also been exposed to the more common invasive procedures such as multiples of facet anesthetic blockade, epidural steroid in jections, trigger point injections, injections 
into the TM joint, and radiofrequency rhizotom y at multiple levels in the cervical spine. 
In some cases, she’s had as many as three or more procedures; again, usually with only transient relief.  Rhizotomy is a destruc tive procedure in which sensory nerves are 
essentially destroyed thermally  using high frequency radio waves. These can regenerate, 
however, necessitating secondary or tertiary procedur es later on. The long-term 
consequences of this procedur e in terms of spinal biomechanics is not fully known at this 
time, but could involve motion abnormalities or dyschronies in these joints and an 
acceleration of degenerative changes.  
 
She may still be a candidate for surgical intervention but, at the present time, her 
neurological status is reasona bly good, so the indications would have to be based not on 
neurological compromise (although that may be an issue in the future) but on discopathic 
pain, and this would require discographi c confirmation of concordant pain and 
morphological changes. This indication for surg ery is somewhat controversial, but would 
probably take the form of a bilevel fu sion from C4 to C6, with or without 
instrumentation. It may be an option Dr. Rogers should investigate further with a 
neurosurgeon or orthopaedic surgeon. 
 
The TM joint derangement is very unlikely to resolve spontaneously, and in my experience, will also not respond other than temp orarily to a bite app liance if the disc is 
not in fully synchronous with the condyle in this very specialized joint. The MRI shows 
that it is not and this implies a tearing of the posterior attachment  tissue. It might be 
possible to get some measure of success with lavage, but I would conc ur with De Leeuw  
that surgery may ultimately be necessary. 
 
Reasons for Opinions 
 
A number of known risk factor s are present that may explai n a more difficult recovery 
and poor outcome in a low velocity collision. These include female sex (1, 2), being unaware of impending collision (3, 4), rear im pact vector (5), use of seat belts and 
shoulder harness (2), history of headache (6 ), middle age (7), pre-existing degenerative 
changes in the spine (8), in itial limitation of cervical RO M (9), immediate onset of 
symptoms (9), etc. The fact that the pickup truck is a larger vehicle and that they tend to 
be relatively stiffer than passenge r cars is also significant. Special risk factors in this case 
include a developmentally small spinal canal and developmentally small condyles and 
fossae at the TM joint. However, in the case of the collision between the Cadillac and the 
Ford pickup, this would not be classified as a low speed collision, but rather—in the 
special context of a rear impact collisi on—as a high speed collision, assuming one draws 
a dichotomous line at about a 10 mph delta V. Dr. Yamaguchi commented in his report 
that the threshold for human subjects in cr ash tests was about 7-8 mph. Although I do not 
Kathleen Rogers, M.D. 
Page 9 of 12 
  
disagree with his overall assessment of this case,  the literature reports this threshold to be 
actually from 2.5 mph (10) to 5 mph (11-14). A nd it is important to realize that, despite 
the popularity of this notion, no such threshol d for human tolerance is known, nor can it 
be established from crash testing (15, 16). No r do these authors I have  referenced actually 
suggest that their results can be  taken as a proxy for injury risk or surrogate for tolerance. 
These have been the interpretations of others. In fact, rather severe injuries can occur at 
lower level accelerations that are typically recorded in even 5 mph delta V collisions 
(16). By the time the crash speed is as high as 15-20 mph delta V, fr actures, dislocations, 
and spinal cord injuries  are not uncommon (17).  
 
Rather than rely, as many experts do, on the so-called “thresholds” or “tolerance levels” 
some believe have been established in these small crash test studies referenced above, it 
is preferable, for a number of reasons, to rely on real world epid emiological studies. 
Firstly, they describe the effects on real  human subjects under real crash conditions. 
Crash test studies, using huma n volunteers, are limited in their external validity, or 
potential for extrapolation to real world cras hes. The volunteers are non-representative of 
a large portion of real world subjects and the crash conditions are non-representative to a large proportion of real world crash scenarios. Secondly, these real world studies can involve larger numbers of re presentative (i.e., non-volunteer) persons which allows us to 
use statistical analytical  methods. These can’t be used in crash tests studies. Most of the 
crash test studies conducted to date, for ex ample, have used healthy male volunteers. 
Males are known to have half the risk for in jury of females (1).  What the most recent 
studies have actually shown is  that 5.1 mph is the mean
 delta V in crashes in which real 
world subjects are injured (18). Others have reported similar results (19).   
 
I have also consulted with the NASS data base and concur with Dr. Yamaguchi’s 
assessment that the NASS case #188003324 does indeed match the crash of Dr. Rogers’ vehicle quite well and that the delta V was probably in the range of 12 to 13 mph. Figure 
1 is a photograph of Dr. Rogers ’ vehicle after the collision. Figure 2  is a photograph of 
the subject vehicle in NASS case #188003324. This would be consistent also with my 
experience in crash testing. Dr. Yamaguchi noted in his report that th e acceleration of the 
vehicle in a crash such as this would be as  high as 13 g (13 times the force of gravity). 
Subject head accelerations will be even higher, with females being higher still than males.  
 
Given the severity of the crash, it is very unl ikely that the cervical facet joints and joint 
capsules were not injured signifi cantly in this crash. It is li kewise likely that the discs 
were injured. The injuries that occur tend to be progressive, setting into motion a degenerative cascade. It is known that discopath ic pain commonly refers pain into the 
shoulders, upper back, and scapula, as can th e facet joints. It does not appear from the 
numerous anesthetic blocks, epidural injecti ons, and rhizotomies perf ormed to date, that 
Dr. Rogers had significant or complete relief  of pain, suggesting that discopathic pain 
contributes to the symptom pict ure. Disc lesions that can produce pain are not always 
visible on CT or MRI (e.g., not all discopathic  conditions are herniations or bulges). For 
example, it’s been shown using discography th at upper cervical discs can produce pain

sensations in the head, craniovertebral junction, and neck, yet there may be no correlation

between disc morphology (as seen on CT or MRI) and the discographically provoked 
response (20). And upper cervical spine injury  is nearly as common as lower cervical 
spine injury in this type of trauma. 
 
The carpal tunnel syndromes were, in my view , directly related to the cervical spine 
injury. These are sometimes called double crush phenomenon injuries. Some pre-existing compression exists in the carpal tunnel, but not enough by itself to manifest in 
symptomatic disease. However, add the insult at the cervical nerve root level, and the combined compression allows the manifestati on of symptoms. This type of outcome is 
not uncommon (21).

SOCIAL HISTORY 
 
Dr. Kathleen Rogers is married and curre ntly lives with her husband. They have no 
children. Up until the time of her motor vehicle crash (MVC) she was self-employed in her own medical practice, specializing in intern al medicine. As a result of the injuries 
sustained in that MVC she has been unable to  continue in her usual occupation and is 
currently fully disabled. 
 
 
MEDICAL HISTORY 
 
Dr. Rogers related to me that she has had a relatively athletic life. She’s had several 
fractures to her left upper extremity related to sports and a pelvic fracture from skiing. 
None of these left her with any residual problems. She did have a single episode of 
significant back pain while on vacation in 2000, but other th an that, she has not been 
bothered with significant spinal pain in the past. 
 
Kathleen Rogers, M.D.

HISTORY OF INJURY 
 
The details of the motor vehicle collision were provided in my report of 3-6-2006. In 
brief, Dr. Rogers had come to a stop, or n early complete stop, af ter which her car was 
struck from the rear by a pick-up truck in a high speed rear impact collision of 12-13 mph 
delta V. As a result of ongoing neck and b ack pain, along with other complaints, she 
became progressively less able to work in her usual capacity as a physician and, after 
attempting to run her practice through a locum tenens  arrangement, she sold her practice 
and has not worked since that time. Subse quently, Dr. Rogers has been evaluated and 
treated by a number of specialis t and surgeons, as well as a chiropractor, a dentist, an 
acupuncturist, and physical therapists. She has had a number of epidural injections, facet anesthetic blocks, and radiofrequency rhizotom ies directed toward the cervical spine, 
with generally only transient relief.  
 
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS 
 
She currently takes Kadian for pain and Neurotin for nerve pain. She also takes oxycodone for breakthrough pain related to the Kadian, and she takes morphine sulfate 
IR. She also takes methocarbamol, AcipHex, Zelnorm, and Xenical. She takes Inderal for migraine prophylaxis and abortive  medications (Frova or Axert)  as needed for headaches. 
 
 
CHIEF COMPLAINTS 
 
Original complaints in the aftermath of the MVC in 2004 included neck and upper back pain, and pain into the left s capular region. She also had poste rior and anterior neck pain 
and an extreme degree of neck stiffness. This was worsened by most motion or work 
activity and relieved somewhat with medica tion and rest. The pain was moderate to 
severe in intensity a nd essentially constant. 
 
She also complained of pain with swallowing by 1st or 2nd day. She had difficulty with 
saliva, food, and liquids. This was positional:  usually encountered in the process of 
moving to a reclining position or  getting up. It was also paro xysmal. She noticed that her 
neurotomy and epidural injections in the neck seemed to help with this. 
 
Dr. Rogers had TM joint pain, right sided. W ithin a couple of weeks she noticed locking 
of the jaw, especially during talking on phone, usually when lying down on her back. 
Kathleen Rogers, M.D. 
Page 4 of 15 
  
She’s had upper and lower bite splints; now uses only the lower splint but doesn’t wear it 
every day.  
 
She also complained of left arm, indicating the C5-6 dermatome region. This was accompanied by burning in the upper back/shoulder bilaterally, but more on left. This pain was less defined back then; mostly an ac he. She also had pain in lateral forearm at 
the midpoint. She occasionally had loss of s uperficial sensation over lateral arm and 
forearm. This came and went, but was not relieved by her rhizotomy, although it was relieved by the epidural steroid/anesthetic in jections and anesthetic blockade. This was 
described as slight in severity and was intermittent. 
 
She complained that she had thoracic pain that occasionally wrapped around to the front 
in the lower ribcage in the mi d-clavicular line. There was al so left scapular pain. This 
happened one time in 2004 and lasted a week, forc ing her to be recumbent due to pain the 
whole time. She has had a couple of flares since then, usually lasting 1-2 days. She’s not sure if it is related to her scapular pain. 
 
Her current chief complaints, as of 6-6-2006, we re that she wakes in the morning with no 
back pain, but has significant (severe) neck pain and extreme stiffness there. Since her rhizotomy this pain is moderate in severi ty. Within 15 minutes this symptoms abates 
somewhat. After a few hours the left scapular/th oracic pain begins to build in intensity 
and the left arm symptoms appear to be related. Occasional movement produces sharp 
pain. Sleeping in awkward position can precip itate her symptoms. She uses a cervical 
pillow and they bought a motorized bed. She also has her car equipped with special 
mirrors to reduce her need to turn her head while driving. Symptoms are relieved to one 
extent or another by rest and various combinations of narcotic medications. 
 
She has left arm pain which she believes mi ght have become somewhat worse since she 
had BoTox injections making her back muscles weaker. This pain is moderate at worst 
and its frequency depends on activity, it be ing worse with increased movement.  
 
She has bilateral burning pain in the trapezi us region. This is usually left sided and 
usually coincides with back rather than neck  pain. Provocative and palliative factors are 
as above. It is slight to moderate a nd occurs now about 2-3 times per week. 
 
She continues to have bouts of TM joint pain and dysfunction. Sh e wears her appliance 
intermittently; usually when it flares, which is about 2-3 time per week. If she eats chewy food she has problems. She believes she has limited opening. Severity of discomfort is 
slight to moderate, but the pain is only par oxysmal. A steroid injec tion did help. She also 
uses a topical cream containing baclofen. She has up to 2 episodes of TM joint pain per 
day.  
 
Self-assessment as of today (% improvement):

1. HA; initially got worse after 2 months. Better after rhizotomies. 50-75% better 
now. 
2. Neck: not much improvement. 
3. Upper back: not much improvement. 
4. TMJ: locking is gone, but d ecreased ROM; pain improved. 
 
 
 
ADDITIONAL REVIEW OF RECORDS 
 
I reviewed a report from Jon Abbot, M.D. dated 4-13-2006. He reviewed the medical record which was essentially the same as I reviewed in my 3-6-2006 report. Dr. Abbot 
was somewhat doubtful of the connection between the MVC and CTS and could not 
understand why Dr. Rogers has not made better progress. He posited that she might benefit from a gradual increase in physical activity a nd a reduction in narcotic 
medications and concurred with  Dr. Tamm and myself that further conservative care 
would probably not be helpful. He also was not of the opinion that surgery would be 
helpful. 
 
I did review the deposition of Harry Tamm, M.D., but I did not see a report. I also 
reviewed the report of Lidi a Artiola, Ph.D. dated 4-27-2006. She administered a number 
of psychometric tests and came to the conc lusion that Dr. Rogers was suffering from 
“chronic pain disorder” without signs of symptom magnification or malingering. 
 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
 
General 
 
Dr. Rogers appeared as a well nourished 51-ye ar-old woman in no acute distress. She is 
right hand dominant. I did notice, when I approached her in the reception area, that she lifted her head with obvious cer vical spine guarding. She is 5 ft 10 in tall and weighs 135 
lb. Blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, pulse  was 80 BPM. Ophthalmoscopic and 
otoscopic examination were unremarkable. Dr . Rogers informed me that she had taken 
Kadian (50 mg) and MS-IR (15 mg) within the last two hours or so. 
 
Head and Neck 
 
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact. Specifically, c onfrontational an d extraocular 
movements were normal despite a positive Romberg test. Accommodation and reactivity

to light was also preserved. Examination of th e TM joints revealed a closed lock, with 
approximately 32 mm of opening. Laterotrusion was approximately 5 mm to the right and 
6 mm to the left. The protrusive pathway was about 6 mm. No significant deviation or 
deflection was noted. A right-sided click was noted upon opening and tenderness over the right condyle was observed. I also heard a fine cr epitus over that joint with the bell of the 
stethoscope and this is indicativ e of perforation of the disc.  
 
Neurological 
 
Romberg was grossly abnormal, but heel-to-sh in and heel-toe coordination was normal. 
Deep tendon reflexes were 3+ in the tri ceps and knees bilaterally, 1+ at the ankle 
bilaterally, and 2+ elsewher e with no evidence of clonus. Sensory examination was 
normal to light touch and pinprick. Pathological  reflexes were not elicited; toes were 
down-going. Superficial reflexes were not teste d. Tinel’s and Phalen’s tests were normal, 
even with challenge. Healed scars were ev ident over the palmer aspect of both hands 
from prior carpal tunnel release surgery.  
 
Orthopaedic 
 
Range of motion in the majo r joints of the upper and lower extremities was normal and 
painless. Straight leg raising did not elicit back or lower ex tremity pain. The Roos test 
was negative. Tenderness to pa lpation was noted pa raspinally in the cervical and upper 
thoracic regions bilaterally, with some asym metry at several levels. I did not note any 
trigger points or induration, but deep muscle hypertonicity was evid ent in the cervical 
spine. Tenderness was also noted over the left  scapula with hyperton icity evident in the 
rhomboid, levator scapula, and infra- and supr aspinatus muscles. Squat, heel walk, and 
tow walking were performed without effort. 
 
Ranges of motion in the cervical spine were record ed using the JTech TrackerTM  (JTech 
Medical, Salt Lake City, UT ), a digital co mputer interface utili zing wireless dual 
inclinometry. Figure 1 is a ba r chart of the age- and gender-normalized expected vs. actual 
ROMs in the 6 standard degr ees of freedom based on regre ssion equations developed by 
Youdas et al. from a large ag e-stratified study of asymptoma tic and atraumatic male and 
female subjects (1). The green (left most) bars represent the statical probable range of the respective motions for a 51-year-old uninjured  normal female. The red (middle) bars 
represent the statistical mean of the actual  measured ranges I recorded during my 
examination of Dr. Rogers, and the blue (right most) bars indicate percentage of deviation 
(in this case loss) of ROM fr om the expected. All measured  ranges fell with in acceptable 
ranges of coefficient of variation indicating a credible effort. This  method of assessing 
patient veracity has been shown to be more sensitive than the AMA Guidelines 
methodology (2). Cervical ra nges of motion are significantly  diminished in all ranges. 
 
Kathleen Rogers, M.D. 
Page 7 of 15 
  
Range of motion in the thoracic spine was not tested due to the degree of motion disturbance found in the cervical region. Ra nge of motion in the lumbar spine was 
roughly within normal ranges, but digital tes ting was not performed. Muscle strength in 
the cervical spine was tested using the JTech Tracker
TM  (JTech Medical, Salt Lake City, 
UT) system. Cervical spine muscle strength av eraged 9.9 lb in flex ion and 15.3 lb in 
extension with a strength ratio  of 1.55:1. Rotation was symm etrical averaging 11.8 and 11.6 
lb left and right, respectively. Figures 2-4 illustr ate these curves. It is noteworthy that they 
are reproducible and associated  with a low coefficient of va riation indicating an honest 
effort. Weakness in the upper extremities vari ed with some muscles (shoulder horizontal 
abductors and wrist extensors) showing a left sided weakness and others (elbow flexors and 
shoulder abductors) showing a right sided weakness. Grip strength using the JTech 
TrackerTM was symmetrical with the right side ha ving 130% of expected strength and the 
left 85%. However, the right side showed significantly more  fatigue than the left in 
sustained tests. Digital algo metry was conducted and demonstrated go od repeatability and 
normal pain thresholds. This would indicate a cr edible reporting of pa in threshold and no 
sign of symptom magnification.

SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY  
 
Dynamic surface electromyography (sEMG) was performed on th e day of the examination. 
After the skin surface was prep ped, electrodes were placed over the sternocleidomastoideus 
muscles and paraspinal muscles, with partic ular attention paid to precise symmetrical 
placement, and Dr. Rogers was taken thro ugh a standard kinematic montage which 
consisted of repeat flexion-neutral-flexion, left  and right latera l flexion, and cervical rotation 
to the left and right. After sufficient warm-up, recording were  made in all ranges. Dynamic 
flexion reveals a lack of symm etry in the paraspinal musculature and asymmetric amplitude, 
with evidence of hyperirritabilit y on the left, Figure 5. During lateral fl exion, the paraspinal 
groups were grossly dy sconjugate, again indicatin g a lack of symmetry  and hyperirritability, 
Figure 6 (top). During rotation, the left paraspinal musculat ure appear hyperirritable, Figure 
7. Variances of this magnitude and type are not found in no rmal necks. The findings are 
consistent with chronic neck pain with asymmetrical motor control.

WEIGHT-BEARING FUNCTI ONAL MRI (C-SPINE) 
 
On 6-6-2006 a weight-bearing, functional MRI of the cervical spine was obtained in 
neutral, flexion, and extension, Figures 8 and 9. The study was read by John Cutrone, 
M.D. and I concur with his findings and a ssessment. Findings of significance were as 
follows:

1. C3-4:  2.0 mm broad-based disc protrusion effacing the spinal cord and narrowing 
the canal. Bilateral encroachment of the ne ural foramina with impingement of the 
exiting C4 nerve roots. This protrusi on increases to 3.0 mm in extension.  
Bilateral degenerative facet disease is present. 
2. C4-5:  2.2 mm broad-based disc protrusion effacing the spinal cord and narrowing 
the canal. Bilateral encroachment of the ne ural foramina with impingement of the 
exiting C5 nerve roots. This protrusion increases to 3.0 mm in  extension. Bilateral 
degenerative facet disease is present. 
3. C5-6:  2.8 mm broad-based disc protrusion effacing the spinal cord and narrowing 
the canal. Bilateral encroachment of the ne ural foramina with impingement of the 
exiting C6 nerve roots. This protrusion increases to 3.2 mm in  extension. Bilateral 
degenerative facet disease is present. 
4. C6-7:  2.8 mm broad-based disc protrusion effacing the spinal cord and narrowing 
the canal. Bilateral encroachment of the ne ural foramina with impingement of the 
exiting C7 nerve roots. This protrusion increases to 3.0 mm in  extension. Bilateral 
degenerative facet disease is present.

DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRES 
 
When Dr. Rogers was seen for examinati ons, she completed the SCL-90R, the NDI, the 
LiSat-11, the CAD Symptoms Questionnaire,  the Revised Oswestry, the Problem 
Checklist, and the Whiplash Disability Ques tionnaire. In no case was there any evidence 
of malingering or symptom exaggeration, nor was there any evidence of psychological or 
affective disorder or depression. 
 
 
CT-DISCOGRAM 
 
A discogram was performed on 6-13-2006 by A. Reid Bullock, M.D. Injections under fluoroscopic guidance were made at C4- 5, C5-6, and C6-7. The only level producing 
concordant pain was the C6-7 level and this  corresponded with some posterior extension 
of contrast material. Also noted was a small Schmorl’s note in the inferior endplate of C5 
on the left side. It did not fill with contrast. Posterior extension of contrast appears at this level (C5-6)  as well. Post erior osteophyte complexes are present at both levels.

OVERALL DIAGNOSTIC OPINIONS 
 
1. Chronic moderate to severe cervical sp ine pain secondary to a combination of 
ligamentous and disc injury secondary to  acceleration/deceleration motor vehicle 
crash (MVC) injury of 3-11-2004. This is generally present u pon awakening most 
days and is relieved to some degree by rest, hot showers, and medications. 
2. Chronic recurrent moderate to severe thor acic region pain, secondary to #1. This 
pain is highly activity- and posture-dependent. Normal upright activity 
precipitates the condition. 
3. Chronic recurrent migraine type headach es. While there was a history of these 
headaches, the motor vehicle crash of 3-11-2004 has greatly aggravated them. 
They occur several days per w eek and are managed as is #1. 
4. Chronic internal derangement of the right TM joint, with closed lock and perforation of the disc. This  is secondary to acceleration/deceleration MVC injury 
of 3-11-2004 and is the result of tear ing of posterior attachment tissue. 
5. Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, treated surgically, secondary to 
acceleration/deceleration MVC injury of 3-11-2004. 
6. Trigger thumb, treated surgically, appears to have been precipitated by wearing a 
carpal tunnel syndrome brace. 
 
 
DISCUSSION and PROGNOSI S AND FUTURE MEDICAL 
 
None of the tests conducted by me would suggest any evidence of malingering or 
symptom magnification. Indeed, Dr. Rogers made objectively valid efforts in all tests in 
which that is measurable, including ROM,  muscle testing, gr ip strength, sEMG, 
questionnaires, etc. 
 
As noted in my earlier report, I would not e xpect Dr. Rogers’ spinal  condition to improve 
over time and, to the contrary, would rather  expect her spinal degenerative state to 
worsen with time. The progressive changes in  the spine will include loss of disc height, 
advancing facet arthrosis and advancing spondylosis. Discography and functional MRI 
reveal disc pathology that is  both anatomical and (at C6-7 ) directly associated with 
concordant left scapular pain, which is a predominant feature of her symptom complex. 
These changes can also reduce the potent ial canal size because existing osteophytic 
complexes will expand and further compromise the already narrowing foramen at several levels. Eventually, this encroachment at the foraminal level may produce radiculopathy 
and necessitate surgical intervention. Adva ncing spinal canal stenosis may also 
eventually necessitate decompression surger y if myelopathy ensues. These changes, 
however, will only transpire over several to a dozen years or more.  
 
In revision to comments made in my previous  report of 3-6-2006, I do not believe that 
Dr. Rogers is a good surgical candi date at this time and I say that for several reasons: (a) 
Kathleen Rogers, M.D. 
Page 14 of 15 
  
the discopathic changes are relatively widespread  and affect multiple spinal levels, (b) the 
discographic findings (with the notable excepti on of the C6-7 disc) are not sufficiently 
pain-concordant and do not appear sufficiently grossly abnormal in the absence of a more 
clear-cut neural impingement such that they might otherwise more definitively 
recommend a surgical solution, and (c) Dr. Rogers’ condition has evolved into one in 
which some degree of hypersensitivity of th e nervous system may have occurred (3). My 
opinion is that surgical inte rvention could be a serious mi sadventure at this point.  
 
Meanwhile, I continue to be of the onion that Dr. Rogers has had the benefit of virtually 
all of the non-invasive modalities known to be effective for these kinds of injuries 
including physical therapy, massage, acupunctu re, and chiropractic treatment. She has 
apparently obtained limited relief at best from these modalities. It is not anticipated that further therapy will likely benefit her. She has also been exposed to the more common invasive procedures such as multiples of facet anesthetic blockade, epidural steroid injections, trigger point injections, injecti ons into the TM join t, and radiofrequency 
rhizotomy at multiple levels in the cervical spine. In some cases, she’s had as many as 
three or more procedures; again, usually with  only transient reli ef.  Rhizotomy is a 
destructive procedure in  which sensory nerves are essent ially destroyed thermally using 
high frequency radio waves. These can rege nerate, however, necessi tating secondary or 
tertiary procedures later on. Th e long-term consequences of this procedure in terms of 
spinal biomechanics is not fully known at this time, but could involve motion 
abnormalities or dyschronies in these joints a nd an acceleration of degenerative changes.  
 
The TM joint derangement is very unlikely to resolve spontaneously, and in my experience, will also not respond other than temp orarily to a bite app liance if the disc is 
not fully synchronous with the condyle in this very specialized joint. The MRI shows that 
it is not and this implies a tearing of the poste rior attachment tissue. It might be possible 
to get some measure of success with lavage, but I would concur with De Leeuw  that 
surgery may ultimately be necessary. 
 
Finally, I would concur with Dr. Abbot in that it would be in Dr. Rogers’ best interests to 
very gradually—as her condition permits—ret urn to greater and greater amounts of 
physical activity while gradually weaning hersel f off of her current regimen of narcotic 
medications. Rather than producing a remissi ve effect, such a program would only be 
likely to better forestall an accelerated deconditioning and degenerative process. I 
discussed this gradual increase in activity with her wh en I saw her several weeks ago.

RE:  BARKER, Kenneth

Dear Mr. Goreman: 
 
The following is my evaluation of the motor vehicle crash (MVC) of 8-6-2003 in which 
Mr. Ken Barker was injured. 
 
SOCIAL HISTORY 
 
Mr. Barker is single and descri bed his current occupation as that of a business consultant. 
At the time of the injury he was not  employed, but was doing freelance work. 
 
MEDICAL HISTORY 
 
Mr. Barker denied any serious illnesses, work ers’ compensation claims or other personal 
injuries. He did have an injury  to his ankle in a motorcycle crash some years ago. He also 
saw two chiropractors in Arizona approximately  8 years ago for low back pain treatment. 
He was treated three to four times and this remedied the problem he was then having.  
 
He had been taking Remeron (mirtazapine) for sleep but is not currently taking any 
medications. 
 
HISTORY OF INJURY 
 
Mr. Barker related to me that he was driv ing his 1996 Mercedes Benz S500 and traveling 
at a speed he estimated to be 25-30 mph wh en another car approaching from the opposite 
direction turned left in front of him. This  caused him to slow considerably. A second car 
following the first one to turn in front of him followed it through the intersection and he collided with that car in a frontal type of co llision. At the time of the crash the airbag in 
Mr. Barker’s car deployed and he recalls stri king his shins on the car’s knee bolster. He 
was wearing his restraints. He still has a visibl e mark on his left shin which he attributes 
to the incident. He does not reca ll if he struck the airbag but believes his head struck the 
windshield and broke it. He thi nks he may have lost consci ousness briefly. Mr. Barker 
said he saw the airbag smoke after the cras h and thought his car might  be on fire so he 
quickly got out and then went over to the othe r driver and assisted him out of his car. He

stated that he may have had his head turned to the right and may have  been leaning to the 
right at impact.  
Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Th e police were on the scene shortly after the 
crash. He related that the coll ision occurred in the vicinity of Loma Linda University 
Hospital and that doctors from  the hospital, who were passersby, did briefly talk to him 
and assure him that he was “OK.” He felt confident enough to go ho me after the crash. 
 
The following morning he felt faint and dizzy and had neck and back soreness. He went 
to the Loma Linda Medical Center ER. He ha d a contusion on his left wrist anteriorly 
along with some minor scrapes and cuts on the dorsum of his hand. Radiographs were 
taken of the hand and he was given some medications. Some time later a second set of 
films was obtained of the hand.  
 
Some time later he went to the Loma Linda Family Medical Center and saw a physician’s 
assistant who ordered other radiographs. He saw her in the week or so after the crash and 
was referred there by friends. He saw her on 5 or 6 occasions. She sent him to Loma Linda Medical Center for evaluation of his hea d, but he is not entirely clear on what the 
evaluation was for. He was also seen at  a therapy center fo r rehabilitation.  
 
About two months after the crash, Mr. Barker  was seen by Jeffry Phillips, D.C. at the 
referral of a friend. Dr. Phillips employed various physical therapy modalities and manipulation in his treatment of Mr. Barker. He treated Mr. Barker at a frequency of one to two times weekly and continues to see him on a weekly basis now. He also referred 
Mr. Barker to Neil Chafetz, M.D., and Khalid Ahmed, M.D., for evaluation.  
 
Mr. Barker also went to a dentist named Schrames at th e referral of Phillips. He 
apparently saw him on one occasion. Dr. Schrames recommended that he go to another dentist, which he did not do. He gave Mr. Ba rker a prescription a nd did some tests and 
told him that he had temporomandibular diso rder (TMD). He also gave Mr. Barker an 
appliance to wear at night for managing bruxism. He wore it for a few weeks. 
 
 
ORIGINAL CHIEF COMPLAINTS  
 
Mr. Barker stated that after the crash his w hole body ached and he could not relate which 
area was more painful than another. He had h eadaches, with pain radi ating to the vertex 
and into the frontal region, and he thinks his left TM joint may have been contributing to 
this. This pain was aggravated by working around the house. He was unable to do yard 
work because of it. The pain was describe d as a dull ache becoming occasionally sharp 
and jabbing. It was usually slight in severity becoming moderate or moderate to severe. This occurred daily and lasted about 25% of the day. He also complained of mid to lower 
neck pain which was described as burning and sharp; a muscle pain; “like a karate chop to the neck” This pain was aggravated by th e same factors and ranged from slight to 
moderate in severity, occupying 10-15% of ev ery day. He complained also of daily mid-

scapular pain of slight severity which was c onstant. He complained of mid-back pain that 
was dull burning becoming sharp, slight in se verity becoming occasionally moderate or 
severe on a few occasions, forcing him to lie on his back. This was daily and constant. He 
also complained of  and lower back pain that was dull to sharp, moderate in severity becoming severe on several occasions. It was also  daily at that time. He also complained 
of low back pain which was daily, constant , and  moderate, becoming severe on several 
occasions. He had aching and occasional tingling sensations in his thighs which radiated 
as far as his feet. This was daily and minima l to slight in severity. His left wrist was 
moderately sore for some time due to the hematoma there or the injury that produced it.  He had pain over the sternum which was daily and moderate in severity. He had bilateral 
TM joint pain which was minimal in  severity, daily, and constant.  
 
 
CURRENT CHIEF COMPLAINTS 
 
Mr. Barker currently complains of slight to moderate neck pain which continues to occur 
daily, occupying about 75% of the day. It is  described as burning and occasionally sharp, 
with a feeling of fatigue. He hears crep itus upon motion and feels the that his neck 
motion is jerky. He complained that he has not been able to play basketball or other 
sports since his injury. He has pain in th e cervicothoracic region which is slight in 
severity, daily, and occupies about 75% of the day. This pain radiates down into his 
thoracic region. In the mid- to low back, he has daily pain also, usually slight or slight to 
severe in nature and occurring over about half of each day. There is radiation into the anterior and posterior hip joint and down the right th igh into the foot. He related that he 
spends about 90% of his day in a recliner as a result.  He co mplains that both of his knees 
hurt these days, which he believes may be th e result of general deconditioning. This pain 
is minimal. He also has noticed (and demons trated for me) that hi s sternum actually pops 
when he pushes on it a certain wa y. He has dull to sharp pain of  a minimal severity in the 
left TM joint occasionally. He noticed that af ter the crash his left eye would close when 
he got tired. Now he notices that it droops a li ttle and he has some occasional twitching in 
the muscles surrounding the eye. When asked how he far he has come in terms of recovery to this point, he related that his headaches ar e about 50% improved. Everything 
else he felt was worse. 
 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
 
General 
 
Mr. Barker presented as an alert and pleasant 43- year-old man who appear ed his stated age.  
His height was 6 ft and his weight was 195 lb. Blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg. He is 
right hand dominant. 
BARKER, Kenneth

Head 
 
Tm joint examination revealed tenderness over the left TM joint, ma sseter, and temporalis 
muscles. There was not significant deviation or deflection, kinematically, and no opening or 
closing clicks or pops were heard. Ophthalmoscopic, otoscopic, and oral examinations were unremarkable.  
 
Cervical Spine 
 
Ranges of motion in the cer vical spine were recorded  using the JTech TrackerTM  (JTech 
Medical, Salt Lake City, UT ), a digital computer inte rface utilizing wireless dual 
inclinometry. Based on American Medical Asso ciation expected normal ranges, Mr. Barker 
had 86% of flexion, 55% of ex tension, 51% of left lateral flexion, 62% of right lateral 
flexion, 45% of left ration, and 55% if right rotation. In all cases, calculated coefficient of 
variation (CV) was low, indicating valid test s. Bilateral muscle sp asm and guarding were 
evident, although this was more marked in the left paraspin al musculature. Bilateral mid-
trapezius spasm was also pres ent. Mid-cervical joint moti on was particularly painful, 
indicating either facet injury or disease or disc pathology. Compressio n and distraction tests 
did not produce radicular symptoms. 
 
Thoracolumbar Spine 
 
Ranges of motion in th e lumbar spine were again meas ured using the JTech TrackerTM. 
Again using American Medica l Association guidelines ranges, Mr. Barker’s ranges of 
motion were limited. He flexed  to only 52% of normal; he ex tended to only 52% of normal; 
lateral flexion was limite d to 48% of normal bilaterally. Pa lpation of the pa raspinal region 
evoked complaints of pa in diffusely throughout the thoraci c and lumbar paraspinal regions. 
There was a fairly substantial bilateral musc le spasm present in the lumbar paraspinal 
musculature extending from the up per to lower lumbar region. St raight leg raising provoked 
complaints of lower back pain bilaterally.  
 
Extremities 
 
Grip strength as meas ured by JTech TrackerTM dynamometer set at the second station 
demonstrated a 54% loss in the left hand. Meas ured limb circumferen ces were as follows: 
 
      R i g h t    L e f t

Page 5 of 13 
 
 
  Thigh    16.0 in   16.8 in 
  Calf    14.5 in   14.0 in 
 
Muscle strength, as evaluated by  manual muscle tes ting, was felt to be 5/5 in all groups of 
both upper and lower extremities, with the exception of the left upper extremity which was generally weaker at 4+/5.  Ranges of motion in the major joints of  both upper and lower 
extremities were full and painle ss, with the exception of the right hip, in which external 
rotation elicited some pain. Some evidence for mild im pingement was present in both 
shoulders. There was no evidence of at rophy or deformity. 
 
What appear to be benign essential tremors of the hands were present at a frequency of 
about 5-8 Hz and low amplitude. Mr. Barker indicated a small cres cent-shaped area of 
pinkish coloration over his left leg indicating th at that was a vestige of his collision there 
with the knee bolster. 
 
Neurological Examination 
 
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and equal bila terally in both upper a nd lower extremities.  
Cranial nerves III thro ugh XII were intact and there was no evidence of pathological reflex 
or clonus. Sensitivity to pinprick was preser ved throughout. Romberg’s test was equivocal. 
Mr. Barker complained of dizz iness and unsteadiness. Mr. Bark er is alert, oriented in 
person, place, and time, and ha s a normal fund  of knowledge. 
 
Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire 
 
The total score on the Rivermead instrument  was 46. Mr. Barker reported a moderate 
problem with dizziness, being irritable or easily angered, forgetfulness or poor memory, 
poor concentration, and blu rred vision. He reported severe problems with sleep 
disturbance, fatigue, taking l onger to think, and restlessness. This score indicates a 
significant and intrusive postconc ussion syndrome is present. 
 
Whiplash Disability Questionnaire (WDQ) 
 
Mean score was 7.8 with high scores in the questions sensitive to postconcussion 
sequelae. This instrument again indicates a very intrusive pattern in physical, cognitive, and emotional components, suggesting a high level of disability. 
 
Revised Oswestry Disability Index 
 
Disability score for the low back was 54% indicating severe disability.

Neck Disability Index (NDI) 
 
The NDI score was 56% also indicating severe disability relevant to the neck. 
 
 
REVIEW OF RECORDS  
 
Imaging Studies from Lo ma Linda Medical Center  (CD-ROM) 
 
1. There is a limited (AP and lateral) left  wrist series dates 8-7-2003 and 8-14-2003. 
No fractures or other pathol ogy is visible on these films. 
2. There is a high speed CT scan of the head dated 8-14-2003. There is no evidence 
of osseous fracture of the cranial vault or  facial bones. The brain parenchyma is 
intact and there is no midline shift or evidence of large volume bleeding. 
Ventricles appear normal and midline in position. 
3. There is an AP and lateral lumbar sp ine dated 8-14-2003. There is flattening of 
the lumbar curve, probably due to muscle spasm. There is some indistinct appearance of the facet joint at L2-3 on the left, possibly representing facet joint 
asymmetry at that level. Disc spaces are intact and the study is otherwise normal. 
4. There is a six-view cervical  spine radiographic series (five-view plus swimmer’s)  
dated 9-4-2003. This study shows a nor mal cervical curvat ure with good joint 
spacing. Early mild degenerative changes are present at C6-7 with minimal IVF 
encroachment bilaterally. This is probably not significant at this point. Incidentally noted is a poster ior ponticulus at the atlas. 
 
Report from Michael J. Singelyn, M.D.  Dr. Singelyn saw Mr. Ba rker on or about 4-5-
2005 (the date of his report) and reviewed so me of his medical reco rds. He reviewed a 
number of records from Loma Linda Medica l Center, records from Andrew Hesseltine, 
M.D., records from Rehabilitation Technol ogy Works, records from Khalid Ahmed, 
M.D., and “some MRI reports,” notably those of the cervical and lumbar spines, both 
shoulders, and the left wrist. It is not clear whether he re viewed the film or only the 
reports. Notably, in the cervical spine, he described a left si ded 5 mm “bulge” at C6-7.  
He made no comments regarding records fr om the Redlands Chiropractic Clinic. 
 
Dr. Singelyn was unimpressed with Mr. Barker, outside of an injury to the left wrist. He 
stated with “more than complete medical certainty that this gentleman did not suffer significant injuries to any of  the body parts to which he cl aims.” He reported that Mr. 
Barker’s presentation was characteristic of  malingering and symptom magnification. He 
questioned the diagnosis of postconcussion syndrome based on his belief that no acute concussion occurred. This, he noted, would ha ve required a loss of consciousness (or an 
alteration of consciousness) and neither of these happened in his opinion. It is not clear 
how he came to this conclusion, however, 
 
I reviewed a car rental invoice for $13,200.

Rehab Technology Works, Inc.,  Physical Therapy , report from Mahnaz Kazalbasch, 
P.T. The report is dated 11-26-2003 and descri bed an intake date of 10-6-2003 and the 
fact that continued P.T. is recommended and that Mr. Barker  has made some progress but 
continues to wear a cervical brace and have pain “status quo.” Pain is cervical and lumbar 
with decreased ROM noted. He also comp lains of memory problems and dizziness. 
 
Declaration of Elaine Knolty  Ms. Knolty apparently treated Mr. Barker with deep tissue massage for pain. The bills range from 8-13-2003 through 10-22-2004. Complaints 
include neck, back and h eadache pain, twitching around eyes,  hand tremors, lower 
extremity pain, dizziness, and forgetfulness. 
 
Traffic Collision Report   There is a traffic collision report which describes the crash 
partner vehicle as a 1994 Honda 4-door which was towed from the scene. Both vehicles were said to have major damage. The report describes an “other possible injury” to Mr. 
Barker and “complaint of pain” from the ot her driver he collided with. Mr. Barker was 
said to have “minor abrasions to his left hand, pain in the left hand/arm, and a possible 
head injury.” The other driver was found to have caused the collision by failing to yield right of way. The police diagram of what  appears to be the point of maximum 
engagement depicts the cars together such that the Honda was at about a 35-degree angle to the Mercedes engaging nearly all of the frontal portion of the Mercedes and the right 70% of the front of the Honda and the right front fender to the wheel well. The area of 
impact was indicated as bei ng about a car length back on the roadway such that the 
Honda was pushed back by the Mercedes. 
 
There is a detailed billing of various electrodiagnostic tests conducted on 8-11-2004 
by Mumtaz Ali, M.D. These include multiple nerve conduction velocity tests of upper 
and lower extremities, H-reflex, and needle EMG of the cervical and lumbar paraspinals and extremities. There is also a separate report on these findings which are also described in the report below. 
 
Report of Mumtaz A. Ali, M.D.   This is a neurology report dated 8-11-2004. He 
reviewed the MRI scan of th e cervical spine dated 11-18-2003 [sic] which was read by 
Neil I. Chafetz, M.D. This showed posteri or disc herniations at C5-6 and C6-7, 
measuring 5 mm and 3-4 mm, respectively, both causing left-sided central [canal] 
narrowing (severe and moderate to severe, respectively). The lumbar MRI study, also reported by Dr. Chafetz on the same date, s howed bilateral facet hypertrophy which was 
mild to moderate at both L3-4 and L5-S1, and moderate at L4-5. Mild central canal 
narrowing was noted at L4-5. His examin ation showed a normal mental status 
examination. He also noted bilateral hand tremors which were positional. 
Electrodiagnostic studies were normal. His diagnosis was myoligamentous injury, cervical spine; bilateral positional hand trem ors; myoligamentous injury, lumboscral 
spine, with radicular symptoms into both lower extremities. He noted that mild or intermittent nerve entrapment does not alwa ys result in electrodiagnostic abnormalities. 
BARKER, Kenneth

He remarked that the subjective complaints were consistent with the history and recommended continued orthopaedic  and neurological follow-up.  
 
Report from Khalid B. Ahmed, M.D.   Dr. Ahmed, an orthopaedic surgeon, examined 
Mr. Barker on 7-2-2004 for complaints of head ache, neck pain, tremors, right shoulder 
pain, low back pain, and sensory problems in his left hand and foot. He found restricted ROM in the cervical spine, left shoulder, a nd lumbar spine. The impingement test was 
positive on the left side. He found hypesthesia to L5, no side mentioned, and weakness of 
great toe dorsiflexors; left greater than ri ght. A surgical scar was noted over the right 
ankle. By history this was a surgery in 1993. Right shoulder radiographs reveal AC joint 
arthritic changes. Cervical and lumber radiogr aphs show loss of lordotic curves. (Film 
origins and other details not given.) His diagnoses include d concussion with residuals, 
cervical disc herniation (by MRI), bilateral shoulder impingement syndrome, lateral epicondylitis in the left elbow, mid back st rain, lumbar disc herniation (by MRI) with 
radiculopathy, left greater than right, L5-S1, and old a nkle fracture repair. He 
recommended continued chiropractic care, electrodiagnostic studies, and bilateral 
shoulder MRIs, as well as blood tests. He cons idered epidural steroid injections in the 
future. If that procedure fails, discography a nd possibly spinal surgery are entertained for 
both cervical and lumbar spines. 
 
Photos of Collision Damage and Crash Scene   I reviewed a number of color photo 
images of the two crashed vehicles and the crash scene absent the vehicles. These were 
provided on a CD-ROM. There is a fracture of  the windshield of the Mercedes Benz on 
the driver’s side which would coincide with a blunt force contact from Mr. Barker’s head. 
 
Reports dated 10-31-2003, 12-05-2003, 6- 22-2004, and 3-25-2005 from Andrew W. 
Hesseltine, M.D. Mr. Barker had complaints of h eadaches and some tremors and was 
taking Remeron for sleep. He diagnosed a cervical sprain/strain and postconcussion 
syndrome. At the last visit he still complain ed of neck pain. Cervical facet syndrome was 
added to the diagnosis. 
 
Records from the office of Khalid Ahmed, M.D.  From ABC pharmacy there is an 
invoice for Ranitidine, cyclobenzaprine, ibuprofen, and APAP/codeine.   
 
Advanced Professional Imaging Medical Group. On 8-3-2004 an MRI of the right and 
left shoulders was completed. These studies were read by Sim Hoffman, M.D. The right 
shoulder showed an increased signal in the late ral margin of the rotator cuff, consistent 
with mild tendinitis. On the left there was a relative downsloping of the acromion process consistent with mild to moderate impinge ment. On 9-21-2004 an MRI of the left wrist 
was completed and also read by Dr. Hoffman. There was no evidence of fracture, but the 
“triangular fibrocartilage ” was poorly visualized.  
 
The Dental Trauma Center  In a reported dated 6-24- 2004, Mayer Schrames, D.M.D. 
described his examination of Mr. Barker. In the report, Dr. Schrames reported that Mr. 
Barker was belted and was struck in the face by the airbag, later complaining of pain in

the area of the TM joints, popping, ear pres sure, and headaches, along with numerous 
other complaints probably not related to the TM joints. He found evidence of bilateral internal derangements using Doppler auscultation. He also found abnormalities using 
EMG, although it is not clear whether this entailed a needle examination. His diagnosis 
included capsulitis, myofascial pain, dislocation, and medication-induced xerostomia. He made a dental orthotic for the management of this condition. Approximately one month 
later, Mr. Barker was reevaluated and continue d to have problems with the joint. He was 
told that there was a possibility of a need for surgery in the future. He was told to continue home exercises and to wear the device.  
 
Loma Linda Faculty Medical Offices   Mr. Barker was referred for evaluation of 
memory loss and bilateral hand tremors on 9-4-03. 
 
Loma Linda University Medical Center  On 8-14-2003 the assessment is “status post MVA head trauma with neurological signs—r ule out subdural hematoma.” He was sent 
to the ER for x-rays and a head CCT scan. Complaints include headache, tremors, wrist 
pain, should blade area pain, neck and low b ack pain, left jaw pa in, dizziness/nausea, 
blurred vision, and weak legs. He is give n codeine and anti-inflammatory medications. 
There is also a report from Matthew J. Madde n, M.D. He described the visit and concern 
over a possible scaphoid fracture. Some para spinal tenderness was present. Another 
report described the evaluation on 8-15-2003. This was by Hubert E. Wong, M.D. His diagnosis was postconcussion syndrom e and musculoskeletal strain. 
 
Oracle Imaging Services, Inc.  (Neil I. Chafetz, M.D.)  Dr. Chafetz reports on a cervical 
and lumbar MRI ordered by Jeffry Phillips, D.C. These studies were completed on 11-18-
2003. In the cervical spine he re ported “posterior disc herniations at C5-6 measuring 
approximately 5 mm causing severe left-sid ed central canal narrowing and at C6-7 
measuring 3-4 mm causing moderate to severe le ft-sided central canal narrowing.” In the 
lumbar spine he reported “bilateral facet hype rtrophy which is mild to moderate at both 
L3-4 and L5-S1 and moderate at L4-5. Mild central canal narrowing at L4-5. Five to 6 
mm posterior disc bulge at L5-S1 where there is an anular tear in  the posterior aspect of 
the disc.” 
 
Loma Linda University Medical Center  On 8-7-2003 and again on 8-14-2003, the left wrist was examined with plain film analysis  and interpreted by Richard Tully, M.D. and 
Ingrid Kjellin, M.D., respectively as norma l studies. There was also a limited lumbar 
study on 8-14-2003 which showed straighteni ng of the lumbar lordosis which was 
thought to be either due to spasm or positio ning (Wyatt/Kjellin). Th ere is a report of a 
head CT dated 8-14-2003 and read by David Alvarez, M.D. This was interpreted as a 
normal scan of the head. There is a radiology report of the cervical  spine dated 9-4-2003 
and read by Shaila Philip, M.D. The impre ssion given was that of  a normal spine with 
“multilevel cervical spondylosis particularly involving C5-6  and C6-7 without evidence 
of fracture.”

Redlands Chiropractic Clinics (Jeffry W. Phillips, D.C.)  Mr. Barker was first seen by Dr. Phillips on 10-23-2003. I have reviewed numerous records including billing and 
intake, as well as examination documents. Mr . Barker was complaining of headaches, 
spinal pain in the neck and lower back, as well as wrist pain and memory problems. He 
also complained of pain in the shoulder blades. 
 
Jamie Kowal, D.C., D.A.C.B.R.   Mr. Barker was examined using “motion x-ray” of the 
cervical spine on 4-2-2005. This  is essentially a videofl uoroscopy (VF) study. Reported 
findings included a loss of cervical lordosis , spondylosis from C5-C7 and a posterior 
ponticulus. There was some loss of range of motion (ROM) in lateral flexion, bilaterally, 
in the mid cervical spine. Lateral bending revealed some lateral excursion of the atlas on the atlas which Dr. Kowal indicated might be indicative of alar and accessory ligament injury. She also performed a motion study of the TM joints finding no apparent 
pathology. No tracking errors were  noted. (It should be noted that VF is not the definitive 
study for the evaluation of the TM joints and internal disc derangements are best imaged 
using MRI.) 
 
 
Crash Analysis 
 
Examination of photographs of the car driven by Mr. Barker reveal a ra dial glass fracture 
defect in the windshield with up to an inch of more of external bowing, consistent with 
head strike.  
 
 
OVERALL DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS 
 
1. Chronic, grade 4 (whiplash) cervical d eceleration injury secondary to motor 
vehicle crash 8-6-2003. Probable ligamentous injury. 
2. Posterior disc protrusions at spine levels C5-6 and C6-7 secondary to motor 
vehicle crash 8-6-2003. These lesions have produced referred pain and symptoms 
into the upper extremities. 
3. Chronic headaches secondary to motor vehicle crash of 8-6-2003. 
4. Mild traumatic brain injury and concussi on secondary to blunt force contact with 
windshield in motor vehicle crash 8-6-2003. 
5. Ongoing moderate-level postconcussi on syndrome secondary to #3 above. 
6. Essential tremor of the hands, bilaterall y, probably secondary to mild traumatic 
brain injury. 
7. Chronic thoracolumbar pain due to moto r vehicle crash 8-6-2003 and complicated 
by/contributed to by #1 and #2 above. 
8. Disc protrusion at L5-S1, 5-6 mm with anul ar tear in the poste rior aspect of the 
disc, secondary to motor vehicle cr ash, 8-6-2003. This lesion has produced 
referred pain and symptoms into the lower extremity. 
BARKER, Kenneth

9. Left sided probable TM joint derangement secondary to blunt force contact with 
windshield in motor vehicle crash 8-6-2003. 
10. Left sided shoulder impingement and right shoulder tendinitis, probably 
aggravated by motor vehi cle crash of 8-6-2003  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Mr. Barker impresses me as the kind of person who attempts to be thoroughly explicative. He described his life and his symptoms alike in great detail. As a result, my 
interview of him and examination of him t ogether took three hours. This is always 
challenging for an examiner. However, this pe rsonality type should be distinguished from 
that of a malingerer. Dr. Singelyn and I di sagree on that point. Dr. Singelyn, in fact, 
discounted all but the hand injury as potentially resu lting from the crash in question. It is 
not clear from reading his report whether he actually saw the MRIs or simply read from 
the reports. He characterized the MRI protrusi ons (herniations) as “ bulges.” At one point, 
Dr. Chafetz also used that term. Terminol ogy has been standardized by the American 
Spine Society, the American Society of Sp ine Radiology, and the American Society of 
Neuroradiology, which was further endorsed by the Joint Section on Disorders of the 
Spine and Peripheral Nerves of the American  Association of Neurological Surgeons and 
Congress of Neurological Surgeons [1]. With in the constructs of this vernacular, a 
“bulge” is a symmetric deformity not exceedi ng 3 mm. The lesions Mr. Barker’s cervical 
MRI demonstrate would be described in this le xicon as “protrusions,”  the preferred term 
now for herniation.  
 
Mr. Barker claimed to be wearing his seat belt and shoulder harne ss at the time of the 
crash. This is the state of the crash describe d consistently in all of the records I have 
reviewed. It is possible for retractor mechanis ms and locking pawls to allow a few inches 
of belt spooling before fully engaging the we bbing material, and this could have occurred 
in this case, allowing enough forward excurs ion to result in head  contact with the 
windshield. I did observe Mr. Barker in this  vehicle in his normal driving position and 
note that he sits rather close to the steeri ng wheel. Thus, it would not require more than 
one to two inches of spooling to allow head  contact with the wi ndshield. The photos of 
the windshield illustrate the typical star pattern of fracture with about an inch of external bowing of the class. This windshield damage  is consistent with the forces known to 
produce cerebral concussion [2 ]. The kinematic and biomech anical effects of this 
collision with the windshield are very high compressive loading of the cervical spine 
often combined with an element of neck exte nsion. These forces would be consistent with 
disc injury and ligamentous injury in the n eck. Tensile injury to the lumbar spine would 
have occurred simultaneously owing to the restra ining effect of the seat belt. This would 
explain his lower back pain. His lumbar disc protrusion is consistent with this mechanism 
of injury.  
 
BARKER, Kenneth

Hand tremors are an uncommon, but not rare, re sult of mild traumatic brain injuries and, 
because these often occur in conjunction with whiplash type injuries, they have been 
reported following both types of injuries [3]. Periorbital (eye) fasciculations of the orbicularis oculi muscle are the result of irritation to the facial nerve, which is a cranial nerve that may have been effected by th e initial mild traumatic brain injury. 
 
The MRI of the shoulders reveal a left-sid ed impingement mechanism that would have 
predated the motor vehicle crash. However,  subclinical impingements are common in 
middle aged persons and frequently beco me symptomatic, along with tendinitis, 
following motor vehicle crash injuries [4]. 
 
His chronic headaches are almost  certainly related to his ne ck injury, but probably also 
have an element of posttraumatic headache to them, following the mild traumatic brain 
injury and concussion. 
 
 
PROGNOSIS AND FU TURE MEDICAL 
 
Mr. Barker’s condition is permanent and sta tionary at this time. Generally, when 
postconcussion symptoms last longer than six months, they do not improve significantly 
beyond that time. The disc protrusions in his neck act to destabilize the neck 
kinematically and will themselves progressively  degenerate. This destabilization results 
in instability, which may have been comp licated by ligamentous injury. Although his 
current level of symptoms do not warrant surgic al intervention, the more severe of these 
protrusions (C5-6) may protr ude progressively with time or  fragment, necessitating the 
need for surgery. However, that intervention would be complicated because of the adjacent protrusion which would undergo acceler ated degeneration or further protrusion 
as a result of the superior level operative fixation. Thus, a tri-level fusion (i.e. from C5 to C7) with plate fixation would probably be a sound approach should surgery become 
necessary in the future. At present, I do not  have enough information to make predictions 
concerning the TM joint. This does not appear to be one of Mr. Barker’s more significant 
problems at present. The hand tremors are not likely to resolve. His shoulders are stable 
and will not require any definitive treatment in the foreseeable future. His neck pain back 
pain can continue to be treated by his chir opractor and this will provide ongoing relief. 
Because of the injuries to the cervical and lu mbar spines sustained in this motor vehicle 
collision, Mr. Barker will be a chiropractic patient for life, regardless of whether or not surgery is needed in the future.

Dear Mr. Greenman: 
 
The following is my evaluation of the motor vehicle crash (MVC) of 6-11-06 in which 
Ms. Mychael Stecktol was injured. 
 
Social History 
 
Mr. Stecktol is married and is currently em ployed by Pavilion (Safeway) grocery store as 
a checker. She worked in this capacity also at the time of her MVC. She is a non-smoker 
and uses alcohol moderately.  
 
Medical History 
 
Ms. Stecktol had a Baker’s cyst removed from  one of her knees about 20 years ago. She 
has been involved in two prior motor vehi cle collisions (MVC). In 1981 she was the 
driver of driver of 1980 280 ZX when another person, traveling in the opposite direction, 
made left hand turn in front of her. They co llided in a head-on type  of crash. She was not 
restrained in that collision. There was no airbag deployment. Her car was reportedly 
declared a total loss. She sustained a boxer’s  fracture to her right hand, but no other 
significant injuries. In 1997 she was driver  of 1989 Toyota Camry station wagon and was 
involved in a very similar type  of frontal crash, with anothe r person turning left in front 
of her. Again there was no airbag deployment and the vehicle was declared a total wreck, 
reportedly sustaining major frontal damage. Sh e was restrained in this collision. She was 
taken by ambulance to hospital where she believes they obtained radiographs. She was given a prescription for Tylenol with codein e. At the time she recalls having had chest 
pain, knee pain (they hit bolster), and neck pa in: all of this in anterior areas. She had 
nausea and dizziness within a day or two, and numbness in both arms. She saw Rodney 
STECKTOL, Mychael 
Page 2 of 7 
 
Shelley, D.C. She was given chiropractic tr eatment, PT modalities, massage, and was 
encouraged to take up yoga. She still practices yoga to this date. She treated with Dr. Shelley for about five months. She was off work  on disability for some five months. Ms. 
Stecktol mentioned that she first saw Dr. Sh elley about 1987 for general health care. She 
saw him for maintenance care thereafter, but for no specific of significant problems. She 
did see him after she was released from active care for the MVC, back on the 
maintenance program, maybe once every 6 w eeks. When Shelley retired, Mark Kennedy, 
D.C., took over for him so she saw him thereafter on the same ~1 time every 4-6 weeks maintenance program. Ms. Stecktol briefly also saw a Tommy Hewko, D.C. in Costa 
Mesa, also for maintenance care. 
 
Ms. Stecktol is otherwise me dically healthy, but does take various over-the-counter 
(OTC) medications for her various musculos keletal complaints. These include aspirin, 
ibuprofen, Advil, and Aleve. She takes these every couple of days, usually one dose of 2 
tablets, but occasionally up to 6 tablets per day. 
 
History of Injury 
 
Ms. Stecktol related that she had come to a stop at an intersection. The light was red and 
she was behind other cars that were also st opped for the traffic signal. There was some 
road construction on the road and it had reduced  three lanes of traffic to one lane. When 
the light turned green and she was waiting to precede, the cars in front of her having not 
moved yet, she suddenly heard tires sounds a nd then felt an impact. She felt she was 
thrown first forward and then back into the seat. She believes her head struck the head 
restraint. No were no second coll ision with vehicles in front of  her. As to the question of 
awareness, Mr. Stecktol relate d that she heard huge screech  and looked toward the rear-
view mirror, concerned that she was going to be hit. She may have tensed up in 
anticipation. She relate d that after the collision her sunglasses were on passenger side 
floor. She did not lose consci ousness. Police arrived on the sc enes and a report was made. 
She was given a ride home by a tow truck driver. After the collision she felt shocky and weak and began to feel stiffness in her neck and back by the following day. She did 
attempt to work that day but left after two hours or so due to increasing discomfort. She 
was seen by Mark Kennedy, D.C. on the Monday following the crash. 
 
Review of Records  
 
Ms. Stecktol was also later seen by Richard J.  Claveria, M.D. (orthopaedic surgeon) on 
February 10, 2005 for evaluation at the request  of Mark Kennedy, D.C. At the time she 
was not complaining of any upper extremity ra diation of symptoms. Range of motion in 
the neck was significantly limited in flexion, extension, and lateral rotation bilaterally. 
Lumbar range of motion was limited in all ra nges but rotation. Dr. Claveria reviewed a 
videofluoroscopic (VF) study of the cervical spine dated 9-11-2004, which was interpreted by Jamie Kowal, D.C., D.A.C.B.R. This showed lateral translation of C1 on C2 indicative of alar ligament damage. It also demonstrated “alor dosis” of the cervical

spine consistent with ligament damage/m yospasm, along with a general reduction in 
motion. Dr. Claveria’s impressions  were (1) cervical strain, (2) lumbar strain, and (3) 
ischial tubercle bursitis. Further co nservative treatment was recommended. 
 
A final report of Robert M. Kennedy, D.C. dated December 27, 2004 was reviewed. He described the rear impact collision in which Ms. Stecktol was restrain ed and had her head 
turned somewhat looking into the rearview mi rror. In addition to neck, shoulder, and low 
back pain, she was also complaining initia lly of blurred vision, fatigue, nausea, and 
tinnitus. Dr. Kennedy’s report summarizes a numbe r of abnormal tests re lative to the left 
shoulder, muscle strength limitations in the neck and upper extremities, and limited ranges of motion in the cervical and lumbar spines. She also had some weakness in her 
lower extremities. He ordered the VF study on 8-14-04. Findings were as noted above. 
His impressions were (1) cervical accele ration/deceleration (CAD) injury with 
ligamentous instability, (2) cervical radiculitis, (3) cervicocranial syndrome, (4) left shoulder strain with tendinitis, (5) chronic lumbar strain/sprain w ith mysofascitis. All 
were attributed to the MVC of 6-11-04. At the time of his report, he considered Ms. 
Stecktol to have reached a point of permanency. 
 
I have reviewed a report from Jamei Kowal, D.C., D.A.C.B.R. regarding the above referenced VF study. The comments in Dr. Claveria’s report echo the report by Dr. 
Kowal. 
 
Original Chief Complaints 
 
In the aftermath of the collision, Ms. Steck tol related having the following complaints: 
 
1. Neck pain: lower posterior radiating into  mid traps and anterior shoulders and 
down the back to the buttocks, bilaterally, greater on the right side. This pain also 
radiated into occipi tal region and up the back of her head. This pain began within 
48 hours of the collision. Provocativ e factors included forward bending, 
prolonged angled postures, and back  bending. Palliative factors included 
chiropractic manipulative ther apy (CMT), massage, the use of ice packs, rest, and 
Ibuprofen, 1600 mg/d. The pain was sharp a nd burning and moderate in severity. 
It was then constant and daily. 
2. Headaches: This pain began within 48  hours of the collision. Provocative and 
palliative factors are as de scribed above and include k eeping her eyes closed. The 
headaches were described as an intens e pressure and mode rate in severity, 
occurring daily for the first month, gene rally lasting about half of the day.  
3. Thoracolumbar pain: chiefly felt more in th e trapezius regions. Onset, provocative 
and palliative factors are as described a bove in #1. Yoga also helped. She started 
this after the first month. The pain was de scribed as a dull ache and radiated into 
the right posterior thigh to the knee. This was described as slight to moderate in severity in the back and the leg and, o ccasionally, the leg pain was greater than 
that of the back. This pain was da ily, occupying about half of the day. 
 
STECKTOL, Mychael 
Page 4 of 7 
 
Current Chief Complaints 
 
Ms. Stecktol’s current complaints are as follows. 
 
1. Neck and trapezius are pain in the same locations as described above. This pain is made worse with prolonged activity be yond four hours and progresses from dull 
to sharper. It is relieved somewhat by yoga, CMT, rest, sitting down, and OTC 
medications. There is some radiation into the upper extremities, especially the right. She complains of occasional num bness during the day and every night, 
when she is recumbent, she has numbness in both upper extremities. This is made worse by sleeping on her back. Most of th e time during the work week, the pain 
level is minimal to slight, but it becomes moderate after a few consecutive days at work. On days she does not work, there might be no pain. 
2. Mid-thoracic and lumbar spine pain. Pr ovocative and palliative factors are as 
above. The pain is described as dull to burning and sharp, radiating into the right 
buttock and posterior thigh. This pain in creases with shift work and the numbers 
of consecutive days of work. The severity  is described as minimal to moderate, 
with leg pain usually less than the lo w back pain. She has no bowel or bladder 
problems. She has this pain 4-5 days of the week. 
3. Headaches occur after consecutive days of  work in the same area as described 
above. Provocative and pallia tive factors are as desc ribed above. The headaches 
start as dull ache and a sense of pressure gradually increases, always in conjunction with neck pain. The pain is desc ribed as slight to moderate in severity 
and the headaches typically occur in the 3
rd through 5th day of the work week.

Crash Analysis 
 
Although the crash partners were not available for direct inspection, co llision severity can 
be estimated qualitatively. A number of crashes involving Volvo vehicles struck from the rear are available for review from the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS). 
This is a database of collisions that have b een investigated by trained investigators, with 
velocity changes (delta V) estimated by computer  analysis of crash data. Relevant in this 
case are data relating longitudinal change in ve locity to crush depth. Higher velocities are 
associated with greater height, width, and depth of crush. The most representative of 
these with respect to th e subject crash is NASS case ID: 166005294, vehicle ID: 
166213148, which is a 2001 Volvo Series 70 station wagon, weighing 3593 lb, ID 
number YV1SZ58D31, which struck from the rear by a 1999 Chevrolet Suburban 
weighing 5886 lb, ID number 1GNGK26J0X. Th e computer generated delta V of the 
Volvo was 10 mph. This is the most representati ve of the crashes in terms of structural 
damage with respect to the St ecktol Volvo. Unlike the Stecktol  vehicle, the Volvo in the 
NASS database was not towed from the scene. A photo of this vehicle is shown in Figure 
1. I reviewed two other similar rear impact NASS cases involving Vo lvo station wagons 
in which crush depth, width, and height were significantly less that of the Stecktol crash. 
In these crashes, the calculated  delta V was reported as 7-9 mph.

STECKTOL, Mychael 
Page 6 of 7 
 
Based on this computer reconstruction and the similarity to the Stecktol crash, and because the software used by NASS has been recently shown to underestimate delta V by 
approximately 20% in the majority (77%) of cases [1], it is likely that the Stecktol crash delta V was approximately 10-12 mph.  
 
I am in possession of a black and white copy of photograph of the rear of a Volvo station wagon bearing the California license plate number 3KEJ610 which corresponds to that 
given in the Long Beach Police report. The photo was taken from the rear and to the 
right, demonstrating damage to the bumper, rear door assembly, and sheet metal above 
the bumper. The tail lights are poorly visualized  in this photo. I have reviewed this police 
report of the collision, written by Officer K. C. Quaak. Officer Quaak’s representation of 
property damage is notably inaccurate inasmu ch as it depicts damage to the left rear 
quarter panel of the Volvo rather than direc tly across the rear as is evident from the 
photo. This vehicle was towed. The vehicl e striking the Volvo was a 1997 GMC Sonoma 
pickup truck, which was also towed from the scene. Depending on the model, these trucks weigh from 4000 to more than 5000 lb. The 1994 Volvo SW 850 station wagon has a curb weight of 3400 lb. 
 
We have conducted full scale crash tests in this range of collision speeds at the Spine 
Research Institute of San Diego. The target vehicle in this case was a stationary 1987 
Chrysler Le Baron, which has head restraints of similar design and geometry to those of 
the 1994 Volvo 850, and the bullet vehicle was a 1994 Ford Crown Victoria traveling at 
14.4 mph. The Le Baron’s delta V was 10.1 mph. Using the highly biofidelic BioRID IIe 
anthropometric test dummy in, we recorded head linear (x) acceler ation peaks of 24.9 g 
in that crash test. The recorded vertical (z ) acceleration was 15.8 g, w ith pelvic linear (x) 
acceleration of 15.7 g and pelvic  vertical (z) acceleration of  28.0 g. The calculated Neck 
Injury Criterion (NIC) was 40 m2/s2 which is well in excess of the published threshold for 
serious neck in jury of 15 m2/s2 [2]. It is noteworthy th at the BioRID IIe is a 50th 
percentile male dummy weighing 175 lb, whereas Ms. Stecktol is a 79th percentile female 
and females generally experience much larger  head acceleration than  males based on our 
tests and those of others [3-5]. The forces  and loads experienced  by Ms. Stecktol would 
have exceeded SAE J885 standards and would have subjected her discs, ligaments, and  joints capsules to very high shear strains and compressive and tensile loading.

Dear Sir or Madame: 
 
On August 28, 2006 I had the opportunity to ex amine Ms. Rallsaff in connection with 
ongoing complaints she continues to have arising out of a motor vehicle collision (MVC) 
which occurred on October 18, 2004. The follo wing is a summary of my findings and 
recommendations. At the end of this report, which was originally sent in September to 
Ms. Rallsaff’s lawyer, please see an adde ndum report which discusses the current 
situation and addresses, specifi cally, Department of Social Se rvices concerns per page 2 
of form MEF IP1 (04/06) in your letter to me dated November 28, 2006. 
 
SOCIAL HISTORY 
 
Ms. Rallsaff is divorced and currently is a st udent in a nursing progr am. At the time of 
her injury she was employed as a cashier at  Rite Aid, full time, and had been working 
there for about one and a half years. She is  divorced and has two children who are not 
currently living with her. 
 
MEDICAL HISTORY 
 
Ms. Rallsaff underwent breast reduction surgery at approximately age 19. She has had two Caesarian sections (1990 and 1996). She also had a tubal ligation and an appendectomy in close proximity to each ot her approximately four years ago. She has 
had pneumonia twice; once in about 2000 and th e second time last December. Otherwise, 
her history is uneventful a nd non-contributory. Specifica lly, she denies any prior 
significant injuries to her head, neck, or bac k. She also denies any significant complaints 
in her neck or low back prior to th e MVC of 10-18-04. She has been seen by a 
chiropractor in the past, sporadically, for general maintenance-type care. She has had approximately 20 treatments in her life. Sh e denies any significant current health 
problems other than her musculos keletal complaints and asthma.

HISTORY OF INJURY 
 
Ms. Rallsaff related that she was driving he r 1993 Ford Thunderbird and had come to a 
stop at a traffic signal behind several other cars. Her car wa s then struck suddenly from 
the rear by another vehicle. She was not aw are of the impending crash. She was wearing 
her seat belt and shoulder harness. She does not recall the position of  her head restraint 
but does not ever recall adjusting it. Sh e does not know whether any deformation 
occurred to the seat back because she did not  drive the car after th e crash; it was driven 
away later by her boyfriend. Sh e does not recall whether she st ruck any parts of the car’s 
interior during the cras h, noting that “The w hole day is a blur.” She does not believe she 
lost consciousness. Police responded to the scene and Ms. Rallsaff was later transported 
in full spinal precaution to Scripps Memorial Hospital, Encinitas. She experienced immediate pain in the lower back. She believ es she also had immediate pain in her neck 
as well. At the hospital she was gi ven medication and a cervical collar. 
 
She later went home and slept.  About two days later she wa s seen by her primary medical 
doctor, Sheryl Long. She saw her only on one occasion. Approximately one to two weeks later she was referred to Kelly Gibson, D.C. who treated her with standard chiropractic 
therapy which included manipulation, PT modalities, and therapeutic exercise. This therapy continued through a bout March of 2005 and was helpful on a temporary basis. 
 
ORIGINAL CHIEF COMPLAIN TS (aftermath of injury) 
 
1. Her initial chief complaint was that of a constant headache which she described as minimal to slight in severity. It was globa l in nature and felt like a dull ache. It 
was helped somewhat by medication and rest. 
2. Her secondary initial compla int was that of lower back pain which was constant 
and minimal to slight in severity. It  was also relieved only somewhat by 
medication and rest. It was al so described as a dull ache, but there was no initial 
radiation. 
3. She also complained initially of neck pain which involved her entire posterior 
neck. It was constant, minimal to slight in severity, described as a dull ache, relieved by medication and rest to some  degree, and was initially non-radiating. 
 
CURRENT CHIEF COMPLAINTS (8-28-06) 
 
1. Currently Ms. Rallsaff complains most of low back pain which varies in severity from minimal to severe and is constant . Nearly every day it eventually becomes 
severe. Provocative factors include standing for more than 5-10 minutes and lying on her back. Sitting is palliative to a degree. The pain is  described as a dull ache. 
RALLSAFF, Susan 
Page 3 of 16 
  
She notes that it has become much wors e over the past few months, but is not 
aware of any specific triggering events other than the MVC. She now also has 
radiation of pain into bot h feet with numbness and tingling. The radiation is down 
the posterolateral thigh and down into the feet. 
2. She continues to have posterior neck pain  which radiates up into the skull base 
and is worsened by tension. It is relieved somewhat by rest. It is now described as 
a sharp pain and she has tingling sensations  in the first three digits of the left 
hand. The pain is minimal in severity and is present only occasionally. 
3. She also continues to have headaches whic h she does not relate to her neck pain. 
They occur 2-3 times per week and can la st up to 24 hours. She self-treats with 
aspirin and Aleve prn. These are slight in  severity and described as a constant 
ache. 
 
I asked Ms. Rallsaff to describe her overall progress since the origin al injury two years 
ago. She related that her headaches have diminished about 90%. Her neck pain has diminished abut 70-90%, but her lower back pain is worse and her leg pain in a new 
feature associated with the worsening low back pain. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
 
General 
 
Ms. Rallsaff presented as a h ealthy appearing 46-year-old wo man who appeared her stated 
age. She is 5 ft 4 inch es in height and weighe d 190 lb. She is left ha nd dominant. Pulse was 
60 bpm and blood pressure wa s quite low at 85/6 5 mmHg. Ms. Rallsa ff was in slight 
obvious discomfort during the examination, which lasted approximately two hours. Towards 
the end of the examination, she was not able to stand without some support and was in very 
acute discomfort due to lower back pain.  
 
Head 
 
Ophthalmoscopic and extraocular examin ation was unremarkab le, although rapid 
movements of the eyes were not smooth in al l directions, indicating some loss of smooth 
pursuit. Accommodation and light adaptation wa s normal.  TM joints appeared normal and 
non-tender. 
 
Neurological 
 
Ms. Rallsaff conversed normal ly and possessed a good fu nd of knowledge and was 
normally expressive. Cranial nerves II through XII were intact with the exception of smooth 
RALLSAFF, Susan 
Page 4 of 16 
  
pursuit as noted above. Deep tendon reflexes were all 2+ and equal bilaterally, with the 
exception of the right ankle which was 1+. There was no eviden ce of clonus and toes were 
downgoing. There was no evidence  of long tract disease. Bala nce was preserved, gait was 
normal, and she was able to squat and toe- and heel-w alk without difficulty . Tinel’s test was 
positive on the left and equivocal on the right . Phalen’s test was negative bilaterally. 
Sensation to light touch and pin prick was pres erved throughout except for the left great toe 
and right lateral foot where it was diminished. These findings are indicative of radiculopathy 
involving the L5 and S1 nerve roots. 
 
Orthopaedic 
 
Supine straight leg raising produced thigh pain b ilaterally at 45 degrees.  It also increased the 
sensation of right lateral foot  numbness. Manual muscle tes ting revealed normal strength 
throughout, although testing of the right lower extremity provoked sciatic-like pain. 
Palpation paraspinally revealed isolated tender ness over the lumbar ar ea in the midline and 
extending into the paraspinal musculature bilate rally, and over the sciatic notches bilaterally. 
Some increased muscle tone was found bila terally in the middle  trapezius muscles. 
Circumferential measurem ents of the extremiti es were as follows: 
 
      R i g h t    L e f t  
 
  Arm    11.0 in   11.5 in 
  Forearm   9.25 in   9.25 in 
  Thigh    18.5 in   19.0 in 
  Calf    17.0 in   17.0 in 
 
 
Ranges of motion (ROM) in the cervical spine were record ed using the JTech TrackerTM  
(JTech Medical, Salt Lake City, UT), a dig ital computer interface utilizing wireless dual 
inclinometry. Figure 1  is a bar chart of the age- and ge nder-normalized expected vs. actual 
ROMs in the 6 standard degr ees of freedom based on regre ssion equations developed by 
Youdas et al. from a large ag e-stratified study of asymptoma tic and atraumatic male and 
female subjects (1). The white bars repres ent the statical probabl e mean range of the 
respective motions for a 46-year-old uninjured normal female. The gray bars represent the 
statistical mean of the actual measured ranges I re corded during my examination of Ms. 
Rallsaff, and the dark gray bars indicate percentage of deviation (in this case loss) of ROM from the expected. This method  of assessing patient veracity  has been shown to be more 
sensitive than the AMA Guidelines methodology (2). Cervical extensio n, left rotation, and 
right lateral flexion we re notably diminished.

Figure 1.  Cervical spine ROM as compared to normative data from Youdas et al.  
 
 
Because of her current acute low back pain st atus, I did not use an instrumented lumbar 
ROM assessment and, instead, use a traditi onal method of active range of motion. Ms. 
Rallsaff was able to get her fingertips to with in 5 inches of the floor in flexion, but was 
limited in extension due to back pain. La teral flexion and rotation were executed 
normally.   
 
Extremities 
 
Range of motion in the major jo ints of the upper an d lower extremities wa s full and painless. 
Maximum grip strength was meas ured using the JTech TrackerTM (JTech Medical, Salt Lake 
City, UT) dynamometer set at th e second station. No major side-to-side variations were 
noted. 
 
Digital algometry was measur ed using the JTech TrackerTM pressure transducer (JTech 
Medical, Salt Lake City, UT). The average pressure tolerance over the lower cervical region 
indicated a tolerance which was within normal clinical ranges. 
 
SURFACE EMG STUDY 
 
I performed dynamic surface electromyogr aphic (sEMG) examination on 8-28-06. 
During flexion relaxation and re turn to neutral posture, no rmal activation patterns were 
observed. With rotation of the neck, however, the signal from the left paraspinal muscle 
RALLSAFF, Susan 
Page 6 of 16 
  
group was consistent with reduced activation, Figure 2 . This pattern was also observed 
during lateral flexion of the neck, Figure 3 . These are findings that are not seen in 
persons with non-symptomatic necks. Sp ecifically, these patterns have been 
demonstrated to distinguish between indivi duals suffering from whiplash injury and 
healthy controls (3-6). This technology has become well established for its sensitivity to 
muscle activation (7) and as a common obj ective diagnostic and outcome measure in 
whiplash research (8-13), and is poised to  become the standard for determining the 
validity of claims in the future (14). I di d not measure the sEMG activity in the lower 
back because the adipose tissue was too thic k to obtain strong signal in this case.

OUTCOME QUES TIONNAIRES 
 
CAD Symptoms Questionnaire  This is a questionnaire developed by me which is based 
on clinical and epidemiological literature and assesses the veracity of a patients’ complaints within the framework of  common, less common, and highly unlikely 
symptoms relating to cervical accelerati on/deceleration (CAD) trauma. Mr. Rallsaff 
endorsed only three items of 33, all of which belong to the “common symptoms” group, 
indicating that symptom magnifi cation or malingering is not a likely factor in this case. 
 
Neck Disability Index (NDI)   The NDI, which has been validated in a whiplash 
population and has become the standard outco me assessment tool for this condition (15-
17), indicated 32% disability resulting from cervical spine-related symptoms.  
 
Revised Oswestry Disability Index  Ms. Rallsaff currently has more disability related to her lower back and this is consistent with a disability score here of 52%. The revised Oswestry is also a well-validated outcome  assessment tool for lower back related 
disability. 
 
Impact of Event Scale   This scale examines the impact of the events (injury) on the 
individual’s life in terms of psychological intrusion or a voidance items. Ms. Rallsaff 
RALLSAFF, Susan 
Page 8 of 16 
  
endorsed only three items as being “rarely”  present and the remainder as “never,” 
indicating that it is very un likely that psychological factors play any signif icant role in 
her current neuromusculoskeletal complaints.  
 
LiSat-11  The Life Satisfaction-11 assessment also  indicated that no significant overlying 
issues of depression are complicating the clinical picture in this case. Ms. Rallsaff endorsed high levels of satisfaction in all di mensions except, as w ould be expected, “my 
physical health.” 
 
SCL-90-R   The System Checklist-90 Revised is a well established and validated 
instrument for assessing the psyc hological health  of individuals. It ha s also been shown to 
be sensitive to the type of chronic pain found in persons with whiplash injuries and to be 
capable of distinguishing between real patien ts and persons faking an injury (18-21). Ms. 
Rallsaff’s score fell well within the normal range on all dimensions except that of somatisation, which, consistent with the cited studies, is elevated because of 
neuromusculoskeletal compla ints, indicating that she is  not making any attempt at 
symptom magnification or malingering, and also indi cating that there are no 
psychological factors complicat ing the clinical picture.  
 
IMAGING STUDIES 
 
MRI Studies  A cervical spine MRI was obtained at  TRUE MRI on 8-28-06 in weight-
bearing and dynamic flexion/extension pos itions. This study was interpreted by John 
Cutrone, M.D. His impressions were: 
 
1. Grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis, C2. 
2. 17 degree scoliosis in the cervical spine with apex at C6. 
3. C2/3: subtle concentric disc bulge th at effaces the theca l sac. Bilateral 
encroachment of the neural foramina. Bilateral degenerativ e facet disease. 
4. C3/4: 2.2 mm broad-based disc protrusion/os teophyte encroaching the thecal sac. 
Bilateral encroachment of the neural foramina. Bilateral degenerative facet 
disease. 
5. C4/5: 2.2 mm broad-based disc protrusion/os teophyte encroaching the thecal sac. 
6. C5/6: 3.2 mm broad-based disc protrusion/osteophyte encroaching the thecal sac and narrows the spinal canal. There is bilateral encroachment of the neural 
foramina with impingement of the exiting C6 nerve roots. There is no change in 
protrusion with motion. 
7. C6/7: 3.2 mm broad-based disc protrusion/osteophyte encroaching the thecal sac and narrows the spinal canal. There is bilateral encroachment of the neural 
foramina with impingement of the exiti ng C7 nerve roots. Degenerative facet 
disease is present on the right. 
8. C7/T1: subtle concentric disc bulge that effaces the th ecal sac. Bilateral 
encroachment of the neural foramina.

I have reviewed this study and concur  with Dr. Cutrone’s interpretations.  
 
A lumbar MRI was obtained at TRUE MR I on 8-28-06 in weight-bearing and dynamic 
flexion/extension positions. This study was interpreted by John Cutrone, M.D. His 
impressions were: 
 
1. L1/2: subtle concentric disc bul ge that effaces the thecal sac. 
2. L2/3: 3.3 mm broad-based disc protrusion that effaces the thecal sac.  
3. L3/4: 3.3 mm broad-based disc protrusion that effaces the thecal sac. There is bilateral encroachment of the neural fo ramina with impingement of the exiting 
left L3 nerve root. This protrusion incr eases to 4.0 mm in extension. Bilateral 
degenerative facet disease with ligamenta flava hypertrophy. 
4. L4/5: 2.9 mm broad-based disc protrusion th at effaces the thecal sac and narrows 
the spinal canal. There is bilateral encr oachment of the neural foramina with 
impingement of the exiting right L4 nerve root. This protrusion increases to 3.8 mm in extension. Bilateral degenerative  facet disease with ligamenta flava 
hypertrophy. 
5. L5/S1: disc desiccation and an 8.5 mm cen tral disc protrusion that impinges the 
thecal sac and the transiting L5 and S1 nerv e roots. The disc protrusion is causing 
significant spinal canal stenosis. There is  bilateral encroachment of the neural 
foramina with impingement of the ex iting right L5 nerve roots. Bilateral 
degenerative facet disease with ligamenta flava hypertrophy. 
 
I have reviewed this study and concur  with Dr. Cutrone’s interpretations. 
 
Radiographic Studies  A 7-view cervical spine series, including flexion and extension 
views, was obtained at TRUE MRI on 8- 28-06. This study was interpreted by John 
Cutrone, M.D. His impressions were: 
 
1. Degenerative disc dis ease, C5/6 and C6/7. 
2. Neural foraminal encroachment, right C2/3, left C5/6 and C6/7, and C7/T1 
bilaterally. 
3. Uncovertebral arthrosis, left C5/6  and C6/7, and C7/T1 bilaterally. 
4. Facet arthrosis, right C2/3 and left C5/6. 
5. Postural changes. Left convexity with apex at C5 and alordosis. 
 
I have also reviewed these films and would concur with Dr. Cutrone ’s interpretations. I 
would also add the following observations: 
 
1. The head is held in a head forward posture. 
2. This is a relatively rare example of congenital dysplasia of the spine (see 
DISCUSSION).

An 8-view lumbar spine seri es, including flexion and exte nsion views, was obtained at 
TRUE MRI on 8-28-06. This study was in terpreted by John Cutrone, M.D. His 
impressions were: 
 
1. Mild degenerative disc disease, L5/S1. 
2. Spondylosis, L2/3 through L4/5. 
3. Postural changes. 
4. No evidence of tran slation with bending. 
 
I would concur with Dr. Cutrone’s interpretations. 
 
REVIEW OF RECORDS 
 
I have reviewed a report from Jamie Kowel,  D.C., D.A.C.B.R. on a videofluoroscopic 
(VF) study of the cervical spin e she performed on 11-1-04. Sh e reported a loss of cervical 
lordosis, 5 mm of translational motion betw een C2 and C3, and degenerative changes. 
 
I have reviewed a report from Newport Family  Medicine (Beth Grive tt, P.A. and Sheryl 
Long, M.D.) dated 10-19-04. An examination was then apparently normal with the exception of tenderness over entire back, paraspinally, and in the traps. Ms. Rallsaff was being treated there for asthma, allergic rh initis, obesity, depression (treated with 
Lexapro), an abnormal PAP smear, and abdom inal pain of unknown etiology. She was 
placed on work disability until the 25
th of October. I asked Ms. Rallsaff how long she had 
used Lexapro and she told me that  she had used it for a few months. 
 
I have reviewed the report of Kelly Gibson, D.C. dated March 31, 2005. She made 
diagnoses that included cervical, thoracic, a nd lumbar sprain and strain, thoracic outlet 
syndrome, traumatic brain injury, hip strain, and cervical neuritis. On her final visit on 
March 31, 2005, Ms. Rallsaff was not complainin g of any pain related to the MVC of 
October 2004. An NDI completed on that day showed 0% disability. A Revised Oswestry 
also showed a 0% disability score on that date. This was also the case on March 7, 2005 
and February 28, 2005. These were significantly  elevated, however, in November 8, 2004 
showing 68% disability due to back pain and 80% disability due to the neck pain. 
 
I reviewed a Traffic Collision Report dated 10-18-04. The car that struck Ms. Rallsaff 
was described as a 1998 Lexus. Damage to  both cars was described as minor. The 
collision was described as a straight, colinear one. Ms. Rallsaff complained at the scene 
of neck and back pain. The striking driver st ated that she was traveling at about 8 mph 
upon contact.  
 
I reviewed a repair estimate from Ocean  Paint & Body Shop da ted 3-29-05. Repair 
estimation for this 1993 Ford Thunderbird included replacement of the bumper cover and some paint work at $971.80. I also review ed a GEICO San Diego estimate for this

vehicle dated 11-9-04 which recommended the same type of repair (total cost not 
provided on the document). 
 
I have reviewed color photo copies of th e rear of a Ford Thunderbird (CA license 
5GNH333) which depicts an apparent inco mplete bumper overriding (based on black 
smudge marks on the superior aspect of the Ford rear bumper fascia. There are also several marks on the rear portion of the fascia  in the centerline consistent with rear 
impact loading. 
 
I reviewed a radiographic repor t concerning an examination of the right shoulder (two 
views) and cervical and lumbar spines (three views each) dated 10-18-04 from Scripps Memorial Hospital, Encinita s (note subject’s name here  is Susan Schledwitz). 
Osteoarthritic changes in the cervical and lumbar spines are mentioned by radiologist 
Zachary Rattner, MD. 
 
I reviewed the report of a CT examination of the cervical spine dated 10-18-04 from 
Scripps Memorial Hospital, En cinitas (note subject’s name here is Susan Schledwitz). 
This is a study without contrast and is r ead by James Davis III, MD, as “negative for 
fracture.” Degenerative changes are mentioned to be mild. 
 
ER records from Scripps Memorial Hospital indicated that Ms. Rallsaff was transported in full spinal precaution and that her (lower back)  symptoms began at the crash scene. 
The diagnoses were cervical and lumbar st rain, right shoulder c ontusion, and she was 
prescribed Vicodin and Motrin. 
 
I reviewed the Carlsbad Fire Department Pr ehospital Run document which indicated neck 
pain as the primary complaint. However, at the hospital, both lower back and neck pain 
(and right shoulder pain) were ma jor complaints according to triage notes. A report from 
Jerry Cunningham, MD, noted that she had imme diate onset of neck and back pain upon 
getting out of her car. 
 
OVERAL DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS 
 
1. There is a very significant 8.5 mm disc pr otrusion (i.e., herniation) at the L5/S1 
level resulting in an L5 sensory radiculopathy on the left and an S1 mixed sensory 
and motor radiculopathy on the right. These are the probable end re sult of injuries 
sustained in the MVC of 10-18-04. 
2. Multi-level lesser protrusions are present throughout the lumbar  spine, but these 
are probably not responsible for Ms. Ralls aff’s current low back pain and lower 
extremity symptoms. These were also likel y aggravated by the forces produced in 
the MVC of 10-18-04.  
3. Cervical acceleration/deceleration (whipl ash) injury to the cervical spine 
secondary to MVC 10-18-04. A VF study confirms a significant motion in 
RALLSAFF, Susan 
Page 12 of 16 
  
translation at C2-3, but there is also a pre-existing de generative spondylolisthesis 
at C2 which might complicate that  picture (See DISCUSSION below). 
4. There are no clear cut radi culopathic signs in the upper extremities, but there are 
multi-level disc protrusions in this region which range from 2.2 to 3.2 mm. These were also likely aggravated by the fo rces produced in the MVC of 10-18-04. 
5. Chronic recurrent headaches secondary to #3. 
6. Mild congenital dysplasia of the cervical spine with degenerative 
spondylolisthesis of C2.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Ms. Rallsaff was injured in a rear impact ca r-to-car collision. A number of known risk 
factors are present in this case that explain a more difficult recovery and poor outcome in 
this relatively low velocity co llision. These include female sex (22, 23), being unaware of 
impending collision (24, 25), rear impact vect or (26), use of seat belts and shoulder 
harness (23), middle age (27), pr e-existing degenerative change s in the spine (28), initial 
back pain (29), loss of cerv ical lordosis (30), and immedi ate onset of symptoms (31). 
 
Following her injury, Ms. Rallsaff was seen first at the ER and then by her private 
physician. She later was seen by a chiropracto r, Kelly Gibson, who treated her from 
November of 2004 through March of 2005 and Ms. Rallsaff made good progress during that treatment. However, sh e later began to develop a pr ogressively worsening condition 
with regard to the low back.  This is probably the result of an initial injury to the lumbar 
and cervical discs and they have gradually broken down over the ensuing two years (32, 33). She also has up to 5 mm of longitudi nal spinal translation at C2-3, but the 
preexisting degenerative spondylolisthesis probably contributes to this motion.  
 
The cervical spine radiographic study revealed an  isolated scoliosis in the cervical spine. 
This is a very unusual finding. There was also a degenerative spondylolisthesis at C2 which is also a rare condition. These two observations would be consistent with 
congenital dysplasia of the cervical spine, which, upon closer inspection, is in fact 
present. Subsequent degenerative changes, which are concentrated at lower cervical 
levels, are the downstream result of this c ondition. These conditions, by themselves, are 
often not symptomatic and are often discovered—as in this case—in the investigation of 
a new trauma. This condition, however, would have  increased both he risk of acute injury 
and the risk for long-term sy mptoms following the kind of trauma she experienced in the 
subject MVC. 
 
The more immediate problem today is the ve ry severe low back pain and radicular 
symptoms in the lower extremities.  
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
RALLSAFF, Susan 
Page 13 of 16 
  
1. Surgical evaluation for lumbar di sc herniation as described above. 
2. Weight loss program to decrease  the stress on the lower back. 
3. Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation (2000 mg/day) for inflammation control. 
4. Graded exercise directed at reducing the lumbar lordosis. I would recommend 
initially strengthening the ha mstrings and gluteus groups, as well as the rectus 
abdominis muscles. Ms. Rallsaff should also be encouraged to stretch her 
hamstrings and gradually increase her general activity through walking, cycling, 
swimming, or other activity she can tolerate. 
5. When the back pain is severe, she should try sleeping in the supine position with 
her hips and knees flexed. This can be  done by placing couch cushions under the 
legs. 
6. Home cervical traction, twice daily. 
 
PROGNOSIS AND FUTU RE MEDICAL NEEDS 
 
Ms. Rallsaff may benefit from a trial epidural  steroid injections in the lumbar spine. 
Failing that, she may also be a candidate for lu mbar spinal surgery and should be seen for 
surgical consultation. Needle electromyographic and nerve conduction studies of the paraspinal and lower extremity muscles should also be undertaken at this point in time. 
 
ADDENDUM AND FINAL DISPOSIT ION FOR DEPARTMENT OF 
SOCIAL SERVICES (1-2-06) 
 
Ms. Rallsaff has undergone further medical treatment without much in the way of resolution. She has a very significant lumbar disc herniation which is producing disabling low back and leg pain and which will limit here from heavy lifting, repetitive bending 
and stooping, working in a standing position for more than 20-30 minutes, working in a seated position for more than an hour, work ing on uneven surfaces or repetitive overhead 
lifting or repetitive use of her arms at or  above shoulder level. She would also be 
precluded from walking for more than 20 minut es at a time. Her mental faculties are not 
affected by her impairment, which should be considered permanent. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
 
The independent medical examination process was explained to the examinee and she understands that no physician- patient relationship was es tablished. She was advised 
that the information he provided will not be treated as confidential and a report will be sent to the requesting attorney. Informed consent was obtained with the examinee agreeing to proceed with the examination. The examinee also granted permission to 
obtain digital photographs or other records as needed.

RE:  SOUTH , Michael A.   
 DOI: 9-10-2002  
 DOE: 7-17-2006 
 
Dear Mr. Monro: 
 
On July 17, 2006 I had the opportunity to inte rview and examine Mr. Michael A. South 
in regard to injuries he claimed to have  suffered in a motor vehicle collision (MVC) 
which occurred on September 10, 2002. This is a report of my findings and conclusions 
in this case, including my opinions concerni ng Mr. South’s current a nd future condition; 
it is based on that interview and examination, as well as a review of records provided to 
me by your office (see REVIEW OF RECORDS). 
 
 
SOCIAL HISTORY 
 
Mr. South is currently living in  Santa Barbara. He is engaged to be married. He is a non-
smoker and uses alcohol only rarely. At the time of his MVC he was employed in real 
estate sales, and he conti nues to pursue this occupation. 
 
 
MEDICAL HISTORY 
 
Mr. South injured his neck in the mid-1980s while bodysurfing. The mechanism of injury 
was vertical loading as his head struck the sa nd and he believes that some type of fracture 
may have resulted from the incident. However,  he was not treated with a Halo fixation. 
He was treated by a chiropractor and an acupuncturist and has had some problems with his neck ever since. He had also been a chir opractic patient prior to this incident for 
maintenance care. Mr. South related that he wa s able to ride a motorcycle, ski, and play 
tennis and golf and that his mostly minimal (and sometimes minimal-to-slight) neck pain 
occurred typically 1-2 times per week befo re his most recent MVC and did not prohibit 
these activities. He has had chiropractic treatment 12-15 times per year since the mid-1980s. Mr. South also suffered a fracture of  the left wrist in about 1988 due to a 
motorcycle crash (MCC). It was treated with  cast immobilization but later necessitated 
surgery to the hand. He has some minor ongoi ng soreness from this. He had a hiatal

hernia in the 1980s also. He denies any seri ous illnesses or other significant spinal 
injuries or brain injuries. 
Mr. South was injured when his car was struck from the rear by another vehicle on 8-30-01. He was subsequently treated by Barry Nelson,  D.C. and he was also seen during that 
time frame by an orthopaedist named Davi d S. Wilgarde, M.D. (see REVIEW OF 
RECORDS). Mr. South related to me that after this injury his neck pain was exacerbated 
and it became slight or slight-to-moderate in severity for some time. He was also treated 
during this time frame with acupuncture. By the time of his MVC of 2002, his neck 
discomfort  had returned to its baseline level of severity and frequency.  
 
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS 
 
Mr. South takes Vicoprofen; as needed for pa in when playing golf or doing yard work). 
He also takes Soma occasionally as a muscle  relaxant and Lorazepam for sleep. In the 
recent past he has been prescribed test osterone cream, DHEA supplements, and gets 
HCG injections from a Dr. Mathis. 
  
 
HISTORY OF INJURY 
 
Mr. South related to me that he was drivi ng his vehicle through an  intersection and was 
struck from the right side by another vehicle which apparently  failed to yield the right of 
way and passed through a red light. This collisio n is described in more detail below (see 
REVIEW OF RECORDS). Mr. South does not  recall the immediat e events of the 
collision but believes he struck his head on part  of the car’s interior  and may have briefly 
lost consciousness. He does recall a transi ent out-of-body experience in which he had an 
image of looking down on his vehicle from above. He was wearing his seat belt and 
shoulder harness at the time. The police were called and both vehicles were eventually 
towed from the scene. After crash he di d not want to go with EMS. A friend who 
happened to be nearby took him to his doctor’s ER service. He felt like he was in shock 
and apparently had to wait 48 hou rs to get pain medications due  to concerns that he had a 
concussion. 
 
 
ORIGINAL CHIEF COMPLAINTS  
 
1. Neck pain which continued to escalate in severity over the first 48-72 hours, was 
exacerbated by any movement of the n eck and ultimately relieved only by 
epidural steroid injections. It radiated to  the left arm and elbow and into the left 
shoulder blade and was described as modera te to moderate-to-severe in severity 
initially, and it was constant. 
SOUTH, Michael A. 
Page 3 of 18 
  
2. Pain behind left eye which lasted about 6-8 weeks; headaches which lasted for 
about three months; some blurred vision. This constellation of symptoms began 
immediately after MVC. Provo cative factors are unclear, but the symptoms were, 
relieved somewhat by medications for pa in. lying down, and by closing his eyes. 
The pain in the eye was focused behind the left eye. The headaches were frontal and temporal, mostly over left ear. Both  were described as slight-to-moderate 
becoming moderate in severity and constant. 
3. Low back pain which began 48-72 hour s after the injury and which was 
exacerbated by most activity and relieved by medications and recumbency. It was  described as dull and aching; becoming more sharp a year or so later, and deteriorating (i.e., worsening beyond that point over years and up to the present 
time). It does not radiate and was described as slight-to-moderate initially, becoming eventually moderate or modera te-to-sever in recent years. It was 
initially constant. 
4. Had a number of bruises on ankles and knee and from contact with the car’s 
interior, the seat belt, and the shoulder harness. 
5. It took about a year to no tice cognitive problems. This coincided with some 
diminishing of his pain in genera l a decreased use of medications.  
 
 
CURRENT CHIEF COMPLAINTS 
 
1. Midline low back pain from about the L4 to the S1 level. It is exacerbated by 
certain activities, such as long walks. Mr. South can’t play tennis or body surf. He 
is now able to play golf, which is his passion. He is now considering surgery for 
this pain. The pain is relieved some what by lying flat, avoidance of many 
activities, and medications. The pain in  described as burning and sharp, “like 
nerve in my back.” It varies in severi ty from minimal-to-slight to moderate-to-
severe. It is constant. 
2. Neck pain which continues to be left sided over the entire length of the neck. It is 
exacerbated by sitting, being on his feet long periods, or driving long times. He takes medication as needed for pain c ontrol now. He also continued to have 
chiropractic therapy and he gets regular massages. The pain is described as an 
ache or “hurt” and it ranges in severity from minimal to slight-to-moderate. There 
is always some baseline discomfort. 
3. He complains of various cognitive difficulties such as forgetfulness, lost ability to 
remember numbers, and difficulty concentrating.  
 
As of the day of the examination, Mr. South indicated that his headaches have mostly 
resolved. His left eye symptoms have mostly abated, although he still feels irritation to 
left eye when he is fatigued. He denies any blurred vision now. His neck pain has 
improved 50-70% since his surger y. His low back, however, is worse that it has been in 
the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
 
General 
 
Mr. South presented as a healthy appearin g 63-year-old man who appeared somewhat 
younger than his stated age. He is 5 ft 11 in in height and we ighed 185 lb. He is right hand 
dominant. Pulse was 8 bpm and bl ood pressure was 118/85 mmHg. 
 
Head 
 
Ophthalmoscopic and otoscopic examination was unremarkable. Mr. South wears corrective lenses.  
 
Cervical Spine 
 
Ranges of motion in the cerv ical spine were recorded using the JTech TrackerTM  (JTech 
Medical, Salt Lake City, UT ), a digital co mputer interface utili zing wireless dual 
inclinometry. Figure 1 is a ba r chart of the age- and gender-normalized expected vs. actual 
ROMs in the 6 standard degr ees of freedom based on regre ssion equations developed by 
Youdas et al. from a large ag e-stratified study of asymptoma tic and atraumatic male and 
female subjects (1). The white bars repres ent the statical probabl e mean range of the 
respective motions for a 63-year-old uninjured normal male. The gray bars represent the 
statistical mean of the actual measured ranges I re corded during my examination of Mr. 
South, and the dark gray bars  indicate percentage of devia tion (in this case loss) of ROM 
from the expected. This method  of assessing patient veracity  has been shown to be more 
sensitive than the AMA Guidelines  methodology (2). Cervical ex tension, left rotation, right 
lateral flexion, and left lateral flex ion were significantly diminished.

Extremities 
 
Range of motion in the major jo ints of the upper an d lower extremities wa s full and painless. 
Grip strength was measured using the JTech TrackerTM (JTech Medical, Salt Lake City, UT) 
dynamometer set at the second station. Rapid ex change grip strength, in which the subject 
rapidly squeezes the dy namometer and then sw itches hands and squ eezes with the other 
hand, was rapidly repeated  for 10 repetitions. This is a validity test of effort and revealed an 
average grip strength of 49.9 lb on the left and 81.3  lb on the right. The test was deemed 
statistically valid, with a coefficient of variat ion of 15% or less.  
 
Digital algometry was measur ed using the JTech TrackerTM pressure transducer (JTech 
Medical, Salt Lake City, UT).  The average pressure tolerance over the pectoralis major 
muscle was 28 N which is below the suggested cut-off point of 32 N (normal is 50 N) (4). 
 
Circumferential measurem ents of the extremities  were as follows:

Muscle strength, as eval uated by manual muscle testing, was felt to be 5/5 in all groups of 
both upper and lower extremitie s with the exception of the left biceps which was 4+/5. 
Ranges of motion in the major joints of both uppe r and lower extrem ities were full and 
painless. There were no deformitie s. A scar was presen t over the distal as pect of the left 
wrist. 
 
Neurological Examination 
 
Deep tendon reflexes we re 2+ and equal bilate rally in both upper and lower extremities.  
Cranial nerves III through XII were intact and there was no evidence of pathological reflex 
or clonus. The peripheral vision in the left lateral field appeared to be grossly reduced. 
Sensitivity to pinprick was slig htly diminished in the left la teral forearm and thumb. Tinel’s 
sign was positive on the right. Romberg’s test was positive with  a consistent tendency to 
drift rearward. Mr. was alert, oriented in pe rson, place, and time, an d has a normal fund of 
knowledge. No pathological refl exes were noted. Coordination, toe walking, heel walking, 
and squat were performed norm ally. Crude tests of cognitive ability, however, suggested an 
ongoing problem with postconcussion syndro me. Mr. South was not able to accurately 
count by sevens backwards fro m 100, nor could he spell the word WORLD backwards, and 
he did not recall any of th e five random words he wa s tasked to remember.  
 
sEMG Examination 
 
Dynamic surface electromyography (sEMG) was performed on th e day of the examination. 
After the skin surface was prep ped, electrodes were placed over the sternocleidomastoideus 
muscles and paraspinal muscles, with partic ular attention paid to precise symmetrical 
placement, and Mr. South was ta ken through a standard kinema tic montage which consisted 
of repeat flexion-neutral-flexion,  left and right lateral flexion, and cervical rota tion to the left 
and right. After sufficient warm-up, recording were made  in all ranges. Significant 
disharmony in agonist and an tagonist rhythm in both th e sternocleidomastoideus and 
paraspinal musculature occurred during lateral flexion of the cerv ical spine, Fi gure 3.  The 
findings are consistent with chronic neck pain with asymmetrical motor control.

Whiplash Disability Questionnaire (WDQ) 
 
This questionnaire is a 14- question assessment, sensitive to symptoms common to 
persons with musculoskeletal and mild traumatic  brain injuries, arranged in a Likert 0-10 
format, with 0 being the optimal, non-symptoma tic response. This instrument has been 
clinically validated (5, 6). Mr. South’s mean score was 6.5, indicating a very significant 
degree of impairment. 
 
CAD Symptoms Questionnaire 
 
The CAD Symptoms Questionnaire is one that I use to assess the credibility of the 
patient’s claims. Mr. South completed this questionnaire on the date of the examination 
and his responses well within normal boundaries of expectations. indicating that he was 
not symptom magnifying. 
 
Neck Disability Index (NDI) a nd Oswestry Disability Index 
 
SOUTH, Michael A. 
Page 9 of 18 
  
The NDI score was 44%, indicating as ma rked degree of ongoing disability. This 
instrument has been clinically validated and is currently the instru ment of choice in 
research (7-9). This instrument was pattern ed after the Oswestry Disability Index, which 
is widely used for low back disorders. Mr. South’s Oswestry score was consistent at 42-
44%. 
 
LiSat-11 
 
The LiSat-11 Is a life satisfaction instrume nt for semi-quantitativ e assessment of life 
satisfaction and is an indicat or of the presence of depr ession. Mr. South expressed the 
highest scores of life satisfac tion in most categories, indica ting that depression is not a 
diagnostic concern. The only two midrange (lowe r) scores were for “my leisure situation” 
and “my physical health,” which are consiste nt with his desire to be more physically 
active in sports and his concern over his continuing neck and back pain. 
 
Problem Checklist 
 
The Problem Checklist is an instrument consis ting of 43 questions using a Likert scale (0-
7) which is used in assessment of common m ild traumatic brain injuries (MTBI) and their 
sequelae (10). A score of 0 is the expected normal, non-affected score. Mr. South’s mean 
score was 2.9, with many items in the 5 and 6 range endorsed, indicating a significant and 
intrusive ongoing postconcussion syndrome.  
 
Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire 
 
This questionnaire is used to  identify ongoing disability fr om MTBI and postconcussion 
syndromes which result from it (11). It comp rises 16 questions arranged in a Likert 
format (0-4).  Of these, four items were e ndorsed as level 4 and 7 as level 3, indicating a 
significant ongoing postc oncussion disability. 
 
The SCL-90R 
 
The System Checklist-90 Revised is a well established and validated instrument for 
assessing the psychological status of individuals. It has also been shown to be sensitive to 
the type of chronic pain found in persons with  whiplash injuries and to be capable of 
distinguishing between real pa tients and persons faking an injury (12-15). Mr. Souths 
score fell well within the normal range indica ting that he is not making any attempt at 
symptom magnification or exaggeration.

REVIEW OF RECORDS  
 
These are records from the office of Barry  Nelson, D.C., Rancho Mirage. This is 
describing a motor vehicle collision which occurred on 08-30-01 and is described as a 
situation in which Mr. South was at a comp lete stop and was struck from the rear by 
another vehicle. His diagnosis is Posttrauma tic Cervical and Thoracic Strain-Sprain and 
Cervicocranial Syndrome. The prognosis is stated as fair and that Mr. South has 
improved significantly, however, he  is likely to experience pe riodic flare-ups of neck 
pain due to the severity of his injuries and he may require 5-7 chiropractic treatments 
annually to alleviate any flare-ups. 
 
I reviewed notes from the office of David S.  Wilgarde, M.D., Desert Orthopaedic Center. 
Chief complaints were listed as neck pai n, headaches, left eye fluttering, and blurred 
vision. The indications are that he was the rest rained driver of a Jeep Cherokee that was 
rear ended while sitting at  a stop light. The vehicle su stained $1,000 of damage. His 
symptoms began 24 hours after the collision. He  has been getting chiropractic treatment 
and has 50% improvement in his pain. The eye symptoms are the reason for his coming 
in. There is also a history of “a bad neck” in  that he had an old surfing injury 25 years 
ago and sustained some injury to C4 and C5. He has some intermittent tingling in the left 
arm. There is a normal cervical lordosis with mild restricted cervical ROM in all planes. 
 
I reviewed a traffic collision report, State of California. Party #1 was listed as Norris 
White driving a 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis. The car was owned by Hertz rental car. 
The posted speed limit was 50 mph. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The indicated areas of damage are to the front bum per from about midpoint to the far right of 
the bumper and then backward to about the front  of the right wheel well, and again on the 
side of the vehicle from about the B pillar to the C pillar region. Th e vehicle driven by 
Michael South, was a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee. His speed limit was listed as 35 mph. Damage to his vehicle was considered mode rate whereas for the other vehicle it was 
major. Damage was to the right side of the front and back approxima tely to the front of 
the right wheel well. There is a diagram of the collision. According to the police report, Mr. White was westbound on I-111 approaching Deep Canyon at about 35-40 mph. Mr. South was northbound on Deep Canyon and had the green light when he entered the intersection. He was struck on right side of his vehicle.  
 
This is immediate discharge instructions and notes from Desert Medical Group, Inc., 
dated 9-10-02.  He is given the diagnosis of MVA with acute cervical strain, multiple contusions and head trauma. It is recomme nded he use an ice pack, follow-up with his 
primary care in physician in one to two days, and he is taking Naprosyn with meals. He 
was seen by M. Ray Windham, M.D.    
 
This is an examination by Patricia Eb augh, M.D. on the following day. (The notes 
indicate auto accident yesterday.) He is having severe pain in the chest and hips. Radiographs were taken. He was prescribed Vicoprofen and schedul ed to be seen the 
following day, He has multiple contusions to the neck and chest and hips. He is seen

again the next day, also by Dr. Eubaugh, and the notes reflect, “much improved, slept 
well last night. Looks better and obviously feels better. No need to return unless 
complications arise.” 
 
This was an open system imaging MRI of the cervical spine report dated 10-15-02. A correlative study was taken on 08-20-01. The im pression was that C3-4 showed mild 
foraminal narrowing bilaterally  secondary to uncinate hypertrophy-spondylosis. At C5-6 
there was advanced degenerative disc disease with end pl ate ridging encroaching on the 
distal epidural space. There was mild effaceme nt of the spinal cord with slight central 
canal stenosis. This was not as prominent as on the prior study of 08-20-01. There is mild 
foraminal narrowing on the left secondary to uncinate hypertrophy. The right neural foramen was patent. At C6-7 there was mini mal central canal stenosis secondary to 
circumferential disc bulging. There was mild foraminal narrowing bilaterally secondary to spondylosis. At the remaining levels ther e was no neural impingement or compromise. 
This report was signed by Stuart May, M.D. 
 
On 11-04-02 there is a follow-up from the mo tor vehicle crash by Dr. Civerna. He was 
apparently seen for the flu. There was a comm ent about the car crash. I can’t read all of 
the notes due to poor copy quality but there is a comment about still severe neck and 
upper trapezius pain. He’s still taking Vicopr ofen. There was fluttering in left eye and 
patient appeared depressed. He also had compla ints of low back pai n. There was a loss of 
balance and visual disturban ce. A suspicion of secondary cerebral contusion was noted 
and an MRI of the brain was suggested. 
 
There is a health scan imaging report fr om William, Kelley, M.D. dated 11-12-02. This 
was requested by Jitka Civerna, M.D. Mr. S outh was evaluated for headaches and left 
orbital pain and ataxia since his MCV in September 2002. This was a Gadolinium 
Contrast Study and did not demonstrate any focal or diffuse brain injury..  
 
There is an orthopaedic surgery initial inta ke, from Ronald Portnoff, M.D. The chief 
complaint was cervical, left shoulder,  low back and bilateral knee pain. 
 
I reviewed an Initial Pain Management Cons ultation, from Craig Rosenblum, M.D. dated 
12-17-02. He was seen at the request of Dr. Portnoff. Chief complaints were chronic 
headaches and neck pain. He was also compla ining of memory difficulties. There was a 
history of a cervical fracture  20 years ago surfing. Apparently the bones auto fused, it 
says. Also there was a comment about the 2001 rear end collision. He was not having any 
upper extremity symptoms. His im pression was: 1) left cervi cal radiculopathy (level not 
indicated); 2) cervical MRI evidence of multilevel central canal stenosis, spondylosis, 
and bilateral foraminal narrowing. He discussed epidural steroid injections for the neck. 
He was going to continue with Vicoprofen. He suggested additional ibuprofen. 
 
There is a lumbosacral MRI from Truly Open  MRI requested by Ronald Portnoff, M.D., 
and read by William Kelley, M.D. It is da ted 12-31-02. The impression was mild 2 to 2-
½ and 2-½ to 3 mm posterior disc bulging(s) are shown at L4-5 and L5-S1 with mild 
SOUTH, Michael A. 
Page 12 of 18 
  
osteophytic ridging at L5-S1. At each of these levels there is minimal bilateral stenosis of the lateral recesses of equivocal potentia l clinical significance. No associated 
neuroforaminal narrowing is present. No bony injury is shown and there is no evidence of 
significant discogenic change above the L4 leve l. Although this is described as a Marconi 
Medical Systems Proview Truly MRI Open Sy stem, there is no comment as to whether 
this is actually a weight bearing-standing study.    
 
Beginning on 2-20-03, Mr. South be gan a series of epidural st eroid injections from Dr. 
Rosenblum. In total, between this date and June  of that year, he had four epidural steroid 
injections in the cervical spine. The follo wing month he also had a lumbar epidural 
steroid injection by Dr. Roesnblum. 
 
On 10-29-03 handwritten notes of Ronald Po rtnoff, M.D. indicate that Mr. South was 
complaining of cervical spine pa in and had had five epidural steroid injections with Dr. 
Rosenblum. He also had stiffness in the nec k. He had had one epi dural for the lumbar 
spine and was getting chiropractic manipulati on by Dr. Dixon. He was also getting PT at 
Rancho PT and was taking Vicoprofen and Skelaxin.  
 
On 11-14-03 another cervical sp ine MRI was taken at  the behest of Ronald Portnoff, 
M.D. This was reported by Byron Sotomayor, M.D. 
 
On 1-12-04 there was a report from Alfred C. Shen, M.D., Desert Spine and Neurological 
Institute. This was a neurosurgical consultation. The referring physician was Dr. Dixon. His impressions were cervical strain-sprain, cervical spondylosis, with previous auto 
fusion at C5-6, and juxtapositional degeneration at C6-7 with bilateral foraminal stenosis, symptoms of left C6 vs. C7 radiculopathy, lumbar strain-sprain. and L5-S1 degenerative disc disease. He recommended home cervical traction, a trial of Bextra, a trial of Norco, 
discontinuing the Vicoprofen, and conservative  therapy with regard to the low back. He 
suggested cervical spine x-rays with flexio n-extension views and a follow-up in eight 
weeks. 
 
In January and February of 2004 Mr. South had another round of injections to his neck 
and low back from Dr. Rosenblum. 
 
On 5-4-04 Mr. South was seen by Michael Si ngelyn, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon. Dr. 
Singelyn reviewed the history of injury. He reported that Mr. South suffers bouts of depression. On examination, the neck showed  no spasm of muscle or tenderness to 
palpation. His motion was good, but not entirely normal for a 60-year-o ld individual. He 
brought his chin to within one fingerbreadth of his chest and had 20° extension, 50° right 
rotation, 40° left rotation, and 25° right and left tilt. Overall th is represents 10-20% 
reduction in ROM and he reported pain in all ranges. The lumbar spine was considered to 
be within normal limits. He reviewed a number of medical records. There is a comment regarding the package of records from Dr. Civerna and Ebaugh dated 09-25-03 in which he was treated with Zoloft for posttraumatic  stress disorder and that he appeared 
depressed. He also noted that Mr. South he did not like Zoloft and was seeing a 
SOUTH, Michael A. 
Page 13 of 18 
  
nutritionist. There was also a comment regard ing Alfred Shen, M.D. that his letterhead 
indicates he was a neurosurge on, but referencing the 2004 direct ory of all board certified 
physicians Dr. Shen was not list ed as being board certified in any specialty. There was a 
comment about an MRI of the left knee dated 12-31-02. I did not see this record but this 
shows a small tear of the posterior horn of  the medial meniscus and mild chondromalacia 
of the patella on the left. Apparently there wa s also a neck MRI that was done prior to the 
accident. Singelyn notes that “all of the various  MRIs basically show only various levels 
of degenerative disease, comparable with someone who was 60 years of age.” None of 
them show clear-cut nerve root compression or cord compression. Dr . Singelyn, referring 
to every stimulus, pain, ache, or emotiona l disturbance that has presented since the 
accident, noted that the bottom line was, mo st of these claims are unfounded. Then he 
discussed individual claims noting, “he did not injure either knee in the subject accident.” 
He noted the claimed injury to the skull making reference to left eye pain and stated that, 
“All I can say is that he did not hit his head on anything, or at least there is no evidence in 
the records around the time of the acci dent indicating he hit his head on 
anything…Actually I find that claim to be seriously in question (indicating loss of 
consciousness).” He also stated that in his experience as an orthopaedic surgeon and also 
someone who did ride-alongs with the Whittier Police Departme nt for 25 years, a history 
of loss of consciousness would have b een followed by an immediate paramedic 
transportation to the nearest hospital. He discounted the complaints of depression on the 
basis that there was some hist ory of depression in the medical  records. He also noted the 
sensation of being tired and fatigued was a cl assic sign of depression. He noted that “I do 
not see any evidence that he was emotionally any worse off now than he was prior to the 
accident.” As for the neck and back, he beli eves the collision did not create a “major 
lumbar injury, and certainly did not create any anatomical changes to  this man’s lumbar 
spine.” He again notes the lumbar spine was not mentioned in office visits on the day of 
the accident or the day after.  Also there was a record on 11-04-02 that does not make 
reference to the lumbar spine. It was his conclusion that Mr. Sout h did not injure his 
lumbar spine in the crash. He was critical of  Dr. Rosenblum’s mentioning of the low back 
as being a common sequel to th e neck problem. As far as the neck was concerned he says 
he did not rupture a cervical di sc. There have not been any radicular symptoms to permit 
the diagnosis of radiculopathy. He co uld not understand why Mr. South was so 
symptomatic with regard to his neck. He wrote, “It is true that cervical strains-sprains may be symptomatic for a few weeks.” This may be prolonged with pre-existing degenerative changes. And he comments on th e 09-12-02 visit with Dr. Ebaugh which he 
says, “Gives one serious food for thought as to why Mr. South should be still suffering 
the torches of the damned two years late r.” The indication was that he was much 
improved, slept well and feels better. He also  noted he has no e xperience with anyone 
receiving 8-10 epidural steroid injections over a cour se of 15 months. He thinks there was 
no physiologic basis for this. “The patient has an  arthritic neck. He sprained an arthritic 
neck. He did not rupture a disc. What in the world are these multiple steroid injections actually treating?” He also notes he sees no objective findings. He told Mr. South he felt 
that depression was probably the principle contributor and cause for his feelings of pain 
and fatigue. Since there is no objective muscul oskeletal basis for his complaints, we are 
left, he said, “with a di agnosis of depression.”  
SOUTH, Michael A.

On 10-13-04 there was a Patient Information Fo rm from the office of Craig Shugart, D.C. 
Major complaints included cervical and lumbar symptoms. This was secondary to motor vehicle crash on 09-11-02. Complaints checked on the form include neck pain, shoulder 
pain, and low back pain.     
 
There was a Neurosurgical Consultation by E.  Scott Conner, M.D. on 11-9-04. The main 
complaint was left neck and shoulder pain. He  has looked at x-rays  taken on the day of 
the crash as well as the MRI and his symptoms were consistent with stenosis on the left at 
C3-4 and he recommended a foraminal block. He also wanted to get a CT scan.   
 
A CT scan of the cervical spine taken at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital reported by Dr. 
Sanjiv Sheel on 11-15-04. There was a mild revers al of the lordotic curve centered at C5-
6. No evidence of significant compression de formity was noted. There was apparent 
posterior fusion extending from C4 through C6. At C3-4 there is a minimal anular disc 
bulge with left greater than right joint arth ropathy causing moderate left and mild right 
neuroforaminal narrowing. No central canal stenosis was seen. C4-5 had no significant 
findings. At C5-6 there was a small posterior osteophyte which was mildly effacing the anterior thecal sac. It did app ear to contact the cord with an  AP canal diameter of 8 mm at 
this level. At C6-7 there was a disc-o steophyte complex causing mild central canal 
stenosis with an AP diameter of 7.5 mm. Th ere was also mild hypertrophic facet joint 
change. This combination resulted in modera te bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing. There 
was left greater than right facet joint arthro pathy at C7-T1 but no significant narrowing or 
stenosis. There was a hemangioma of the T2 vertebral body. 
 
On 11-19-04 there was an operative report from R.  Michael Hullander, M.D. This is a left 
C4 selective nerve block and a C3-4 epidural steroid injection. They injected 4 mg of 
Celestone. 
 
This is a medical examination from Stev en Young, M.D. dated 1-1-05. The principle 
reason for this examination was to check the ch olesterol level, to ev aluate neck pain, and 
for “testicular failure” and checkup. A lis t of medications included Lorazepam, 
Pravachol, AndroGel, Viagra, and multiple supplements. There was also a comment 
about Ativan. Apparently he was using that  to help him sleep. There was no anxiety. 
There was a complaint of numbness and tingli ng in the left shoulder and arm. There was 
weakness of the left arm and he had nighttime muscle cramps in the left leg. He was 
cleared to proceed with neck surgery. 
 
I reviewed the Operative Report from Sant a Barbara Cottage Hospital dated 2-4-05. The 
physician is E. Scott Conner. Martin Bean, P.A. is the assistant. He gets a left posterior 
cervical foraminotomy at C3-4 and C6-7 with application of a cran ial tong. There is a 
comment that the stenosis at C3-4 was seve re and extended very far laterally so that 
essentially a nearly complete facetectomy had to be carried out to get complete decompression of the nerve. There was not as much stenosis as at C6-7. 
 
SOUTH, Michael A. 
Page 15 of 18 
  
There was an MRI of the lumbar spine from Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital dated 5-2-05 which was interpreted by Thomas Daughters, M.D. There was a comment that marrow signal was notable only for discogenic end pl ate changes around the severely degenerated 
disc at L5-S1. There are changes at L2-3 but  no canal or foraminal stenosis. L4-5 shows 
some degenerative loss of disc signal and mi nimal annular disc bulge that effaces the 
anterior thecal sac. The neural foramina are adequately patent. There was some mild facet 
hypertrophy. At L5-S1 there was degenerative disc disease with small broad-based 2-3 
mm posterior disc protrusion th at does contact the anterior thecal sac and budding as one 
nerve root. The neural foramina are mildly  narrowed bilaterally. There was no central 
canal stenosis and there was so me degenerative facet hypertrophy. 
 
 
OVERALL DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS 
 
1. Chronic minimal-to-slight to moderate-t o-severe low back pain secondary to 
MVC of 9-10-02. 
2. Chronic minimal to slight-to-moderate n eck pain and mild left-sided radicular 
component secondary to MVC 9-10-02 supe rimposed on mild chronic neck pain 
due to old surfing injury. Mr. South is now post surgical in the neck. 
3. Chronic postconcussion syndrome, secondary to MVC of 9-10-02. There is also a possible neuroendocri nological component. 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
From my interview and examination of Mr. South I am left with the impression that 
although he did suffer an injury to his neck  bodysurfing in the 1980s, it left him with only 
occasional symptoms which he managed with chiropractic maintenance treatment as is common. He was not precluded from playing te nnis, golf, or other sports. There was a 
rear impact MVC several months prior to the MVC of 9-10-02, but the indications are 
that this produced only a transient exacerbation of neck symptoms which were controlled by several months of chiropract ic treatment. It was the MVC of 9-10-02 which produced 
a substantial and permanent aggravation of n eck pain and low back pain, as well as a 
postconcussion syndrome. In my opinion, this  event ultimately n ecessitated his neck 
surgery and resulted in his current low back condition, which is now his primary complaint. 
 
The biomechanics of this type of collision is such that initiall y, Mr. South would have 
moved in the direction of th e striking vehicle. Immediat ely afterward, he would have 
been thrown back toward his driver’s side door. During this phase, c ontact with this side 
of the vehicle would be likely and could have produced some transient loss of 
consciousness. Records are clear that a conc ussion was present after the crash and the 
tests I administered all point to a postconc ussion syndrome as a reliable diagnosis and 
SOUTH, Michael A.

explanation for his various cogni tive problems. With or without head contact, neck injury 
is very likely in side impact collisions, as is low back injury. Concussion can also occur 
with or without head contact and wi th or without loss of consciousness. 
 
It is also evident from the records that the low back injury did originate with the MVC of 
9-10-02, but this condition had progressed over the ensuing years to the point where Mr. 
South is contemplating surgery. His lumb ar spine ROM is severely limited and 
dysfunctional. It is notewort hy that Dr. Singelyn reported a normal range here, but it is 
likely that he did not actually measure it si nce he did not report the ranges in degrees. 
 
Dr. Singelyn was highly critical of the epidural steroid inject ions. Mr. South informed me 
that he was the one requesting them because they provided him with at least temporary 
relief from neck pain. Dr. Singelyn found a comment about depression in a report and 
concluded that virtually all of Mr. South’s current conditi on was attributable to this 
diagnosis. However, these records to not pr ovide an actual diagnos is of depression in 
terms of the DSM-IV. Moreover, the questionn aires I administered indicate no signs of 
depression and Mr. South does not appear to be depressed to me. Dr. Singelyn placed 
great reliance upon a single document which seem to be far out of character compared to the rest of the records in this file. He commented concerning his experience as a police ride-along and the fact that reports of a lo ss of consciousness would prompt immediate 
transport to the hospital. I woul d beg to disagree. I worked as  a paramedic for four years, 
both on ambulances and in hospital ERs. I also  served with the Sheriff’s Office for 10 
years. A loss of consciousness, when brief, is often not apparent ev en to the victim. And 
many injured persons at the scene of a collis ion will refuse to be transported to the 
hospital for a number of reasons.  
 
We have suspected that MTBI can result in  neuroendocrinological disorders, such as 
hypothyroidism for some time (16). More re cently, disturbances in thyroid hormone, 
growth hormone, and gonadotropins have al so been reported among a population of 
persons suffering MTBI (17). Mr . South’s current medical trea tment could well be related 
to his MTBI. 
 
 
PROGNOSIS AND FUTURE MEDICAL 
 
Mr. South is currently stable in terms of his neck pain. The surgery was successful, but, 
as is often the case, some degree of ongoing pain continues. That will be permanent. He 
continues to have a mild sensory deficit and some weakness in his left upper extremity. His low back has become progressively mo re of an issue and is now a disabling 
condition. He has had the benefit of conservativ e therapy in the form of physical therapy, 
chiropractic treatment, and acupuncture withou t lasting benefit and would like to be out 
of pain and to be able to be more active.

RE: Claimants:  Marina Whitworth and Michael Whitworth 
 Insured:  Thomas R. Goldfinger, D.C. 
 NCMIC Claim No.: 11587 
 D/Loss:  10-30-95 
Your File No.:  4053 
 
Dear Mr. Waller: 
 
This report was prepared, following your request , in accordance with Alaska Civil Rule 
26(a)(2). I understand th at the issues of my fee schedul e and qualifications have been 
previously arranged and will not, therefore, be repeated here. 
 
Opinions 
 
1. Dr. Goldfinger’s care and treatment of Ms. Whitworth falls well within the 
standard of care of care in the chiropract ic profession and there is no evidence of 
negligence in his management of this case at any time. 
 
Reasons for Opinion 1: 
 
Having reviewed the records and documents mentioned below, it is clear that Dr. 
Goldfinger’s associate doctor (Holt) perfor med a complete physical examination of Ms. 
Whitworth on the date of her industrial in jury (10-30-95). In addition to obtaining a 
description of the injury, Dr . Holt asked Ms. Whitworth wa s whether she had any bowel 
or bladder problems and she denied these at the time. Her vital signs and other 
measurements were described. Spinal ra nge of motion measurements (along with 
notations about which of these were painful), grip strength measurements, spinal posture 
assessment, and a variety of chiropractic, orthopaedic, and neurol ogical tests were 
performed. The neurological component included deep tendon reflex measurement and a pinwheel examination. This examination was complete and, in fact, was more 
comprehensive that is typical of initial ch iropractic examinations based on the stated 
history of injury and initial comp laints. I find no significant omissions. 
 
On subsequent visits, Dr. Goldfinger provi ded Ms. Whitworth with suggestions for 
exercises and performed various types of spinal manipulation. His notes and clinic documents suggest Ms. Whitworth complain ed variously of low back, neck, and 
extremity discomfort, as well as occasiona l gait abnormalities and numbness. These gait 
abnormalities have subsequently been desc ribed by Dr. Goldfinger as being due to 
antalgic guarding due to back pain, as opposed to the type of gait a bnormalities resulting

from upper motor neuron disease (i.e., my elopathy). Notes from 1993 reflect that Ms. 
Whitworth had a history of neck pain and/or  stiffness with some degree of radiographic 
abnormality. She has also complained to Dr. Goldfinger and her other health care providers of numbness in various areas—bot h before the 1995 industrial injury and 
subsequent to it. For example, Dr. Krehlik’s records of 5-9-95 reflect that she complained 
that half of her body was numb on the right. Her numbness had, in fact, responded to chiropractic treatment in the past and this  would certainly have  provided reasonable 
clinical encouragement for Dr. Goldfinger to cont inue with this form of care, in addition 
to the fact that numbness is one of th e most common presenting complaints by 
chiropractic patients. Moreover,  it was known to Dr. Goldfinger that she had diabetes and 
that a diabetic type of neuropathy might  be responsible for this numbness. From 
statements made by Ms. Whitwor th (interview by the Expert Panel) she admitted that she 
generally got at least temporary relief from this type of ch iropractic care and never had 
any untoward reaction to it. 
 
Although the records clearly refl ect a disparity in the chr onology of the onset of key 
physical complaints, it is noteworthy that these complaints are not reflected in Dr. Goldfinger notes and that, with a few exceptio ns, his are the only contemporaneous notes 
during this critical time frame. Any chir opractor would easily recognize the significance 
of the range of complaints Ms. Whitworth cl aims to have had, including numbness from 
the nipple line down, sexual dysfunction, bowel, a nd bladder problems. It is clear that Dr. 
Goldfinger did because it was a question asked of  Ms Whitworth on his initial 
examination form. Moreover, I cannot concei ve of any logical reason why Dr. Goldfinger 
would have purposely ignored these developmen ts if they had been communicated to him 
directly by Ms. Whitworth. In his interrogati on by the Expert Panel, he denied ever 
hearing about this widespread numbness and st ated that the numbness he referred to in 
his daily progress notes was lower extrem ity numbness, not numbness from the nipple 
line down. 
 
2. It is argued by Dr. Haldeman that  Dr. Goldfinger failed to perform a 
neurological examination of Ms. Whitworth despite the knowledge of increasing neurological symptoms. As noted above , this statement requires that one 
disregard the only contemporaneous records of these events—records for which there was, at the time, virtually no reaso n for biased reporting. Simultaneously, 
one must subscribe to the potentially fal lible memory of a patient who is also a 
plaintiff now bringing a lawsuit. In fact , she has described events variably to 
different physicians subsequently.  
 
Reasons for Opinion 2: 
 
Presumably, Dr. Haldeman is making the assu mption that, when Ms. Whitworth returned 
to Dr. Goldfinger’s office on 2-2-95, she was complaining of numbness from the nipple 
line down, as she has subsequently reconstructe d the series of events culminating in her 
first surgery. I would agree with him that were such complaints provided to Dr. 
Goldfinger at the time, it would have wa rranted a more thorough neurological 
examination and perhaps a referral to a neurologist. However, the Industrial Workers’ 
Whitworth, M.  v. Goldfinger T.R. 
Page 3 of 12 
 
Compensation form filled out by Dr. Gold finger on 2-2-96 reflects only that “This 
appears to be a sequelae 10-30-95 injury. Pa tient had a return of symptoms while 
working.” No new injury or striking change in  symptomatology is suggested in either this 
report or his fees slip of the same date , which has only the mid-back and low back 
complaints circled. The neck region is not noted  and no increase or decrease in circled, 
although these are offered on the form. Nor is  there any note about nipple-line down 
numbness. And it is my understanding that it is the patient’s responsibil ity to fill out this 
form on each visit. 
 
On 2-14-96, Dr. Goldfinger has noted that the patient has had an aggravation due to a particularly long and vigorous  day. Aggravation, in the medical vernacular, generally 
refers to a permanent worsening of a conditi on. However, there still is no mention of 
nipple line numbness or any other complain t suggesting a developing myelopathy in 
contemporaneous notes. Moreover, on subsequent  visits, Ms. Whitworth  is said to have 
improved, not worsened. On 2-23-96 gradual im provement is noted with improvement in 
gait and posture. In fact, this gradual improvement is  noted again on 3-15-96 when, 
again, there is no mention of global numbness,  bowel, bladder, or sexual dysfunction in 
the records. Moreover, it is obvious form the medical record that she never complained of 
severe pain and never misse d any time from work.  
 
To a well trained and experienced chiroprac tic physician, such a clinical progression 
prompts neither a more comprehensive neurolog ical evaluation nor neurological referral. 
To the contrary, it is seen as encouraging a continuation of the treatment plan. On the 
next and final visit (3-28-96) the notes of Dr. Goldfinger reflect that Ms. Whitworth is 
experiencing more numbness again, and he recommends a neurologi cal consultation and 
MRI. It is noteworthy that this is refl ected on the Industrial Workers’ Compensation 
report made by Dr. Goldfinger which bears the received stamp date of 4-11-96—four days prior to the date Ms . Whitworth was seen at the Bartlett Memorial Hospital 
emergency room. This is the first documen t describing widespread numbness, sexual 
difficulties, and bladde r and bowel dysfunction. 
 
3. I believe the records indicate that Ms. Wh itworth had a history of cervical spine 
disc disease dating back at  least as far as 1993. The industrial injury of 10-30-95 
no doubt aggravated this condition and probably acted as a catalyst in the accelerated breakdown of her cervical  discs over the subsequent months. 
Nevertheless, cervical disc disease is a co ndition which is frequently amenable to 
chiropractic treatment and is well within the standard of care. Spinal manipulation is not a contraindication. Moreover, it is clear that in Ms. Whitworth’s case, this form of treatment had been effective in the past and, even subsequent to the industrial injury of 10-30-95, by her own words, continued to 
be effective, albeit to a lesser degree. 
 
It is further my opinion that the chief fr agmentation of the C6-7 disc took place 
some time between 3-15-96 and 3-28-96 a nd that Dr. Goldfinger’s treatment did 
not precipitate, aggravate, or accelerate that inevitable even t. More likely, in 
fact, it is likely that his treatment merely forestalled th e inevitable. It is also my 
Whitworth, M.  v. Goldfinger T.R. 
Page 4 of 12 
 
opinion that this fragmentation signific antly continued after 3-28-96, becoming 
so severe eventually that she presented to the emergency room with a clear myelopathic presentation on 4-15-96—a p resentation that Dr. Goldfinger never 
saw. 
 
Reasons for Opinion 3: 
 
As noted earlier, there is no evidence of  a myelopathic presentation during Dr. 
Goldfinger’s treatment of Ms. Whitworth. Th e “gait” problems he noted were later 
described by him as relating to pain—not neurological disease. The numbness he noted 
was later qualified as lower extremity “num bness” which the medical record shows she 
has complained of intermittently since at least 1993. 
 
Subsequent to her 1996 surgical fusion for th e C6-7 disc herniation, Ms. Whitworth has 
been to surgery once again—this time for a hern iation of the C5-6 disc. The MRI study of 
4-16-96, however, disclosed a non-herniated C5-6 disc. No chiropractic treatment occurred after 3-28-96. Neither were any new in juries are reported to have occurred after 
that time. Yet the disc herniated spontane ously within two year s, requiring another 
surgical discectomy and fusion on 7-16-98. The operative report once again refers to the 
removal of “several free fragment s.” This is quite consistent w ith the natural history of an 
advanced degenerative disc di sease and, in fact, mirrors th e degenerative process of the 
C5-6 disc two years earlier, strongly pointing to two axioms of degenerative disc disease: 
1) once the degenerative proce ss has been initiated, the disc s break down inevitably and 
spontaneously, and 2), this breakdown is fairly rapid and often independent of 
conservative management strategies. 
 
4. Dr. Haldeman opined that a more thorough neurological investigation by Dr. Goldfinger (presumably he is referring to the months of February and March) 
would have resulted in an earlier discov ery of the C6-7 disc herniation and 
would have allowed earlier surgical rem edy. As a consequence of this earlier 
intervention, Ms. Whitworth would now suffer fewer ongoing symptoms, 
according to Dr. Haldeman. However, based on my review of the records, it is my opinion that Ms. Whitworth presente d with essentially the same type of 
complaints she’d had when last seen  by Dr. Goldfinger in November of 1995, 
and this is reflected in his notes an d his physician’s report to the workers’ 
compensation carrier. This history did not specifically warrant a comprehensive 
neurological or a comprehensive re-examin ation. Some practitioners might have 
done so, but, based on the contemporaneous records we have, this is would come down to a purely clinical decision. Th ere is no specific guideline or rule 
governing this practice and I would esti mate that such a re-examination would 
have occurred only about half the time.  
 
Moreover, it is also my opinion th at a more comprehensive neurological 
examination in February or March woul d not likely have yielded any findings 
that would prompt a referral to a neur ologist. Further, I would respectfully 
Whitworth, M.  v. Goldfinger T.R. 
Page 5 of 12 
 
disagree with Dr. Haldeman concerning his opinion that earlier surgical intervention would have left Ms. Wh itworth with fewer residual problems. 
 
Reasons for Opinion 4:  
 
Ms. Whitworth had a long history of ne urological symptoms (e.g., numbness), a 
favorable response to chiropractic care in  the past (which included a reduction of 
numbness) and a diabetic condition, which is well known to be associated with 
neuropathies. Based on these tempering influenc es, in combination with the fact that she 
never missed any work and that Dr. Goldfinger was viewing this as a mere continuation of the 10-30-95 injury, the decision to continue his treatment regime without an extensive re-examination or comprehensive neurological examination (such as deep tendon reflexes, pinwheel testing, muscle testing, etc.) when he saw Ms. Whitworth again in 
February of 1996 was justified and well within  the standard of care in the community. 
 
It is noteworthy that, even when Ms. Whitworth  was at the peak of her discomfort in mid 
April of 1996, displaying clear myelopathic sy mptoms, her neurological examination was 
not extraordinary, nor was it stable or c onsistent. I note that Dr. Liberatore found 
symmetrical 3+ deep tendon reflexes. Earl ier Dr. Holt (Dr. Goldfinger’s office) found 
them to be 2+. Both of these numbers are cons idered to be within normal limits, with the 
most important distinction being symmetry, wh ich apparently was never lost in either 
case. Indeed, the rating of these reflexes is purely subjective and it is  quite possible that 
one physician might rate a reflex as 2+ while another would rate it as 3+. Dr. Liberatore 
found a number of sensory abnormalities which might have been consistent with this 
condition, but it is noteworthy that just prio r to surgery, Dr. Smythies found her sensory 
apparatus “grossly intact,” a nd her motor strength 5/5 (i.e ., perfectly normal). See the 
table below. 
 
 
Variations in Neurological Presentation 
 ER 4-15-96 Smythies 4-19-96 
DTR 3+ and symmetrical Increased* 
Motor strength Normal Normal 
Babinski reflex (toes) Not mentioned Abnormal* 
Other pathological reflexes Not mentioned ?? 
Sensation (pinprick, etc.) Abnormal Grossly intact 
Two point discrimination Abnormal ??

Only those findings marked with an asteri sk in the above table would be clearly 
indicative of a myelopathic disorder. Numbne ss, a decrease in two-point discrimination, 
and paresthesias might also be a sign of th is condition, but these symptoms can also be 
seen in diabetic neuropathies and peripheral neuropathies of other e tiologies, and are not

Page 6 of 12 
 
exclusive to myelopathy. Therefore, it is not eworthy that, even when her condition was at 
its worst, her presentation was not definitively myelopathic until the day she was seen by Dr. Smythies.  
 
Her condition deteriorated mo st notably around late March and early April (note that Dr. 
Smythies report reads, “She developed sexual dysfunction and has been unable to control 
her bladder function for the last two weeks.”)  It is not clear when the bladder function 
trouble began, but it is clear that  it has become intolerable only since early April. It seems 
reasonable to assume, particularly in view of  the large variability of findings between 4-
15-96 and 4-19-96,  that a more thorough neur ological examination in February—and 
probably through the end of March—would not have revealed a substantial abnormality. 
At most, the findings woul d have been equivocal. 
 
It is well known that a larg e proportion of patients who undergo surgical decompression 
for disc herniations, in which neurological symptoms of numbness and paresthesias are a 
prominent part of the picture, never fully r ecover all of their sensory faculties. Many are 
left with ongoing paresthesiae, numbness, and neuropathic pain, such as hyperesthesia. Many also continue to have musculoskeletal pain. This is true even for patients who 
undergo surgery within days of a compressive  lesion. Therefore, there is virtually no 
scientific basis upon which to make a predicti on, such as Dr. Haldeman’s, that the delay 
(accepting for the moment Dr. Haldeman’s argument that there was a delay in making a 
referral) reduced the patient’s ch ances for full recovery. All one can really say is that it is 
a possibility. In my opinion, there was no dela y: the disc herniation and fragmentation 
occurred chiefly in later part of March a nd continued through mid April. By then, the 
referral had already been made. 
 
5. In my opinion, there were no classic sign s of myelopathy until the 3-28-96 office 
visit which would have alerted Dr. Gold finger to order more diagnostic tests of 
refer Ms. Whitworth out for neurological consultation. 
 
Reasons for Opinion 5: 
 
In reviewing the records availabl e to me, it is clear that Ms. Whitworth has set the date of 
nipple-line-and-below numbness to some time in  late December (ER records dated 4-15-
96). Other records record this as occurring in January. However, in view of the fact that 
no such distribution of true sensory abnormality was ever confirmed by any provider, even up to the time of her first surgery, it mu st be discounted as an important signal of 
developing myelopathy, particularly in view of her long history of intermittent numbness (including the type involving an  entire half of the body). It is also noteworthy that the 
Expert Panel, in about late  April of 1998, asked her about  her discussions of this 
numbness with Dr. Goldfinger. Her response was, “And yes I believe that I was very 
specific as to Dr. Tom, I am nu mb.” This was, in fact, not ve ry specific at all in view of 
her relatively long history of intermittent numbness. She was also asked why she wasn’t more specific about the numbness on the fee slips she was given to fill out on each visit, where she had the opportunity to indicate the ty pe of complaints she had, any changes in 
her condition, etc. Why didn’t she menti on numbness from the nipples down, truck 
Whitworth, M.  v. Goldfinger T.R. 
Page 7 of 12 
 
numbness etc., they asked? She responded, “Well neck, mid-back, and low back means 
this. And then my arms and legs were num b and my - - leg wasn’t working right. You 
know, I’m just doing the whole trunk. I’m not differentiating between the front and the 
back.” I suspect there was no such  diffuse numbness at that time. 
 
Another important sign of myelopathy is spas tic gait. This was noted at the time of 
surgery, but not by Dr. Goldfinger and not even  by Dr. Liberatore as late as 4-15-96. I 
note that there is a letter from Dr. Hunter-J oerns to Dr. Krehlik describing ataxia and 
spastic gait on the date of the MRI examin ation (4-17-96), but I have not seen any 
contemporaneous medical records of hers reflecting this observation. However, assuming it is accurate, one would reasonably conclude that this is consistent with a rapidly 
deteriorating condition, such that the ga it was not remarkable on 4-15-96, but became 
obviously spastic only two days later. Ce rtainly any ER physician appreciates the 
significance of spastic paralysi s and it would be extremely unusual for them to miss it in 
their examination or to omit the observation, once made, from their records. 
 
Another important sign of disc herniation and myelopathy is pain. In most cases, 
particularly when nerve roots are compressed or the spinal cord is compressed, patients 
experience rather marked discomfort which is  often quite severe. In the records I have 
reviewed, there is not any evidence that she experienced more than slight or perhaps 
moderate amounts of pain during her treatment with Dr. Goldfinger. Moreover, Ms. Whitworth admitted to feeling some degree of relief following his treatments. In her testimony to the Expert Panel, she stated th at, even as late as 2-14-96, she felt “pretty 
good” in the morning. She worked some 16 hours that day as well, although that appears 
to have aggravated her condition. This is clearly not a description of a patient with a severely ruptured disc, cord compression, nerve root compression, numbness from the 
nipple line down, severe constipation, ur inary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. 
 
The sexual dysfunction has been variously dated to around the end of January or mid February by Drs. Smythies and Bursell. This  is approximately the same time frame as 
that of the bowel dysfunction onset. However,  it is notable that while bowel dysfunction 
is a well known sign of myelopathy, Ms.  Whitworth’s conditi on was not a classic 
dysfunction. She never lost control of her bowels, but reported only constipation, which 
is a common problem and not, in and of its elf, a hallmark of neurological disease. 
Moreover, Dr. Goldfinger contends that she ne ver informed him of these problems. It is 
noteworthy that Ms. Whitworth mentioned to the Expert Panel that she may not have 
informed Dr. Goldfinger of her sexual dysfuncti on, but feels sure she informed him of her 
bowel and bladder problems. However, this is neither reflected in the documents that she 
filled out when she came to see him for treatment, nor in his contemporaneous notes. Most importantly, Dr. Hunter-Joerns’ letter to  Dr. Krehlik (5-17-96) seems likely to be 
the most reliable indicator of the onset of  bladder dysfunction, since the chronology is 
described in good detail, and based on a recent interview of the patient. Other reports are 
less clear, such as those of the ER (which included nurse ’s and physician’s notes), and 
those of Dr. Smythies, in which the dates of  onset were not stated precisely. The ER 
record has the bladder incontinence beginning on about 3-15-96. This would have been 
after the second to last treatment with Dr. Goldfinger on 3-13-96. Dr. Hunter-Joerns 
Whitworth, M.  v. Goldfinger T.R. 
Page 8 of 12 
 
named 3-28-96, specifically, as the first time Ms. Whitworth lost control of her bladder. This was the day she was referred by Dr . Goldfinger for MRI and neurological 
examination. It is noteworthy that, in the same record, Dr. Hunter-Joerns seems to partially contradict herself by stating that Ms. Whitworth  had urinary incontinence 
approximately two weeks before she saw he r. That would put the onset of bladder 
incontinence at about 4-3-96. We can only conclude from this that the bladder 
incontinence occurred first either on the day of referral by Dr. Goldfinger or perhaps even 
later. More revealing is Dr. Hunter-Joerns’ st atement in this same letter that the sexual 
problems and bowel problems started one m onth prior to the bladder dysfunction. This 
would put the onset of these symptoms at a bout 3-3-96. Dr. Goldfinger’s treatment record 
and fees slip which is filled out by the patien t do not, in any way, refl ect problems of this 
kind. It seems to me extremely improbable th at anyone would fail to mention a recent 
onset of incontinence (especially  in light of the other complaints she claims to have had) 
to their treating physician or that the physicia n would ignore it if she did inform him. 
 
Thus, since Dr. Goldfinger was probably not  informed by Ms. Whitworth of her sexual 
dysfunction, by her own admission, at best, he had only a complaint of  constipation to act 
on as of the 3-4-96 office visit. On the next visit, in which he noted gradual improvement in her condition, he would also apparently only have had the constipation complaint to 
alert him to underlying myelopathy. Only on the last visit of 3-28-96 is it possible (based 
on Dr. Hunter-Joerns’ one statement) that the bladder dysfunction was taking place. [I 
note that there are two fee slips that are not  dated. The only treatment dates which do not 
have dated fee slips are 2-23-96 and 3-28-96. Th us, it would seem logical to surmise that 
one of these undated fee slips is  that of the 3-28-96 visit. On neither of these forms filled 
out by Ms. Whitworth is there any mention of bladder problems.]  
 
Thus one is hard pressed to argue that Dr. Goldfinger failed to refer Ms. Whitworth in a 
timely manner. He could not have had a ny significant indicati on of myelopathy until 
(possibly) the last treatment session. And, the record strongly  indicates that, in fact, Ms. 
Whitworth’s condition dec lined most significantly after  only this date. 
 
6. Many of the complaints Ms. Whitworth had after the first surgery and prior to the second surgery might be attributable to peripheral neuropathies and not the 
effects of the first di sc herniation of 1996. 
 
Reasons for Opinion 6: 
 
Diabetic neuropathies are fairly common and the records indicate that Ms. Whitworth’s 
blood sugar was not well controlled and that she had a history of hypertriglyceridemia. 
These conditions are both known risk fact ors for neuropathy in diabetics.  
 
There is a nerve conduction velo city (NCV) report from Dr. Hunter-Joerns dated 7-18-96 
in which the diagnosis of “mild right car pal tunnel syndrome” is tendered. This, she 
noted, might be the result of either con tinued residual symptoms, post-cord compression, 
or compression of the C8 nerve roots bilaterally . There is also a mild slowing of the left 
ulnar nerve conduction below the elbow. This  neurologist, who has been on the case 
Whitworth, M.  v. Goldfinger T.R. 
Page 9 of 12 
 
since April of 1996, does not seem able or willin g to make a definitive statement as to the 
etiology of Ms. Whitworth’s cu rrent complaints. There is also a cervical spine CT scan 
dated 8-5-96, interpreted by Dr. Blair, which is said to di sclose a posterior osteophyte, 
midline and slightly to the left at C6 which, he noted, coul d conceivably cause 
compressive symptoms.  
 
It is noteworthy that Dr. Holt found a signifi cantly weaker left hand grasping power when 
he examined Ms. Whitworth on 10-30-95. However, Dr. Goldfinger, during his interrogation by the Expert Pane l, also noted that this sa me disparity was present on 
another examination as early as 1993. [It would thus have been reasonable for him to have discounted the finding in October of 1995 as relating to a more serious condition.] 
He also then found a positive foraminal co mpression sign, indicating early nerve root 
compression. He found some decrease in cervical spine range of motion, pain on motion, numbness in the hands, and other signs i ndicative of degenerative spinal disease 
throughout 1993. He apparently also felt there was evidence of some degree of disc 
disease and perhaps an old injury from the appearance of her cervical  spine radiographs. 
Even Ms. Whitworth recounted this conversation she had with Dr. Goldfinger about her x-rays in 1993 to the Expert Panel. 
 
It should also be remembered that the diag ram and pain descriptions reviewed by the 
Expert Panel on about 4-29-98, which were pr epared by Ms. Whitworth on that date, 
likely reflect a more severe pain and sympto m picture, due to the complication of the 
second disc herniation. This was less than three months before her second operation. 
These descriptions are not consistent with Dr. Bursell’s examination in 1996, where he described, for example, no pain other than the sensory discomfort, yet described her condition at the time as medically stationary. 
 
7. Any ongoing disability or impairment foll owing the first surgery appears to have 
been relatively minor and based, primarily, on subjective complaints. 
 
Based on the comprehensive disability evaluation of Dr. John Bursell (9-9-96), Ms. Whitworth continued to complain of subjec tive sensory abnormalities, mostly in the 
median arms, forearms, hands, thighs, and legs and feet. She complained of hypersensitivity (i.e., hyperesthesia) in her right forearm and hand. Her bowel and 
bladder function had not retu rned to normal (although, curiously, no details were 
provided concerning any ongoing problems). It is noteworthy, however, that more recently (2-9-99) Ms. Whitworth was evaluated by a urologist, a Dr. McCaughan. He performed a cystometrogram (a test of  bl adder function) and reported that “Maria’s 
water cystometrogram was entirely normal. ” Although she has some degree of urgency 
and stress incontinence, he noted, “It does not  seem very severe, in that she does not 
routinely use any protective pads, and onl y occasionally wets enough to soak clear 
through her clothes.” This examination appear s to have been entirely normal, and Dr. 
McCaughan’s conclusions regarding urgency and st ress incontinence appear to have been 
derived entirely from her statements to him. Stress incontinence is also often the result of 
multiple childbirths. Ms. Whitworth was la ter seen by a Dr. Malter (2-17-99) who 
examined her pelvic floor. He reported fi nding normal pelvic floor musculature and no 
Whitworth, M.  v. Goldfinger T.R. 
Page 10 of 12 
 
significant uterine prolapse or cystocel e prolapse when she bore down. Again, no 
objective evidence was noted that would ha ve accounted for stress incontinence. 
 
Dr. Bursell’s report continues: She no longe r had sexual difficulty. She complained of 
some clumsiness in her hands and some slapping of her feet. She continued to drive, work, and to be independent in activities of  daily living. Motor strength in the lower 
extremities was normal, as was that of the upper extremities, with the exception of the 
left triceps which was only slightly decrease d—a finding which, in fact, might be entirely 
consistent with the CT findings of 8-5-96, a nd unrelated to her industrial injury of 1995 
or her subsequent herniation at C6-7.  In either case it did not appear to cause any significant impairment. 
 
In considering the lower extremity sensory co mplaints/findings, one must also consider 
the fact that this woman ha s a congenital anomaly in her lumbosacral spine, along with 
documented “significant spinal stenosis” (MRI  report of 4-17-96) due to a combination of 
degenerative changes and a mild diffuse disc  bulge at L5-S1. Moreover, there is an 
“apparent narrowing of the right S1-S2 neur oforamen” due to what appeared to be 
degenerative changes. With the possible excep tion of the disc bulge, which could have 
occurred during her fall in October of 1995, these are all long -standing changes and 
predate the fall. These findings, however, ma y well have resulted lower extremity pain 
and sensory changes, both before and after her first surgery.  
 
Cervical spine range of motion was reported in vague terms (“approximately 45 degrees” 
in flexion, extension, left a nd right rotation, and no measurem ent of lateral flexion or 
description of how it was measured). No men tion of discomfort during these motions was 
reported. He also reported diminished sensit ivity to pinprick without making reference to 
the side. Presumably this finding was bilateral. Although she told him her gait was improved, but not yet normal, he reported her ga it and balance to be normal. Dr. Bursell 
also noted some findings consistent with ongoing myelopathy (Babin ski, alternating hand 
motions, etc.). He commented that her upper ex tremity symptoms were consistent with a 
C8 level distribution. Interestingly enough, there was no mention of pain  in his report 
and it appears that Ms. Whitworth was pain-fre e, aside from some hyperesthesia. He felt 
that she was medically stable at that point and ascribed a 26% whole person impairment, 
based on the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment . Such ratings are 
possible using these guides, but frequently are unrealistic. 
 
8. Ms. Whitworth appears to be laboring  under several misconceptions which are 
quite likely to be influential in how she views Dr. Goldfinger’s management of her case. Were she in possession of be tter factual information, one wonders 
whether she would view Dr. Goldfinger’ s treatment of her as reasonable and 
prudent. I suspect also that Ms. Whitworth’s opinions concerning the appropriateness of care delivered by  Dr. Goldfinger have been negatively 
influenced by reckless, offhand, inflam matory, and baseless comments made by 
other providers who treated her subsequently. 
 
Reasons for Opinion 8: 
Whitworth, M.  v. Goldfinger T.R. 
Page 11 of 12 
 
 
Ms. Whitworth was asked by the Expert Panel to explain why she felt Dr. Goldfinger was 
responsible for her current situ ation. Her answer was that he  should have taken an x-ray 
of her neck or a head x-ray. And, had he done that, he would have seen the disc lesion and she would not now have permanent spinal cord damage. She continued by stating that her comments seemed to be based on something the neurosurgeon said to her about large chunks of fragmented disc  and that he couldn’t see w hy that would have occurred 
with just a herniated disc. She felt that  Dr. Goldfinger had “chunked my disc.”  
 
Apparently, during his initial c onsultation with her, Dr. Smythi es indicated to her that she 
could have fallen or had her neck adjusted [i.e., by Dr. Goldfinger] and been rendered 
quadriplegic or dead. As to th e conversation about chunks of di sc, this is entirely hearsay, 
but it is interesting to note that the operative report from  the 1998 surgery—on a disc 
level that was essentially nor mal in 1996—describes how “several  free fragments of disc 
were removed until the dura was completely  decompressed.” Are these the “chunks” she 
refers too? 
 
In sharp contrast to Ms. Whitworth’s beliefs, it is not possible to see a disc herniation 
with neck or skull x-rays. Dr. Goldfinger told  the Expert Panel that he had a prior x-ray 
of Ms. Whitworth’s cervical spine and, based on her presen tation on 10-30-95, he did not 
think that another x-ray was warranted. In hindsight, that was the case, because there 
were no lesions, such as fractures, that might  have been seen with a new x-ray. Free 
fragments or “chunks” are commonly remove d from disc spaces during surgical 
procedures, as apparently they were duri ng the second surgery. I question the relevance 
of this issue. 
 
In their extensive 1-13-99 ev aluation of Ms. Whitworth, Drs. Thompson and Zivvin make 
concluding remarks that warrant  discussion. Parenthetically, they add that in reviewing 
the record, there is certainly a serious questi on raised as to the role of the chiropractic 
manipulations in the ultimate massive disc he rniation at C6-7. They state, “One would 
have to be seriously concerned whether th e cervical manipulations in the face of a 
moderate disc herniation at C6-7, might we ll have caused the more massive protrusion. 
We do not question the fact that she undoubtedly  had some degree of disc protrusion at 
C6-7, as a result of the October, 1995 inci dent. However, at th at point, there is no 
evidence in the record that this was going to cause her a serious problem, had it been 
treated appropriately, rather than  treated with manipulations.” 
 
The implication that chiropractic care is not appropriate for disc bulges or herniations is 
obvious. The bias against chiropractic treatment,  or at least spinal manipulation, is clear 
here. However, in point of fact, chiropract ors do successfully treat patients with disc 
herniations, often preventing more invasive surgical procedures. Moreover, many disc 
bulges and herniations regress (i.e., cease to bulge) with treatment. This treatment is widely employed and accepted in the chiropr actic profession and is well within the 
standard of care in the community. Moreove r, there is no good scientific evidence 
supporting the doctors’ statements that spinal manipulation is inappropriate, or that it is 
likely to cause or aggravate a herniation. One wonders, however , what the effect of such 
Whitworth, M.  v. Goldfinger T.R. 
Page 12 of 12 
 
an unqualified and inflammatory comment is  likely to have on someone who is not 
familiar with the misconceptions and biases of some members of the medical profession.

VIA FAX 
 
Dear ___, 
 
This letter concerns the copy of the letter you sent me which was addressed 
to Dr. __________ from Rebecca I. Holbrook, of the Farmers Insurance 
Exchange. As promised, I have done some  further checking into this issue. 
First, this is clearly a form letter that is being sent out of the Farmers National 
Document Center in Oklahoma City. I ha ve a virtual verbatim duplicate letter 
which was sent to a colleague in La s Vegas recently. In fact, the only 
variance, was in the paragraph which read: 
 
According to the Medical Disability Advisor: Guideline for Disability 
Duration , by Dr. Presley Reed, 2001 ed ition, the standard practice for 
length of treatment for the type of in jury your patient sustained is from 
2 to 12 weeks. Our policy states that we will pay for reasonable and 
necessary treatment as related to injuries sustained in the above accident. 
 
The variance I noted between thes e two documents was in the quoted 
treatment duration (2 to 8 weeks in the Las Vegas letter). I am assuming that 
the “condition” in this case was whiplash.  
 
According to my copy of the 4th (2001) edition of The Medical Disability 
Advisor: Workplace Guidelines for Disability Duration , under the section of 
“sprains and strains, cervical sp ine (neck),” beginning on page 1981—and 
this is cataloged in the index under the term “whiplas h” and describes injuries 
in which an individual’s “car is hit fr om the rear”—no such wording is to be 
found. The authors describe only the length of disability, in days, on the basis 
of the patient’s type of work (from sede ntary to very heavy) and in terms of 
quartiles and measures of central tendency (mean, median, etc.).  
 
I should think that the recommendations of Dr. Reed in his Preface are being 
violated in principle, as evidenced by these two identical form letters. Dr. 
Reed specifically stated: 
 
The Medical Disability Advisor  is intended to be used as a tool against 
which the user should weigh the to tality of his or her available 
knowledge and the specific inform ation [of the individual case]. And, 
Please use this tool judiciously , tempering your decisions with 
thoughtfulness and compassion.

This book is designed to d eal with the difficult issu e of absenteeism in the 
workplace (one wonders whether the Fa rmers agent’s omission of the word 
“Workplace” in the book’s title was accident al), and the tables and graphs of 
durations of disability apply only to  absenteeism or pe riods of partial 
disability in the workplace. They do not address the issue of treatment 
durations, nor do they make any referen ce to the “standard practices” of any 
profession. Under the heading “specialists,” chiropracto rs are listed and it is 
noted that it “may provide symptomatic and functional relief.” There is, however, no discussion of duration of  treatment. Thus, the comments 
emanating from the National Document Center are likely either based on misinterpretations of this book arising out of an incomplete understanding of 
workers compensation disability/impair ment core issues, or a purposeful 
misrepresentation of the f acts as pretext for denial of services of medical 
care, or some type intentional, systematic harassment. 
 
Under the heading “Prognosis,” in the whiplash section, the authors make some interesting, if ambiguous, comments. They first note that, while healing is expected  in a few weeks, in 20-70% of cases, patients remain symptomatic 
after 6 months. They note, however, that  most of these patients eventually 
recover. Yet, in the very next paragr aph, they acknowledge the fact that as 
many as a third will be symptomatic even  10 years after the injury. They also 
acknowledge a variety of risk factors which might make the outcome less favorable, such as female sex, incr easing age, reduced range of motion, 
multiple symptoms, neurological deficit, or headaches. These would presumably be some of the factors which would require thoughtfulness and 
compassion.   
 
Finally, I point out that most of th e recommendations made by the Reed 
Group can be found in the pages of my textbook and I find little to disagree 
with him on, aside from a few errone ous facts he presented (e.g., 1 million 
such injuries occur yearly in the U.S.). Interestingly, though, only two 
references are presented at the back of this chapter.

FROM THE MOMENT I GRADUATED I HAVE TREATED 
NEUROPATHOLOGY.  I have discovered, however, that many 
patients do not know chiropractors treat neuropathy. 
Only a small percentage of people truly understand what 
chiropractors do and that we treat more than back pain. 
Our goal is to educate the public that treating conditions 
such as degenerative disc disease and idiopathic peripheral 
neuropathy are the 
essence of what we do.
To treat idiopathic 
peripheral neuropathy 
doctors must 
understand its 
symptoms, which 
include numbness or 
altered sensations, such 
as feeling like a bunched 
sock is under the toes. 
Idiopathic (the underlying cause of nerve damage is unknown) 
peripheral neuropathy (damage to the nerves in the legs and 
arms) typically begins in the longest nerves first, usually in 
the toes and feet. These can be debilitating to the patient. 
This condition can have significant symptoms, yet some 
patients notice no symptoms at all. The Cleveland Clinic 
estimates that 25 to 30 percent of Americans will be affected 
by peripheral neuropathy. They estimate 30 to 40 percent CLINICAL  
CONCERNS
THE TAKEAWAY
You can be a game changer with patients suffering from 
peripheral neuropathy. There are many natural options 
chiropractors can offer to help provide relief, such as 
adjustments, laser therapy, and supplements. There is an 
opportunity to become a leader in offering patients a long-term 
solution to neuropathy. YOU CAN CHANGE

of peripheral neuropathy cases are 
idiopathic in nature. 
Utilizing laser, LED therapy, and 
electroanalgesics has been shown to 
have a tremendous success rate—some 
studies show up to a 90 percent success 
rate, especially when you supplement the 
patients with nitric oxide. 
The basics of peripheral neuropathy
Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can 
include numbness, tingling, pain, and 
oversensitivity to touch. Strange altered 
sensations may be present. Patients 
describe the feeling they have as a sock 
bunched under their toes even though 
they are not wearing a sock. 
Others report it feels as if they are 
walking on leather or rocks or have 
something wrapped around their feet. 
Sometimes a stimulus that normally is 
not painful is perceived as painful, such 
as a sheet touching a foot.
Some people do not notice any 
symptoms at all. These patients do not 
realize they have lost sensation in their 
feet as the loss has been so gradual that 
it seems normal. They have no abnormal 
or strange sensations in their feet, but 
may lose balance gradually or develop a 
painless sore on their foot that normally 
would be expected to be painful.  
Peripheral neuropathy can lead to 
loss of balance, weakness, hammer toes, 
and foot deformity, which may require 
the use of a cane, walker, or foot braces, 
if severe. The condition typically worsens 
as a person ages. 
Loss of sensation in the feet can be 
serious. A person can develop a foot 
sore they do not feel, even if it becomes 
severely infected. This can lead to 
amputation of toes or legs and, in rare 
cases, death. 
The loss of balance associated with 
peripheral neuropathy also is very 
serious, as it puts a person at higher 
risk of falls. Falls can have catastrophic 
consequences. This is why diagnosis and 
treatment protocols are so important.
Falls are the most common cause of 
injury in elderly adults (age 65 and older). 
As many as one third of elderly adults 
fall each year and the risk of falling 
triples if you have a neurologic disorder 
such as peripheral neuropathy. Twenty to 30 percent of older people 
who fall suffer moderate to severe 
injuries, such as hip fractures and head 
traumas. These injuries can be life-
altering and even deadly. According to 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, falls kill more than 18,000 
older adults each year.
Why we fall
Balance is the ability to maintain the 
body’s center of mass over its base of 
support. A properly functioning balance 
system allows humans to see clearly 
while moving, identify orientation with 
respect to gravity, determine direction 
and speed of movement, and make 
automatic postural adjustments to 
maintain posture and stability in various 
conditions and activities. 
Balance depends on the coordination 
of input from multiple sensory systems:
Visual : Provides information on the 
verticality of the body and spatial 
location relative to objects.
Proprioception : Provides information 
from skin (touch) and joints (pressure 
and vibratory senses).
Vestibular:  Our sense organs that 
provide information on direction, 
motion, equilibrium, and spatial 
orientation.
Our bodies need to integrate this 
sensory input and translate that into 
motor output to the eye and body 
muscles. Maintaining balance depends 
on information received by the brain 
from three peripheral sources: eyes, 
muscles and joints, and vestibular 
organs. All three of these sources send 
information to the brain in the form 
of nerve impulses from special nerve 
endings called sensory receptors. 
Peripheral neuropathy is a disorder 
of the motor, sensory, and autonomic 
nerves. So, in addition to aging, 
peripheral neuropathy patients are at a 
greater risk of falling because numbness, 
decreased sensitivity to touch, and 
muscle weakness can have significant 
adverse effects on their balance. CLINICAL CONCERNS

 36 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS • FEBRUARY 22, 2019 CHIROECO.COM
Evaluation and diagnosis
To diagnose a peripheral neuropathy as 
idiopathic, you must first evaluate for 
treatable causes of peripheral neuropathy:
An electromyography (EMG) test 
can evaluate for a demyelinating 
peripheral neuropathy. 
Blood work that includes hemoglobin 
A1C to evaluate for pre-diabetes; a 
vitamin B12 blood test (with the goal 
being a number greater than 400); a 
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 
test to rule out hypothyroidism; and a 
serum protein electrophoresis test are 
all advised.
If the peripheral neuropathy is 
idiopathic, all of these lab tests will 
be normal.
Excessive alcohol use, based on 
patient history, also can determine 
peripheral neuropathy.
Monitor feet for any sores or cuts, 
and give care vigilantly if a wound is 
discovered. 
Treatment options
Here are several suggestions to prevent 
and treat peripheral neuropathy:
Use medications to help neuropathic 
pain. These include Neurontin 
(Gabapentin), Lyrica (Pregabalin) 
and Cymbalta (Duloxetine). These 
medications only help with pain; 
they do not correct numbness or balance problems and do not slow the 
progression of neuropathy as we age. 
They also carry the risk of dizziness, 
which can increase fall risk even further.
Shun excess vitamin B6. Doses 
greater than 100 mg per day are toxic 
to the nerves and actually cause 
nerve damage. 
Avoid falls—eliminate throw rugs, have 
a night light, or use a cane or walker for 
safety. Most falls occur inside the home.
Don’t smoke; limit alcohol intake.
Apply laser treatment, which may help 
temporarily with pain, but does not fix 
numbness or cure neuropathy.
Take available supplements, such as 
alpha lipoic acid, although they are 
uncertain to be of benefit. 
Exercise is a must! Regular exercise, 
such as walking, improves circulation, 
helps control weight, and helps 
maintain balance. Strengthening 
exercises for the back, legs, and 
core improve balance. A 2012 study 
of balance disorders in diabetic 
peripheral neuropathy patients 
showed that patients could achieve 
better balance and stability through 
progressive balance training. The study 
recommended that training be gradual 
and persistent so as to have long-
term effects on the patient. Clinical studies also have shown that Tai Chi 
helps stabilize gait, improve balance, 
and reduce falls among people with 
peripheral neuropathy.
Idiopathic peripheral neuropathy 
is very frustrating when it is found in 
a patient who is otherwise healthy. 
Knowledge about the condition is 
important. Ruling out treatable causes 
of peripheral neuropathy is imperative. 
Knowing that peripheral neuropathy 
increases the risk of falls can lead a 
person to be more careful and help 
prevent a fall. Medication treatment can 
help with neuropathic pain symptoms, 
but as chiropractors we know treating 
the symptoms alone will not be a cure. 
We must detect the regions of 
kinesiopathology subluxations, while 
treating these pathophysiologies 
with chiropractic care to remove 
the nerve interference, with laser to 
assist in stimulating the cells and with 
electroanalgesics to reduce symptoms 
while healing nerves and increasing 
circulation. This, combined with 
proper nutrition and supplementation, 
actually positions chiropractors and the 
chiropractic profession to be the leaders 
in both disc and neuropathy treatment.

Why are you on social media in the first place?
If your answer is a resounding “Uhh…” or “Everyone else is on it,” you might have a problem. The concept of SMART 
goals has been around for decades, but they are so important to your social media presence today. In short, practices 
should set goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.
An example of a good SMART goal for social media marketing would be something like “We’ll increase our Twitter 
response rate by 25 percent by the end of the first quarter.”
Specific: We’ve specifically identified the social channel (Twitter) and a metric (response rate).
Measurable: The response rate can be measured from the Google analytics dashboard.
Achievable: We didn’t make an outlandish goal of say, a 100 percent increase in 10 days.
Relevant: Our goal will have an impact on our overall social media presence, making it very relevant.
Time-bound: The goal has to be met by the end of the first quarter.

Both seniors playing the front line. 
One feels a pop in his neck, and the next day his neck hurts and his pinkie finger is tingling. 
Being a regular patient in the office, I 
examine him and rule out cervical disc. ROM is only mildly guarded, and there is no edema or discoloration on the neck. 
Two adjustments and ice therapy, and 
he’s back on the field within a week.

The second buddy feels a pop in his 
neck in practice while hitting a tackling dummy.
Recommended by his friend, his mom 
brings him in for the same treatment two days later. 
Upon palpation there’s obvious 
splinting in the traps, with palpable edema and pain around C7-T1. 
The mother fought me on x-rays, just 
wanting her son’s neck “cracked”.
Needless to say, I didn’t crack his neck that day. 
Clay Shoveler’s fractures are NOT 
subtle stress fractures. Because of the muscle splinting, there will be an obvious gap. The next step would be flexion and extension views, or an MRI, to determine if the Ligamentum Nuchae is torn. Surgery is only recommended if the avulsion is unstable. 
I referred the patient out for this step.

Erick was a pitcher for Oakland University 
in Michigan, a school known for prepping major league pitchers. He was on the injured reserve list for 6 months, having been through PT and every test the trainers could throw at him. He just couldn’t get the pain out of his shoulder, and he was scheduled for exploratory surgery. 
He came to me largely out of desperation, 
as I’d taught his mother (a massage therapist.) His pain was on the anterior humeral head, worse when his arm was extended behind him, and at the beginning of his forward motion. Some pain on abduction as well.

• Separation  (AcromioClavicular)
• GlenoHumeral Labrum  Tear
No palpable tenderness in the rotator cuff 
tendons, nor is there swelling or discomfort in the AC joint, ruling out Rotator cuff tear, AC separation.
Point tenderness is revealed on the 
anterior portion of the head of the humerus, leading us to suspect bicipital tendonitis over impingement syndrome or labrum tear. 
• Bicipital Tendonitis
• Impingement  Syndrome
•G l e n o H u m e r a l L a b r u m  Tear
All three exhibit increased pain upon 
abduction, however, Impingement syndrome will be painful more on the superior aspect of the humeral head, and the labrum tear will have no discrete palpable tenderness.
3 treatments (chiropractic adjustments as well, of course).
Within the week Eric was back to 
throwing 95 MPH laser beams, and was soon drafted to the Seattle Mariners.

John is an aggressive forward in our 40+ 
co-ed soccer league. (Sorry, no picture of John. This is my superstar, Sarah.)
Winding up for a shot on goal, John felt a 
sharp, stabbing pain at the base of  his spine that stopped him in his tracks. After icing and resting, he reported no pain unless he moved the wrong way, even just shifting weight on his feet. 
Si joint pain or Facet syndrome?
S.I. Joint pain :
¾Pain is stabbing, all-or-nothing pain with 
certain  weightbearing movements¾Frequently the fixated joint is asymptomatic
¾Treat Golgi tendon of Sartorius on side 
opposite pain¾Responds well to ice therapy
Facet Joint pain :
¾Pain is stabbing with extension, 
weightbearing motion, especially rising from chair¾Responds gradually to ice therapy
John returned to full “Weekend Warrior” 
status within 2 treatments. (Credit to my other daughter Jessica for this action shot)

Dave is a 50 year old, playing in a pickup 
hockey league. He gets out once, maybe twice a week. He’s been getting progressively intense posterior leg pain under his left buttock traveling inferior, after a game, and most of the following day.
Pain in posterior thigh increased with 
seated SLR and slump test, but no increased pain with Valsalva’s or Kemps.
Pain does not extend distal to the knee. No antalgic stance. Sitting is palliative, not 
provocative. NO bruising or discoloration.
In this case, the mechanism of forcefully accelerating on skates caused spasticity to his piriformis muscle, which put pressure on the sciatic nerve. 
Treating with stretching and deep tissue 
massage concurrent with adjustments resolved the issue.

Alex came to me in desperation for help with his headaches. He was a 
promising 14 yr old that was already being scouted for basketball, but they were threatening to keep him back a year in school because he’d missed so often due to debilitating headaches. They’d tried all the medications, been to the University of Michigan Children’s hospital and the Mayo clinic. He incidentally complained of medial knee pains on both sides from practice. 
During the exam I commented that the worn shoes he was wearing (untied) were unacceptable, and explained that I wanted supportive shoes that were laced.  Nothing  more was remarkable; I treated him and they left. 
They didn’t return for a month.
When Alex finally returned for care, he excitedly proclaimed that he’d been 
headache free for a whole month, and his knee pain was gone!
In the two years following that visit, EVERY time he reported a headache, it 
could be linked to poor shoe hygiene, or overworn shoes. 
Had the knee pain persisted, I’d have considered MCL injury, but it resolved with proper shoe support without further investigation.

¾LASER is an acronym for “light amplification  by stimulated  
emission  of radiation .” This theory was introduced  by Einstein 
in 1917, but the first working laser wasn’t in use until the late 
1960’s.
¾LLLT is “non‐destructive” ,  often referred to as “Cold Laser” as 
it is below the threshold  that produces  heat.
¾To date there are more than 130double‐blind positive studies 
confirming  the clinical effects of LLLT. More than 3000 research 
reports have been published.  
80
Primary  Effects : Direct effect: Photobiomodulation produces  changes in 
oxidation/reduction  status of the mitochondria.  This leads to significant  
increases  in ATP synthesis.  
Most predictable  and reliable effect.
Secondary  Effects : Occurring  in the same cells as primary stimulation;  effects 
include growth factor secretion,  degranulation,  cell proliferation,  
neurotransmitter  modification,  etc. Less predictable  due to outside factors.
Tertiary Effects : Systemic  effects on adjacent and nonadjacent  cells as a result 
of primary and secondary  effects. Influenced  by other factors, while the most 
clinically  significant,  tertiary effects are least reliable. 
81Stimulate  cell growth; increase cellular metabolism;  
stimulate  anti‐inflammatory  response;  reduce edema; 
reduce the formation  of fibrous tissue; stimulate  nerve 
function;  increase production  of endorphins.

6NotesMany business-deduction strategies remain unchanged for dozens and 
dozens of years, so your efforts pay off for dozens and dozens of years. In 
a way, much of this knowledge is like an annuity, giving you an investment 
return for many years. 
For Whom Is This Course Designed?
This course is for one-owner or husband-and-wife businesses. In general, 
the course applies to all
l Independent contractors
l Statutory employees 
l Husband-and-wife businesses
l Partnerships owned by husband and wife only
l Corporations owned by one person or by a husband and wife 
l LLCs owned by one person or by a husband and wife
The course is not designed for the W-2 employee who claims employee 
business expenses using a Form 2106. Further, although a useful reference, 
the course is not designed for the multiple-owner business because the 
strategies in this course are designed to benefit only the owner (one person 
or the husband-and-wife unit). 
How the Course Works for You
The tax strategies course consists of three inextricably intertwined compo -
nents:
1. The workbook reference source,
2. The audio CDs, and
3. An on-line video.
The three intertwined parts (workbook, CDs, and on-line video) work to -
gether in an easy and enjoyable way to produce the benefits you are look -
ing for.
According to renowned consultant Jay Abraham, the audio CDs are about 
667 percent more effective than a one-day live seminar. Abraham says that 
you leave a live seminar remembering about 15 percent of the informa -
tion, even when you have a comprehensive supporting workbook. 
Psychologists suggest listening to information multiple times to improve 
comprehension and integrate the information into your daily repertoire.  
The retained comprehension part is a big reason we changed our educa -
tional strategy to this three-pronged approach. With the CDs, you can 
enjoy passive learning with excellent comprehension, by putting the CDs 
in your car and listening while driving (and while not driving, when wait -
ing for the traffic to move). 
 7NotesYou might want to use the CDs in concert with building endorphins, by 
listening while running or working out at the gym. This makes for happy 
tax advice.
The CDs are the first step to your understanding. The CDs, workbook, and 
on-line video are intertwined and interrelated, but not redundant. With the 
CDs, you will hear word-picture examples that make tax-saving strategies 
clear. Listen to the CDs first, with the workbook nowhere in sight.
We designed the CDs with tracks so you can skip around and choose the 
things you want to learn. Some sections contain several tracks so you 
can skip information inside a section as well as skip section to section. In 
general, sections and tracks give the complete story for a strategy or set of 
strategies, including the tax records needed. If a track is dependent on ad -
ditional information, the track will direct you to that information. 
You have probably heard the expression that a picture is worth a thousand 
words. We believe in the picture theory and use it extensively in the on-
line video to show you ways to audit-proof your records. Tax law is very 
specific on the types of records you need. The on-line video makes it fast 
and easy for you to see how the records should look. 
This reference book plays a vital role in the learning process, giving you 
easy-to-read breakdowns of the tax rules, followed by great examples. But 
the book does not stand alone in the tax-strategies course learning process. 
Think of the book as one of three legs holding up a chair. Take away any 
of the legs and the chair falls over. It takes three legs to make the chair 
work, like it takes the three parts of this course to clarify taxes so that you 
take control of your money.
Note the extensive references at the end of most every section of this refer -
ence book. The annotations are for you. The annotations are for your tax 
advisors. The annotations show how each strategy complies with the law .
Why You Need This Course
When you went into business for yourself, you entered into a partnership 
agreement with the government. That partnership agreement, called the 
tax law, governs how you split the money you earn between yourself and 
the government.  
The Tax Foundation, a think tank in Washington, D.C., says that taxes 
cost you more money than any other single expense, including housing 
and food. This is a lot of money, so it makes sense to pay attention to your 
taxes. 
8NotesAs a one-person or husband-and-wife business, it is doubtful that you 
could pay someone to take care of the taxes related to your business in -
come. After all
l You are the one who spends the money. 
l You are the one who needs to know what is deductible.
l You are the one who keeps the record of the expense.
l You are the one who has to comply with special requirements, like 
keeping a vehicle mileage log and recording the proper elements of 
support for travel and entertainment.
l You are the one who needs to ask the questions of your accountant.
l You are the one who provides the information to your accountant.
In other words, you are on the front-lines where most deductions are won 
and lost. This course gives you the weapons and tools you need to build 
your net worth and sleep better at night. 
Why Your Accountant Cannot Do This for You
Your accountant does not know your business like you know your busi -
ness. Your accountant does not care about your business like you care 
about your business. This is no fault of your accountant, who has many 
clients in many businesses. You are the expert on your business.
Expecting your accountant to take care of your taxes is like expecting your 
dentist to take care of your teeth. Your dentist could take care of your 
teeth. All your dentist would have to do is stop by your home every morn -
ing and evening to brush and floss your teeth for you. 
Similarly, your accountant could take care of your taxes. All your accoun -
tant would have to do is follow you around all day and 
l make notes every time you used something (noting both personal and 
business use in many cases),
l obtain receipts for your business purchases that require receipts as 
proof,
l make notes about certain expenditures that require specific notes, 
including those where receipts are not required,
l pay the bills,
l file the receipts, and 
l summarize the information for your tax return.
To do all this, your accountant would have to have only one client—you!
In fact, how often do you see your accountant? Once a year? Even if you 
see your accountant often, like really often—say every day—you still need 
this course. Why? Your accountant does not have time to do what we do 
for you.
 9NotesHere are four reasons your accountant does not do what we do (or you 
could say, four reasons you would not want to pay your accountant to do 
what this course does for you).
1. Research just for you:  The principal author of this work, W . Murray 
Bradford, CPA, spends an average of 80 hours a month researching the 
tax law for benefits that the one-owner business can put to use. He also has 
a staff, outside writers, and a cadre of highly placed enrolled agents, CPAs, 
and tax lawyer colleagues he calls on for ideas and advice.
He charges $350 an hour for his time. The 80 hours is worth $28,000 a 
month! That’s what it takes each month to put you under our protection as 
a client of this tax strategies course. 
And it has taken us years to build this course. Mr. Bradford, just one of the 
contributors to this body of knowledge, has been researching, studying, 
and teaching tax strategies for small business people like you for the past 
27 years. In other words, he alone has invested more than 25,000 hours in 
learning not only your tax issues, but how to make them come to life for 
your benefit.
Your accountant cannot do this on your behalf. First, your accountant 
must bill for time spent researching tax issues. It is unlikely that he or she 
has either the time available for non-billable research, or clients willing to 
pay for 80 hours of research a month. 
Second, if for some strange reason your accountant had 80 hours of time 
for research during a month, that research would probably focus on far 
more issues than your small business deductions, including issues like 
l Death and estate taxes
l Business reviews
l Audits
l Litigation support
l Sales taxes
l Payroll taxes
l Compliance with ERISA  
l Gift taxes
l Acquisition reviews
l Compliance with general accounting principles
l Business valuations
l Workers’ compensation
l State income taxes
l Financial statement preparation and review
l Personal property taxes
l Insurance
10Notesl Formal compliance reviews
l Loan covenant reviews and audits
l Unemployment
l The inner dealings of multi-owner corporations
l Internal control reviews
l Compliance difficulties with general and limited partnerships
l Foundation compliance
l Endowment reviews
l Grant writing, reviews, and audits
l Personal financial planning, plans, and investment reviews
l Divorce planning
l Succession planning
Most of these issues have nothing to do with you and your tax situation. 
Unlike your accountant, we do one thing and one thing only: We concen -
trate on the day-to-day small buisness tax issues that pertain to the one-
owner or husband-and-wife-owned business. 
2. Research for you from the best sources:  In all likelihood, we subscribe 
to more and better tax services than your accountant subscribes to. In our 
headquarters office, we subscribe to U.S. Tax Reporter, RIA, BNA Tax 
Management Portfolios, Parker Tax, PPC, Tax Analysts Tax Notes, Tax 
Facts, Warren Gorham and Lamont, Matthew Bender, and LexisNexis. 
Most practicing accountants who deal with one-owner businesses sub -
scribe to one service, maybe two at most. 
Again, nothing against your accountant here, but your accountant has to 
do much more than just find deductions for you. The thousands we spend 
for such a wide variety of resources makes no sense in a private practice. 
Accountants in private practice spend most of their time doing the work 
and talking to the clients about a variety of issues. 
We have only you, the one-person or husband-and-wife business. You are 
our one-and-only issue. We devote our time and resources to you.
 
3. Narrow definition makes our materials apply to you: You are like Mr. 
Bradford’s dad. He operated a small business as a sole proprietorship. Mr. 
Bradford knows who you are and what you do from morning until night. 
He has been studying you and the tax laws that apply to you since 1979, 
when he left the international accounting firm of Price Waterhouse to 
get into the business of supplying tax strategies for the small businesss. 
His definition of a small business is the one-owner or husband-and-wife-
owned business. 
We don’t care how you operate this one-owner business. You can be a 
corporation, partnership, LLC, or proprietorship. You can even be a life 
 11Notesinsurance agent paid as a statutory employee (independent contractor for 
all purposes other than FICA, Medicare, and certain fringe benefits). We 
like salespeople, medical people, and franchise owners. You benefit from 
this course when you meet the criteria stated (i.e., you are the owner, or 
you and your spouse own the business together). 
Our narrow definition of the small business gives us the ability to really 
focus on you. Many accountants do not like you as a client. In fact, very 
few accountants specialize in one-owner businesses, and even those that 
specialize are taken off track by the variety of other issues that arise, like 
death of the sole owner and inheritance by the three chrildren (hence three 
owners). 
4. Easy for you to understand and use:  You will learn and apply the ma -
terial in this course because we designed it for your understanding. This is 
not like talking taxes with your accountant. 
Mr. Bradford has a unique ability to take complicated material and make 
it understandable. This “taking the complicated to comprehensible and 
usable” is what led to his highly regarded appointment to a tour of duty 
in the Washington, D.C., national office of Price Waterhouse many years 
ago. He did not disappoint. In an unusual move, Price Waterhouse extend -
ed his original tour from two years to four years.
During his tour of duty, his job was to write and teach complicated mate -
rial to nonaccountants. He taught many groups, big and small, throughout 
the United States. He listened and learned a great deal. Then he took that 
knowledge with him; ever since, he has been applying it to your tax situa -
tion. 
Professional educators and communicators have spent over 500 hours 
reviewing our materials for both accuracy and interest level. We keep you 
alert, enthused, and learning all of the time you have our materials in your 
hands. 
As to quality of material and relevancy to your morning-to-night business 
activities, we average better than 9.67 on a 10-point scale. You will like our 
teaching style and you will thank us for your clear understanding of the 
materials. 
Why Your Accountant Will Thank You for Taking 
This Course
Your accountant cannot do for you what this course does for you. In fact, 
your completion of this course will put a smile on your accountant’s face 
because you will become
12Notesl an accurate record keeper who does not have to worry about docu -
mentation, and 
l an informed taxpayer who now asks good questions.
People always complain that their accountants are never aggressive 
enough on their behalf. Would you be aggressive on behalf of someone 
you doubt? Would you be aggressive on behalf of the person you think has 
bad records? Of course not! 
Your accountant may think (or know) that you are a terrible record keeper. 
Most taxpayers who have not had this course are bad record keepers. 
Why? Lack of knowledge! Tax rules on the required records vary by the 
type of deduction, but by following the principles in this course, you will 
have the records you need that allow your accountant to be aggressive on 
your behalf. Further, this course shows you how to keep those records in a 
minimum of time (probably far less than you are spending right now).
Have you ever asked a question that seems ridiculous to your accountant? 
Have you ever asked a question that makes your accountant think you 
want to circumvent the system? Such questions make your accountant 
really nervous. This can happen when you have no desire whatsoever to 
do anything wrong, but the question makes it appear so. No longer. This 
course gives you a base of knowledge that allows you to ask your accoun -
tant questions that lead to results. You get the tax savings you deserve and 
your accountant is confident about “locking it in” for you—both of you 
are happy.
Get Started Now!
Don’t waste a minute. Get started now! Put the CDs in your car or other 
listening device and start listening. You do not need the workbook with 
you. The CDs stand alone. You can listen anywhere, anytime. 
The CDs allow you to skip and jump around to topics of particular inter -
est to you. You can start anywhere, right now . 
Listen to the CDs before watching the on-line video. Why? The on-line 
video is a supplement that shows you how to document various deduc -
tions discussed in the CDs. Think of the CDs as the meat of the course, 
with the book and on-line video as condiments that make everything taste 
better. 
Okay! Stop reading now . Pop in the CDs and start protecting yourself with 
knowledge! Start making and saving money right this minute!
 13Notes Section 2
Travel Rule Basics and How to 
Put Them to Work for You
Definition:  Tax law allows you to deduct travel expenses incurred while 
away from home in pursuit of business.1 If your trip required you to sleep 
or rest away from your principal place of business, you were away from 
home and in travel status.2 
Example 1: Homer Correll drove 150 to 175 miles a day in his sales terri -
tory. He traveled no farther than 55 miles from his home. He left home at 
5:00 a.m. and returned at 5:30 p.m. He tried to deduct breakfast and lunch 
as travel expenses. The Supreme Court said "no deductions" because Cor -
rell did not require sleep or rest.3
 
Example 2:  Frederick Barry, a consulting engineer, traveled three states to 
service his clients. He left home at 6:30 a.m. and returned at midnight. For 
a break, he stopped in rest areas and closed his eyes for 15 to 20 minutes. 
No deduction! The Tax Court ruled that Barry's sleep did not add to his 
expense or put him in travel status to deduct his meal expenses.4 
Pursuit of business: You pursue your business when you pursue your cur -
rent livelihood. This requires much more effort than entering an activity to 
make a profit.5 You travel in pursuit of your business when your travel is:
l Appropriate and helpful to the development and maintenance of your 
business6 
l With the intent to secure a business benefit7
l Customary and usual within your business community8
When you travel in pursuit of your existing business needs, your travel is 
deductible immediately as a business expense.9 The law allows the deduc -
tion for "carrying on" the business and thus presumes that the business 
already exists.
Two categories of expenses:  Your travel expenses fall into one of two 
categories:
1. Transportation-to-business-destination expenses
2. Business-day expenses
You pay airfare and car expenses to transport yourself to a business desti -
nation. While there, you incur business-day expenses like eating food and 
sleeping in a hotel. You may deduct food and lodging on business days, 
even when your trip does not include enough business days to make it a 
business trip.10
14NotesExample: Your trip from New York to Phoenix lasts five days. You work 
only one day. You may deduct the costs of food and lodging for the one 
day of work, but you deduct nothing for transportation.
Deductible Business Days Come from a Variety 
of Sources 
Rule: For each business day of travel, you may deduct lodging, 50 percent 
of your meal costs, and incidentals.
Foreign rules are clear: Tax law contains clear examples of business 
days for foreign travel. Although the definitions for foreign deductions 
are generally stricter than those for domestic travel, they provide a defini -
tion guideline that is highly useful. Following are the stricter foreign travel 
definitions for business days.
Work days: You count as a business day any day during which your prin -
cipal activity during normal business hours is the pursuit of business.11 In 
other words, you must work more than half of the work day. 
Tried-to-work days:  You count as a business day any day when circum -
stances beyond your control prevented you from actively pursuing your 
business objective.12
Weekends, holidays, and standby days: Weekends, holidays, and other 
necessary standby days count as business days when sandwiched by busi -
ness days during a trip you conduct with reasonable dispatch.13 The week -
end rule applies only where it would not be practical to return home from 
your business destination for the weekend because of time required or 
expense involved.
Saturday night travel:  Airlines generally charge you less if you stay at 
your destination over a Saturday night. If you save money by staying over 
Saturday night, you count the stayover days as business days.14
Travel days:  Travel days are business days.15 To ensure business-day status, 
your total portal-to-portal in-transit and business activity time for the day 
should exceed four hours. 
Deductible Methods of Transportation
Rule:  You may transport yourself to and from a business destination by:16
l Automobile
l Airplane
 15Notesl Train
l Boat
It makes no difference if your car is large or small, if you fly coach or first 
class, or if it is a private plane. Transportation costs are deductible in full, 
except for luxury boats.
Car strategy—transport family 300 miles toward business destination:  
Consider driving your car on a combined business and pleasure trip. When 
you drive 300 miles in a direct route toward the destination, the day counts 
as a business day, just as it does for an IRS agent.17 Therefore, you:
l Count the day as a business day to satisfy the 51/49 test.
l Deduct costs for sustaining life while on the road that day.
Meals and lodging expenses of family members other than the taxpayer do 
not qualify for deduction. If the cost of lodging is $80 for one person and 
$95 for the family, you deduct only $80.
Example:  You put the family in the car and drive from Chicago to Wash -
ington, D.C., for a three-day convention. The drive takes two days each 
way. You spend 6 days sightseeing. Your trip is primarily business because 
you spent 7 of 13 days on business. You deduct:
l 100 percent of the transportation, and 
l 7 days of sustaining business life on the road costs (for yourself only).
Big Changes in Cruise Ship Deduction Limits 
for 2017
Say you are going to travel to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands for a one-
day business seminar and you are considering two choices for transporta -
tion: airplane or cruise ship. If you travel by airplane, you deduct what 
you spend. If you travel by cruise ship, you may not deduct more than 
the luxury water-travel limits that apply for each day of your travel to St. 
Thomas.
In 2017, the luxury water-travel daily limit varies from a low of $688 to a 
high of $872.18 
You can find the current per diem rates at www .gsa.gov/perdiem. For 
those who enjoy business travel aboard a cruise ship, find your daily 
luxury water-travel limit by doubling the highest rate of per diem in this 
publication for your days of travel. 
In 2017, the highest daily per diem limit is $436 in Telluride, Colorado.  
Two times the $436 produces a 2017 luxury water-travel limit of $872 a 
day for travel from January through March 2017.

 17NotesThe following daily luxury water-travel limits apply in 2017. The IRS may 
adjust the rates for the last three months in its October 2017 revision of the 
per diem rates (see IRS publication 1542—this is simply a republication of 
the GSA rates cited earlier). If the rates change, an IRS transition rule al -
lows you to choose the rates below or the updated rates. The current rates 
for 2017 are: 
l $872 from 1/1 to 3/31 and 12/1 to 12/3119
l $760 from 4/1 to 4/3020
l $688 from 5/1 to 5/3121
l $736 from 6/1 to 8/3122
l $750 from 9/1 to 11/3023
Let's go back to your trip to St. Thomas. Say you're going to cruise to a 
seminar, attend the seminar, and cruise back. Let's assume that your cruise 
will take place in December and will take seven days. Your maximum 
write-off for your cruise ship business travel to and from the seminar is 
$6,104 per business traveler ($872 x 7 days). 
Deduct Your Transportation Cost by Using the 
Trip-Day Rules
Rule:  You deduct business transportation expenses to the extent that your 
trip passes a test for deducting transportation. See the flowchart at the left 
for an easy overview .
Work days exceed personal days:  The work-days-exceed-personal-days 
(primary purpose) test applies to the costs of transporting yourself to and 
from a business destination within the 50 United States or the District of 
Columbia. Under this test, if you spend more days on business than you 
spend on pleasure, you deduct 100 percent of your transportation.24 If 
your trip is not primarily business, you may deduct nothing for transporta -
tion.
Foreign-travel test:  If more than 75 percent of your days are business 
days, you may deduct 100 percent of the costs of transporting yourself to 
a foreign destination. A foreign destination is outside the 50 United States 
and District of Columbia.25 If you spend 75 percent or less of your days 
on business, you may deduct transportation expenses based on the ratio of 
business days to total trip days.26
Trip outside the U.S. for seven days or less:  You may deduct 100 percent 
of the transportation to a foreign destination when your trip involves one 
business day and is less than seven days, excluding the day of departure.27Think of the primary pur-
pose test as the 51/49 test 
with 51 as the business part! 
18NotesReasons for Business Travel
Travel to start a new business:  See the discussion in the start-up section 
of this program.
Travel for your hobby:  Should you travel for your hobby, your expenses, 
including travel, may not exceed your income from the hobby.28 Worse, 
you may not deduct any hobby losses—not in the current year or against 
income of a future year.29
Example:  You raise dairy cows for a hobby. Your gross income from sales 
is $1,000. You spend $500 in interest to finance the cows and $900 to feed 
them. Your $400 loss is not deductible this year30 or in any future year.31
Licenses in more than one state:  See the discussion in Section 4 on how 
to treat two places of business. 
Get educated out of town:  You may deduct the travel costs necessary to 
obtain education or attend a meeting or convention.32 Tax law does not 
require study in your backyard, even when the same courses are available 
there. The Senate noted that a French scholar may deduct his travel to 
study at the Sorbonne.33 Similarly, a Texas professor deducted the costs of 
travel and living in Hawaii while studying for her Ph.D. in Hawaii.34
Meet with colleagues:  You could travel to meet with colleagues in other 
parts of the country to learn new skills. 
Job hunting trips:  You want business deductions. Job hunting produces 
personal deductions, but when you are desparate, this beats nothing.
Deducting the cost of bringing your spouse to the convention:  Tax law 
gives no deduction for travel of a spouse, dependent, or other individual 
accompanying the taxpayer on business travel unless:35
l The spouse, dependent, or other companion is an employee of the 
taxpayer
l The travel of the spouse, dependent, or other companion is for a bona 
fide business purpose
l Travel expenses of the spouse, dependent, or other person would oth -
erwise be deductible
The law makes it clear that your spouse not only must be an employee, but 
also must travel for a bona fide business purpose. You get no travel deduc -
tion when you bring your spouse to:
l Be the socially gracious spouse36
l Staff the hospitality suite37
l Be the assigned fraternizer38
l Type notes, eat lunches and dinners39
 19NotesThe presence of your children at the travel site helps negate the business 
aspects of your spouse's travel.40
Videotapes at resorts:  You get no deduction for a business seminar that 
gives you a videotaped lecture that you may watch at your convenience.41 
If you must watch the tape at the seminar or convention site, the videotape 
counts just as if you attended a live lecture.42
Observation:  You obviously invite more scrutiny if you attend a resort-
based session that consists solely or primarily of videotape. 
Convention delegate:  You may deduct the costs of attending a conven -
tion as a delegate if you can show that attendance advanced your personal 
business interests.43 
Example:  You attend the Toastmasters International convention as a 
delegate. You can prove that such attendance generated more revenue than 
you spent at the convention. You may deduct the costs.
Special Rules for Conventions
U.S. cruise ship conventions:  You may deduct up to $2,000 for the cost of 
a cruise ship convention or meeting, provided:
l The meeting relates directly to the active conduct of your business.44
l The ship is a registered U.S. vessel.45
l All ports of call are in the United States or its possessions.46
l You attach written statements, signed by you and the program spon -
sor, to your tax return.47
North American conventions: You may not deduct a foreign convention 
unless it is as reasonable for the convention to be outside the United States 
as to be within the United States. "Reasonable" is the basic rule. Of course, 
the law contains exceptions! Convention trips to defined North American 
destinations do not have to pass the foreign trip reasonableness test.48 The 
defined North American area includes:49
l American Samoa
l Antigua
l Aruba
l Bahamas
l Baker Island
l Barbados 
l Barbuda
l Bermuda 
l Canada
l Costa Rica
20Notesl Curacao
l Dominica
l Dominican Republic
l Grenada 
l Guam
l Guyana
l Honduras
l Howland Island
l Jamaica
l Jarvis Island
l Johnston Island
l Kingman Reef
l Marshall Islands
l Mexico
l Micronesia
l Midway Islands
l Northern Mariana Islands
l Palau
l Palmyra Atoll
l Panama
l Puerto Rico
l Saint Lucia
l Trinidad and Tobago
l U.S. Virgin Islands
l U.S.A (includes the 50 States, District of Columbia, and other U.S. 
islands, cays. and reefs)
l Wake Island
To deduct a convention trip to the above destinations, you must make the 
trip during the ordinary and necessary course of your business. For exam -
ple, you must have a business reason to attend the convention. 
Foreign conventions:  Tax law states:50 "In the case of any individual who 
attends a convention, seminar, or similar meeting which is held outside the 
North American area, no deduction shall be allowed under Section 162 
for expenses allocable to such meeting unless the taxpayer establishes that 
the meeting is directly related to the active conduct of his trade or business 
and that, after taking into account in the manner provided by regulations 
prescribed by the secretary:
1. the purpose of such meeting and the activities taking place at such 
meeting,
2. the purposes and activities of the sponsoring organization or groups,
3. the residences of the active members of the sponsoring organization 
and the places at which other meetings of the sponsoring organization Tax law treats travel to any North 
America location listed to the left 
under the same rules it applies to 
travel to Chicago (or any other U.S. 
destination).
Travel outside the North 
American area for sales 
dollars.
 21Notesor groups have been held or will be held, and
4. such other relevant facts as the taxpayer may present,
it is as reasonable for the meeting to be held outside the North American 
area as within the North American area."
Technical note:  The Senate committee report from which the foreign 
convention rules originate states: "The bill makes clear that the foreign 
convention provisions do not apply to normal business meetings for em -
ployees of a company."51
Applying the Rules to Some Example Trips
Example 1:  You travel from Seattle to Miami Thursday, work Friday, 
stand by Saturday and Sunday, work Monday, and return home Tuesday. 
The six days qualify as business days. You deduct 100 percent of your 
transportation to and from Miami. You also deduct your costs of sustain -
ing life for each of the six business days. 
 
Example 2: Same as Example 1, except you vacation for four days at the 
end of your stay. Again, you deduct 100 percent of your transportation. 
You also deduct the same costs for the six business days. You do not de -
duct any costs for the four vacation days. 
Example 3:  You travel from Miami to Seattle Wednesday, work Thursday, 
layover Friday and Saturday to save travel costs with a lower airfare, and 
return home Sunday. You deduct 100 percent of your transportation. You 
also deduct your costs of sustaining life for each of the five days.
 
Example 4:  You travel from San Diego to Philadelphia and spend 3 days 
working and 15 days playing. You deduct your costs of sustaining life for 
the three work days and nothing (zero, zip) for transportation.
Building Audit-Proof Support for Your Travel 
Deductions 
Timely records required: Tax law effectively requires you to record travel 
expenditures "at or near the time" you incur the expenses.52 Timely records 
have a "high degree of credibility not present with respect to a statement 
prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of accurate 
recall."53
Diary entries needed:  Generally, when taxpayers lose court cases involv -
ing travel, they lack proper documentation, mainly entries in a diary.54In other words, taxpayers not 
in control of meeting locations 
may deduct the costs of such 
meetings under the "not in my 
control" standard. (Document 
your work effort to ensure 
deductions.)

 23NotesWhat to write down:  You must prove for each travel expenditure:55
1. Amount: Amount of each separate expenditure for traveling away 
from home, such as cost of transportation or lodging, except that daily 
cost of a traveler's own breakfast, lunch, dinner, and incidentals may 
be aggregated, if set forth in reasonable categories, such as meals, gas 
and oil, and taxi.
2. Time: Dates of departure and return for each trip away from home, 
and number of days away from home spent on business.
3. Place: Destination or locality of travel, described by name of city or 
town or other similar designation.
4. Business purpose: Business reason for travel or nature of the business 
benefit derived or expected.
See the entry on the left for an easy way to meet the requirements. Note 
the answers to the questions: Where (city)? Why (business reason)?
Receipts required:  Tax law requires documentary evidence, such as 
receipts, paid bills, or similar evidence sufficient to support expenditures 
for:56
l Lodging
l Any expenditure of $75 or more
Hint:  Keep receipts for all expenses and record the places where you eat 
the meals, e.g., hotel, McDonald's, etc.
Categories of travel:  The IRS lists the following recognized categories of 
travel expenses:
l Meals and lodging, both en route and at the final work destination;57
l Transportation costs, including air, rail or bus fares, and the costs of 
transporting baggage, sample cases, or display materials;58
l The allocable portion of operating and maintenance expenses of auto -
mobiles, house trailers, and airplanes;59
l Cleaning and laundry;60
l Telephone;61
l Public stenographer costs;62
 l Costs of transportation between an airport or station and hotel, from 
customer to customer, and from one place of business to another;63 
and
l Tips incidental to the above expenses.64
Cleaning and laundry: To deduct the cost of cleaning your clothes, you 
must get the clothes dirty while in travel status (out of town overnight).65 
The rules do not require that you get your travel clothes cleaned while out 
of town.

 25Notes Section 3
Paying Mom and Dad or Friends 
or Relatives for Business 
Lodging at Their Homes
You travel on business to the city where your mother and father live. Can 
you stay with mom and dad and then count that day as a deductible busi -
ness travel day even if you do not have a lodging receipt? Can you take 
your mom and dad to dinner and deduct the dinner as a cost of lodging? 
Can you pay your mom and dad for your night’s lodging and deduct that 
payment? This section shows you the best financial result for both you and 
your mom and dad. 
If you stay with mom and dad and do not pay them for the stay, you still 
have a deductible travel day for your other expenses. Further, you do not 
need to jump through any special hoops to support your trip. You will 
probably already have a plane ticket, fees paid for seminars and meetings, 
rental car, etc., that help support your stay in town. 
Should you stay at mom’s and dad’s for free and then take them to dinner 
as a repayment for free lodging, you obviously have a business reason for 
the entertainment. Should the dinner cost less than the value of the lodg -
ing, the dinner should be deductible as business entertainment. 
The best strategy is the rental strategy. Tax law ignores the rental of a prin -
cipal home when the rental days during a tax year total less than 15 days.1 
Thus, your mom and dad could collect up to 14 days of rental income and 
report zero rental income subject to income tax. Is this good, or is this 
good!
Make sure you pay a “fair rent” to your mom and dad for the period of 
your stay. Without a fair rent, the IRS could disallow the transaction as a 
sham. 
Perhaps there are some hotels and motels near your parents’ home. You 
might collect hotel rate sheets and make copies for your mom and dad 
(think evidence here). The rates should be for accommodations similar to 
those you experience when staying with your mom and dad. Photos of 
mom’s and dad’s guest room and maybe a brochure with pictures from the 
hotel can make great evidence in your tax file.
26NotesWith respect to your trip, you may deduct your cost of lodging when you 
have a business day.2 Business days include not only days when you attend 
seminars, but also those days between meetings when it is more cost-effec -
tive to stay where you are than to return home. 
Regardless of where you stay on a trip, tax law requires receipts for all lodg -
ing deductions, no matter the cost.3 If you pay mom and dad, you need to ob -
tain a receipt. This does not need to be formal: a simple handwritten receipt 
can do just fine. 
Say that during the year you stay at your mom’s and dad’s home for 11 nights 
while visiting town on business. Based on evidence, you can prove that mom’s 
and dad’s guest room is about equal to the motel down the street that rents for 
$119 a night.  If you pay mom and dad $119 a night for 11 nights, you may 
deduct the $1,309 you paid for lodging. 
Your mom and dad collect the $1,309 as tax-free income because they rented 
their  home for less than 15 days during the tax year. The rules state that they 
do not have to report the $1,309 in rent receipts to the IRS. 
However, there is some required paperwork. Even though mom and dad do 
not pay taxes on this rental income, they will list the rent from the IRS Form 
1099 on their tax return. In this case, you have to give your mom and dad an 
IRS Form 1099 for the rents.4 Tax law says that when you pay business rents 
of $600 or more to an individual during a tax year, you must report the total 
of those business rents to the IRS.5
If your parents get an IRS Form 1099 for rental income, you know that the 
IRS expects to find that number in their tax return. Do not let your parents 
disappoint the IRS! Mom and dad should report the rental income from the 
Form 1099 on their Schedule E for the year. Then, because the amount is not 
taxable, they should subtract that amount in the expense section of Schedule 
E and add a supporting statement that states: “Taxpayers rented their per -
sonal residence for less than 15 days during the tax year. Such rent is exempt 
from tax under IRC Section 280A.”

How to Treat Two Regular Places 
of Business
Florida in the Winter and Wisconsin in the 
Summer
If you have two or more regular places of business, your tax home is at 
your principal place of business.1 You may deduct expenses traveling to 
discharge duties at your non-principal place of business.2
Example:  Your tax home is in Wisconsin. You may deduct as a business 
expense your three-month stay to work at your secondary location in 
Florida.
The location of your principal place of business is a question of fact; im -
portant factors include:3 
l Total time ordinarily spent at each business post
l Degree of business activity at each post
l Financial return attributable to each post 
Example:  Your nine-month stay in Wisconsin generates 70 percent of 
your gross income and 72 percent of your total financial return from all 
endeavors. Your tax home is in Wisconsin.
When you travel away from home overnight on business, you need to keep 
a good diary book. Records you keep must prove amounts, time, place, 
and business purposes for travel expenditures.4 
You do not need receipts for travel expenses less than $75, provided such 
expenses are not for lodging.5 
Our new, friendly IRS says that a log maintained weekly, which accounts 
for use during the week, is a record made at or near the time of such use.6 
By keeping the weekly record, you meet the IRS test for maintaining a di -
ary, travel log, trip sheet, or similar documentation while you have current 
knowledge of your travel expenditures.7
You have to love this simple set of rules for running businesses in more 
than one location. As they say, location is everything.

 29Notes Section 5
Entertainment Not Subject to the 
50 Percent Cut
Special Sporting Events
Special “sporting event” tax rules: If it qualifies as deductible entertain -
ment, you may deduct 100 percent of the cost of tickets to a sporting event 
that benefits a charity, if the event:1
Is organized for the primary purpose of benefiting the charity l
Gives the entire net proceeds to the charity l
Uses volunteers to perform substantially all of the event’s work l
Deduct the works:  The deduction includes the cost of the ticket package, includ -
ing amounts spent for:2
l Seating
l Use of entertainment areas
l Contestant positions
l Meals furnished at or as part of the event
l Parking
Golf tournament example:  You buy four tickets to the Booz Allen Classic golf 
tournament in Washington, D.C. You use the tickets to take three clients and 
yourself. You discuss business during lunch. That discussion qualifies the enter -
tainment as a deduction under the “associated entertainment” rules. You may 
deduct 100 percent because:
l The tournament donates its net proceeds to charity. 
l The tournament uses 1,200 volunteers and only 5 paid employees (volun -
teers do substantially all the work). 
l The tournament is organized by the PGA tour for the primary purpose of 
benefiting 501(c)(3) charities.
Charity golf outing example:  You play in a golf event where the net proceeds 
of the tournament go to your church. You buy two $150 tickets, one for you and 
one for your business prospect. The church sends you a notice that, of the $150, 
$110 goes for greens fees, carts, prizes, etc., and your deduction is only $40. How 
much can you deduct for the two tickets?
Result 1:  If you do not have a business discussion with your business prospect 
over breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you deduct $80 as a charitable contribution.
Result 2:  If you have a substantial and bona fide business discussion and the 
golf qualifies as associated entertainment, you deduct $300—the full ticket price. 
Also, this golf event qualifies for an exemption from the percentage reduction in 
entertainment expenses (currently 50 percent). 
30NotesPlanning note:  Charity golf for business produces double the deductions of regu -
lar business golf (100 percent versus 50 percent).3 Also, the full deduction applies 
to the full ticket package, including related services such as parking, use of enter -
tainment areas, contestant positions, and meals furnished as part of the event.4
Planning tip:  Make sure you identify the $300 deduction to your accountant as 
not subject to the 50 percent rule. Otherwise, your accountant will put the $300 in 
the spot where he or she automatically cuts it with the 50 percent rule. 
Party With Your Employees for 100 Percent
Employee recreation produces 100 percent deductions not subject to the 50 
percent rule on entertainment:  Tax law does not apply the 50 percent en -
tertainment rule to recreational expenses for employees.5 In most cases, your 
deductible entertainment is cut by 50 percent when you file your tax return. 
The 50 percent rule does not apply to recreational expenses for employees. 
Cruises for employees:  American Business Service Corporation, a Southern 
California temporary employment agency, has about 100 employees. On 41 
occasions during the year, the  corporation charters a 53-foot powerboat for 
one-day recreational cruises for its employees. 
The boat can safely and comfortably accommodate about 30 people. Employ -
ees, owners, and executives who want to play on the boat for a day have to 
sign up in advance. This is a “first-come, first-served” event. 
The  corporation has one central office and about 25 branch offices, located 
primarily in central and southern California. The  corporation’s “ordinary 
and necessary” business purpose for the cruises is to bring together and create 
social interaction among its
l branch employees,
l central office employees,
l managers, and
l executive employees.
During a recent year, the  corporation paid $41,000 for 41 excursions. The 
court ruled that the  corporation could deduct all of the $41,000, without 
worrying about the 50 percent cut for entertainment, because the cruises6 
l were primarily for the employees,
l did not discriminate in favor of the owners and highly compensated em -
ployees,
l were documented as to who cruised and when,
l passed the ordinary and necessary business purpose test, 
l were exempt from the 50 percent cut in entertainment rule, and
l were exempt from the directly related entertainment rule. 
 31NotesPrimarily for employees:  To qualify for the 100 percent deduction, the recre -
ation, the recreational event or facility must primarily benefit your employees, 
other than those who
l own 10 percent or more of the business, or
l are in the highly compensated group. 
10 percent test:  For purposes of the 10 percent test, an employee is treated as 
owning any interest owned by a member of his or her family. The family in -
cludes brothers and sisters, spouse, ancestors (like parents and grandparents), 
and lineal descendants (like children and grandchildren).7
Technical note:  American Business Service Corporation won its deductions 
for the cruises because it could prove that it conducted the cruises primarily 
for the benefit of its employees and that it did not discriminate in favor of 10 
percent owners or highly compensated employees.
Highly compensated employees are those employees who during the current 
or preceding year8
l own 5 percent or more of the business,
l receive pay greater than $120,000 and rank by pay in the top 20 percent 
of all paid employees, or
l are officers of the corporation.
Primary:  In tax law, the term “primary” or “primarily” means “more than 50 
percent.”9 For employee recreation, that means the rank-and-file employees 
have to use the facility more than 50 percent of the time. You could measure 
this by days of use, time of use, or any other reasonable method.
How McReavy got a zero deduction:  In McReavy,10 a corporation owned by 
William and Kathleen McReavy owned a one-bedroom lake cabin on a four-
acre island in Minnesota. The McReavys often had deductible business par -
ties for their friends at this cabin. They also, supposedly, made this lake cabin 
available to their employees and claimed that the cabin was a recreational 
facility primarily for the benefit of the employees. However, the employees 
seldom used this cabin and that limited use caused loss of the recreational 
facility deductions. 
Those McReavy employees who did use the island cabin had to agree that 
they would help maintain it. During the summer months, some employees 
visited the property every other week to perform maintenance, mow the grass, 
and water the flowers. On two or three occasions over a two-year period, the 
McReavys invited employees to the cabin for a steak fry.
The court noted that, other than those occasional steak fries and whatever 
minor recreational use might have been enjoyed while carrying out mainte -
nance assignments, the McReavy employees did not use the property for rec -
reational purposes during the years at issue. Therefore, the court denied the 
32NotesMcReavy deduction for its employee recreational facility because the cabin 
was used primarily by the owners of the corporation.
Court’s rationale:  The court noted that “actual use of the facility” controls 
this deduction, not availability of the cabin for employee use.
What do you do?  What things do you do, or could you do, primarily for the 
benefit of your employees? Remember, primary means more than 50 percent. 
Say you have a beach home. Say that, during the year, your employees use the 
beach home on more days than you use the beach home. Presto, with an ordi -
nary business-use reason, you have a beach-home deduction on your Sched -
ule C. That’s the beauty of the 50 percent test—you can measure it directly.
The law contemplates that your recreational activities for your employees will 
include things like Christmas parties, annual picnics, summer outings, and 
facilities for the employees like swimming pools, baseball diamonds, bowling 
alleys, and golf courses.
Your ordinary and necessary business reason:  You must have an ordinary 
and necessary business reason for your partying with the employees. The 
phrase “ordinary and necessary” has a specialized definition in tax law, and 
one that you will like. Here is what the court said about the terms “ordinary 
and necessary” in the Capital Video case.11 
The term “necessary” imposes “only the minimal requirement that the expense be "ap -
propriate and helpful” for “the development of  the [taxpayer’s] business.” An expense 
need not be recurring in order to be considered ordinary.
There are many cases that use similar definitions, but the bottom line is that 
“ordinary and necessary” is easy. Even though it’s easy, it requires action. 
Think about your ordinary and necessary reason and document it.
Your reason might be as simple as improving employee morale and binding 
employees to your business because you offer more fun and better working 
conditions than the competition. Obviously, that’s what the law had in mind 
when it named the summer picnic as a deductible employee party.
The Making-Presentations Exception Grants   
100-Percent Deductions for Entertainment 
Example 1:  In Matlock, the court ruled that Matlock could deduct 100 
percent of the refreshments he served to prospects during sales seminars 
he conducted in his home.12 The court concluded that the refreshments 
were a cost of his sales seminar and not entertainment. Matlock sold solar 
heating and cooling systems. He installed a unit in his home. He used the 
sales seminars in his home to show the system. Because the meals were 
integral to the sales presentation, the court ruled that Matlock could avoid 
the 50 percent reduction. Thus, Matlock deducted 100 percent of the meal 
costs as business promotional expenses.
 33NotesExample 2:  IRS regulations state that the cost of a fashion show is not en -
tertainment when put on by a manufacturer of dresses for its prospective 
store buyers.13 On the other hand, the IRS notes that the appliance dis -
tributor who conducts a fashion show for the wives of his retailers incurs 
entertainment expenses.14
Example 3:  The IRS says that although attending a theatrical performance 
is generally entertainment, this is not true for a professional theater critic 
who attends in his or her professional capacity.15
Example 4:  In a private ruling, the IRS concluded that the taxpayer who 
provided free dinners to his prospects before his sales presentations in -
curred 100 percent deductible costs, not costs subject to the 50 percent 
limit.16 In this ruling, the taxpayer earned commissions on his sales of 
real property. He invited prospects to a free dinner, after which he made 
his sales presentations. The IRS concluded that the meals were associated 
with the taxpayer’s business, but not subject to the ceiling on entertain -
ment deductions.
Example 5:  In its explanation of the entertainment rules, the Senate noted 
that the cost of food served by a wine merchant to show how wines are 
suitable for particular meals does not incur entertainment expenses but 
regular promotional expenses.17
Do I Have to Invite the General Public?
In Matlock, the court ruled that Robert Matlock incurred presentation expens -
es and not entertainment expenses at the solar heating and cooling seminars 
he conducted in his home.18 At these presentations, Matlock had food and 
beverages. He found his customers in various ways, including telemarketing. 
We assume that he sold to anyone he could find (i.e., the public).
In Matlock, the court stated that its task was to decide whether the solar en -
ergy sales talks at Matlock’s home were entertainment. The court concluded 
that the talks were not entertainment but presentations. The court said Mat -
lock’s talks were like the IRS regulation example in which the manufacturer 
of dresses does not entertain when he conducts fashion shows to introduce his 
products to groups of store buyers.
In Private Letter Ruling 9414040, a real estate broker provided free meals to 
prospects who attended his sales presentations. The attendees entered draw -
ings at trade shows, conventions, and the state fair. The broker then used 
telemarketing to invite the prospects to the free dinners. The IRS ruled that the 
dinners were not entertainment subject to the limit but rather were 100 percent 
deductible (like Matlock’s presentation expenses).
34NotesIn this ruling, the IRS cited the example in which a wine merchant has a wine 
tasting that includes both the wines and the foods that show the suitability of 
each wine for particular meals.
In both Matlock and the IRS ruling, the taxpayers were marketing to the general 
public. So first you will have to say that you make your presentations to the gen -
eral public. If your audience is made up of relatives and close friends, they are 
not the public; but if your audience is made up of prospects and customers with 
whom you have no personal relationship, they are obviously the public.
Cruise Ship Entertainment
If the cruise line breaks out the cost of meals and entertainment from the 
other costs of the cruise, you have to apply the 50 percent cut to those 
meals before you apply the daily limits to the trip.19 That’s the bad news.
 
The good news is that if the cruise ship fare does not break out the costs 
of meals and entertainment, you deduct 100 percent of your cruise ship 
fare up to the amount of the daily limits.
 
Line of attack.  Cruise only on cruise ships that do not break out the costs 
of meals and entertainment.

Strategies to Capture More 
Entertainment Deductions
Deduct “Dutch Treat” Business Entertainment
General Dutch treat rule:  IRS regulations state that the taxpayer may 
deduct entertainment “even though the expenditure relates to the taxpayer 
alone.”1 The IRS says its objective test precludes arguments that “enter -
tainment” means only entertainment of others.2 Further, the IRS acknowl -
edges that business entertainment may include an activity that satisfies a 
personal, family, or living expense.3 The IRS notes that an individual in 
business may deduct the entertainment cost, including his personal ben -
efit, as a business expense.4
Example:  Wilson and Jones go to lunch to discuss prospecting methods. 
The lunch costs $32. Wilson pays his $16 share. Jones pay his $16 share. 
Both Wilson and Jones may deduct their $16 shares. 
Urbauer case:  Charles Urbauer used both the “directly related” and the 
“associated” entertainment rules to further his business, play golf, and 
bowl. Urbauer, an eight-handicap golfer, waited on the first tee for pros -
pects to arrive, played golf with them, and then discussed business over 
drinks and dinner. He achieved deductions for both the golf and the 
dinners.5 The dinners met the “directly related” test because he actively 
pursued future benefit over dinner. His golf occurred on the same day. He 
did not pay either for the others to play golf or for their dinners. The court 
also allowed Urbauer to deduct his bowling league fees. 
O’Donoghue case:  Laurie O’Donoghue sold commodities. After work, 
she and her colleagues stopped by the local pub to down a few drinks and 
talk about the market. Sometimes they had dinner later. O’Donoghue 
claimed $6,500 for expenses, including taxi fares. O’Donoghue made a 
tragic mistake in recording her business entertainment: she did not always 
write down the business reason for the entertainment (remember—note 
“future business”). The court allowed her Dutch treat drinks and meals to 
the extent she met the five elements of support.6
36NotesFrequent Lunches with Office Manager
Can you take your office manager to lunch four times a week and 
deduct them?
No, you violate the “too many lunches” rule. In your case, you are 
absorbing too much of your personal, family, and living expenses by 
having too many of these lunches.
You are like Richard Hankenson, MD, who had 174 lunches with 
his staff and other doctors. The court ruled that the lunches were 
personal.7
The IRS may invoke the Sutter Rule (named after this taxpayer) if it 
believes you are having too many business meals that absorb your oth -
erwise personal living expenses.8 
As a rule of thumb, limit your entertainment for a single person to 30 
times or less during a year. Call this the tax-strategies-gut-check rule for 
entertainment with the same person. Also, you’ll want to follow our 
other gut-check rule of no more than 100 deductible breakfasts, 100 
deductible lunches, and 100 deductible dinners per year.
Deduct the Cost of Entertaining Closely 
Connected Spouses and Family Members
Deductions for spouses:  If you bring your spouse to the entertain -
ment and you meet the rules for deducting the entertainment with a 
business discussion, you may deduct your cost and the cost for your 
spouse.9 The rules clearly state that entertainment associated with the 
taxpayer’s active conduct of business may include deductions for those 
“closely connected” with the taxpayer.10 The IRS says your spouse 
is closely connected!11 Thus, should you and your spouse entertain 
another couple and should you meet the rules for business discussion, 
you may deduct the costs of entertaining the spouses.12
Closely connected rule restated:  If entertainment of a business guest 
qualifies as “directly related entertainment,” the “closely connected” 
rule allows you to deduct the costs of entertaining the spouses.13
Other closely connected persons:  The IRS states that the same rule 
applies to all who are closely connected, but it fails to specify other 
possibilities, such as children, Mom and Dad, and significant others.14 
The IRS does include “family” in its definition of entertainment, and 
thus it seems reasonable to consider children and other family mem -
bers as closely connected under the proper circumstances.15
 37NotesDo Not Entertain for Goodwill Reasons
Goodwill entertainment not deductible:  Auto Zapper & Towing, Inc., 
repossessed autos, boats, and motor homes. Auto Zapper got its business 
from various financial institutions. To promote its business, Zapper char -
tered three buses to transport its employees and their prospects from Los 
Angeles to Las Vegas for a weekend of gambling. Zapper provided refresh -
ments during the five-hour trip and paid the hotel bills for all participants. 
The trip had a significant upward impact on Zapper’s business. One bank 
supervisor testified that his employees liked the trip enough to want to 
give Zapper the bulk of the bank’s repossession activity. During the trip, 
the buses stopped twice so that Zapper employees could switch buses and 
mingle more.
Zapper claimed $9,300 as its deduction for the trip. The court ruled that 
the expenses passed Test One because they were ordinary and necessary. 
But then the court ruled that the expenses failed Test Two because there 
were no “directly related” business discussions. The employees did not 
write down what they discussed with whom during the trip. The court 
ruled that the $9,300 was nondeductible “goodwill” entertaining because 
there was no business discussion before or after the goodwill entertain -
ment.16
Planning tip:  Make your goodwill entertainment “associated entertain -
ment” with meetings or discussions that precede or follow the entertain -
ment. 
Deduct Season Ticket Cost Based on Ticket Use
Season ticket rule:  When you hold season or series tickets to events, like 
the home games of the baseball team, you treat each ticket as a separate 
item, and deduct the tickets based on how you used the tickets.17
Example:  You buy four season tickets to the eight scheduled games (32 
tickets). You and your spouse take the Nelsons to the first game after a 
business discussion at dinner. The cost of the four tickets is deductible as 
entertainment associated with the directly related business dinner.
Give Gifts of Entertainment to Avoid $25 Cap on 
Gifts
Gift versus entertainment rule:  For business gifts, you may deduct up to 
$25 a person a year.18 For entertainment, you may deduct whatever the 
38Notesentertainment rules allow, like 50 percent of the amount spent for a busi -
ness meal.19 If you give your ticket to a prospect and do not accompany 
the recipient to the entertainment, you may treat the cost of an admission 
ticket as either a gift or an entertainment expense.20
Example:  You give season tickets to the ballet to a new client. You may 
deduct the $275 cost of the tickets as entertainment.
Rebates:  See the section on rebates for a complete discussion of this topic.
Deduct the Cost of Entertaining Prospects and 
Clients in Your Home
Home entertainment rule:  The law contains no special rules for home 
entertainment. You may deduct directly related home entertainment. You 
may deduct associated home entertainment. In other words, the business 
discussion must take place either in your home or within 24 hours of the 
home entertainment.
Example:  You invite Mr. and Mrs. Johnson to dinner to ask them for 
referrals. Your grocery and beverage bills total $120. You may deduct the 
$120 cost for entertaining Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, your spouse, and your -
self. 
Receipts required:  You need receipts to support home entertainment 
expenses of $75 or more. You could make separate purchases of your 
business groceries. You also could circle the business items on a combined 
business and personal grocery receipt. 
Deduct the Cost of Small Dinner Parties in Your 
Home
Dinner party rules:  The IRS presumes a social gathering with little or no 
possibility of business discussion when you have a large group gathered 
in your home.21 You can use directly related business discussions to over -
come the no-business presumption.22
Example:  You invite seven couples to your home for dinner. You have di -
rectly related business discussions with five couples. Include yourself, and 
then deduct 6/8 of the cost.
 39NotesDeduct the Cost of Large Parties
Planning tip:  See the section in this book on presentation expenses on 
how to make large meetings 100 percent deductible and not subject to the 
50 percent cut that applies to entertainment. 
The IRS notes that you do not meet the “directly related” test in settings 
where it is impossible to have meaningful business discussions.23 This 
clearly applies where the distractions are substantial, such as when the 
meetings or discussions occur at nightclubs, theaters, sporting events, cock -
tail parties, or social gatherings.
The IRS cites Israelson24 as an example of how to disallow a deduction. 
Israelson, a lawyer, gave a party at the country club. He invited clients, 
referral sources, colleagues, and other business associates. He discussed no 
business at the party. The court ruled that Israelson gets no deduction for 
the party.
Big NO-NO: You may not deduct the cost of a party to build goodwill.25
Rule:  You may deduct the cost of a large party when:
l The cost is not lavish or extravagant.26
l You meet the “directly related” or “associated” standard for business 
guests.27
l You have the party for employees.28 (Note—employee parties are 100 
percent deductible.)
l There is a proper allocation of costs to business and personal guests.29
l There are receipts, invoices, canceled checks, and charge-card slips to 
support monies spent.30
Big hurdle:  Your primary motivation for the party must be future busi -
ness.31 You automatically get credit for future business motivation for the 
employees you invite to the party.32
Solution:  Make your home a clear business setting for the Christmas 
party. You do this when you:33
l Let attendees know that you are directly furthering your business
l Display your products
l Discuss your products
l Have as your clear purpose business publicity rather than goodwill
Example:  You sell insurance for a living. On a bulletin board near the 
bar, you post product broadsides and other descriptions of IRAs, private 
pensions, insurance, etc. You discuss the products with anyone who has 
questions. The bulletin board display establishes a clear business setting 
and sets the stage for making a large party deductible.
40NotesBuilding proof:  You help prove active business pursuit when your invita -
tion contains your business name and states something like: “Please come 
for holiday cheer and help me celebrate 15 years in the insurance busi -
ness.” Take photos of attendees viewing that bulletin board covered with 
your product brochures. Take candid shots of attendees viewing other 
product literature. Process your film or digital images at a store where they 
stamp the date processed on the side or back of the photo. Next, jot down 
in your diary as many business conversations as you can remember from 
the party. Finally, keep receipts for the costs of the party. If you bought 
both business and personal groceries, circle the business items on the re -
ceipt and keep it.
Like You, Tiger Woods May Not Deduct His Golf-
Club and Similar Dues
In Garcia ,34 the court stated, “No one, including golf professionals or in -
structors, may deduct club dues” (dues paid to a private country club). In 
other words, not even Tiger Woods may deduct his country club dues.
In tax law, we call this “overkill”. In 1993, when lawmakers were attempt -
ing to balance the budget by finding more tax money, they decided that 
they could get some easy cash by eliminating the club dues deduction. 
Rather than allow any bona fide business use of clubs or consider any type 
of fairness or equity, lawmakers instead opted for what they called “strict 
nondeductibility,” regardless of circumstances.35
Therefore, the law says that dues paid to a private country club are not 
deductible, period. No business reason overcomes this no-deduction-un -
der-any-circumstances rule.
Planning note:  The no-deduction-under-any-circumstances rule applies 
to membership in any club organized for pleasure, recreation, or other 
social purpose. The purposes and activities of a club, and not its name, 
determine whether it is organized for pleasure, recreation, or other social 
purpose. Clubs organized for pleasure, recreation, or other social purposes 
include, but are not limited to,36 
l country clubs, 
l golf and athletic clubs, 
l airline clubs, 
l hotel clubs, and 
l luncheon and dinner clubs.
Exceptions:  In general, the law does not consider the following clubs as 
organized for pleasure, recreation, or other social purposes:37
 41Notesl business leagues, 
l trade associations, 
l chambers of commerce, 
l boards of trade, 
l real estate boards, 
l professional organizations (such as bar associations and medical as -
sociations), and 
l civic or public service organizations.
Are Dues to the Shriners or Masons Deductible? 
Good question! Neither the law nor the regulations provide a definitive 
answer. In its preamble to the regulations, the IRS states that the rules 
that disallow deductions for club dues do not apply to the Kiwanis, Lions, 
Rotary, or Civitan.38 The preamble goes on to state the general rule that 
you may not deduct club dues paid to any membership organization, a 
principal purpose of which is to conduct entertainment activities for its 
members.39
Thus, are the Shriners and Masons like the Kiwanis, Lions, Rotary, or 
Civitan? If you can say “yes” to this question, you probably qualify for a 
deduction. Next, do the Shriners or Masons have a purpose of entertain -
ment that is greater than the Kiwanis, Lions, Rotary, or Civitan? If no, 
then you probably qualify for a deduction.
Your Shriners or Masons club dues are one of those deductions where you 
have to use judgment until you can find precedent.
Deduct Expenses to Entertain Clients on Boats
General rule:  When you entertain on your boat, you may deduct only the 
out-of-pocket expenses.40 Examples include the money you spend for:
l Gas and oil
l Food and beverages
You may not deduct any slip rental fees, maintenance, or depreciation on 
the boat.41 Tax law treats the boat as an “entertainment facility” and disal -
lows all boat expenses.42
Planning tip : Use the boat (like a car) primarily for transportation and 
you do not trigger the entertainment-facility rules on the transportation 
part. See the entertainment-facility section for more rules on how to make 
entertainment facilities deductible.

Beware of the Entertainment 
Facility Rules That Kill Tax 
Deductions
Ugly words:  Two words—entertainment facility—make for misleading 
and ugly tax results.
Common usage:  For most people, and even Webster’s dictionary, the 
word “facility” indicates real property. Webster defines facility to mean 
“something (as a hospital) that is built, installed, or established to serve a 
particular purpose.”1
Uncommon usage:  Tax law has a far more expansive definition of “facil -
ity.” The ugly “entertainment facility” rules prohibit deductions, except 
for things discussed later, for any real or personal property owned, rented, 
or used by a taxpayer in connection with an entertainment activity.2 The 
legislative history says this includes, among others,3 
l hunting lodges,
l airplanes,
l beach cottages,
l automobiles,
l fishing camps,
l hotel suites,
l swimming pools,
l ski lodges,
l tennis courts, and
l bowling alleys.
The entertainment facility rules are deadly. With exceptions discussed 
later, the general rule is NO deduction for any real or personal property 
used for entertainment. Further, ONE entertainment use can DESTROY 
ALL of the deductions for that real or personal property.
One entertainment is fatal:  James Gordon argued that his boat was 
not an entertainment facility because he used it only incidentally during 
the year in connection with entertainment. The court noted that the law 
says that any use of that boat for entertainment is fatal to Gordon’s boat 
deductions.4
44NotesTechnical note:  Although Gordon may have qualified for one of the ex -
ceptions below, he never made those claims at trial.
Applying the one-taint rule:  With certain exceptions, as we will discuss in 
a moment, any use of real or personal property for entertainment destroys 
all deductions for that real or personal property.
The Ireland case:  Thomas Brown Ireland held various meetings at his 
three-acre beachfront property. He met with investment advisors and with 
current and prospective clients to discuss business opportunities. He also 
met with salesmen, trainees, and other partners in his business. The court 
noted that these activities are valid business activities, not entertainment. 
However, on occasion, the business guests brought their families with 
them to the meetings. Often, the meetings lasted three days. The family 
members did not attend the meetings. The court noted that the family 
members probably played on the beach and spent the night at the beach 
home partying. The court noted that any use of this beach home for enter -
tainment, no matter how small, is fatal to the claimed deduction because 
IRS Code Section 274(a)(1)(b) operates as an absolute bar to a facility 
deduction when there is any entertainment.5
Golf clubs provide another example: Say you are a sales person who pe -
riodically plays golf with prospects. You may qualify to deduct the cost of 
golf as an entertainment expense, but you may not deduct the golf clubs, 
because your entertainment use makes the golf clubs a nondeductible 
entertainment facility.
Planning note:  Although you may not deduct the golf clubs, you may 
deduct the cost of greens fees and other non-property items, including golf 
lessons. The legislative history specifically exempts out-of-pocket enter -
tainment costs from the disallowance rules.6
Another bad rule:  If the facility rule disallows any deductions, the tax -
payer must treat the facility as an asset used by the individual for personal, 
living, and family purposes.7 Thus, if you operate your business as a C cor -
poration and you lose a deduction under the entertainment facility rule, 
l your corporation gets taxed on the disallowance, and
l you get a constructive dividend equal to the disallowance.
In other words, both you and your corporation get taxed. Yes, that’s right, 
double taxation—the worst possible result!
 45NotesMake Your Entertainment Facility Immune from 
the “No Deduction” Rules
In addition to out-of-pocket costs, tax law grants immunity from the 100 per -
cent entertainment facility disallowance rule to certain types and uses of fa -
cilities. Following are six common immunities that may fit in your planning. 
1. Transportation immunity:  You may deduct the transportation component 
of your automobile or airplane or other transportation facility.8 Other trans -
portation property could easily include a boat or a horse. 
Entertainment use of transportation assets does not produce deductions. In 
general, the IRS ignores incidental entertainment use of transportation assets, 
like using your car a minimal percentage of the time for transportation to and 
from entertainment activities. However, if you had a truck that you used only 
for hunting, the entertainment facility rules would destroy your truck depre -
ciation deductions.
Planning tip:  Although the law destroys your truck depreciation deduction, it 
does not destroy your deductions for gas, oil, and other out-of-pocket costs for 
the entertainment use.
Horse example:  If you use a horse to walk the borders of the properties that 
you sell, that horse is a business transportation horse. If you also use that 
horse 30 percent of the time for business entertainment, you then have a 70 
percent transportation horse and a 30 percent nondeductible entertainment 
facility horse.
Airplane example:  If you use an airplane 80 percent for business trips and 20 
percent for hunting trips with your clients, you may deduct only 80 percent of 
the airplane.9 The remaining 20 percent is a nondeductible facility expense. 
Need more than 50 percent business use:  Both the legislative history10 and 
Technical Advice Memorandum 9608004 state that transportation facilities, 
like airplanes and automobiles, must be used more than 50 percent for busi -
ness to qualify for the transportation exception to the entertainment facility 
disallowance rules. Therefore, make sure that you have more than 50 percent 
business use of your transportation property. 
2. 1099 immunity:  If you put the cost of using your entertainment facility 
on IRS Form 1099 and consider it compensation for services rendered, or 
as a prize or award to the recipient, you deduct your entertainment facility 
expenses as compensation to the recipient. To make this work, the statute and 
the regulations require that you file all the required IRS Forms 1099.11 
Note:  you must file a Form 1099 when the value of entertainment compensa -
tion is $600 or more. If the value of the entertainment is less than $600, no 
Form 1099 is required to make the entertainment deductible. 
In Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc., the court allowed Sutherland to de -
46Notesduct its entire cost of providing the company plane to its employees for vaca -
tion use, even though the cost exceeded the amount treated as compensation 
by the regulations. In making this ruling, the court noted the interpretation of 
the “to the extent that” language found in the legislative history. This means 
“to the extent” you call it compensation to the user, the facility is exempt 
from the entertainment facility rules.12
In the Sutherland case, the court cited the legislative history example of the 
manufacturer who allowed use of its entertainment facility by its dealers. In 
the example, the manufacturer is not subject to the entertainment facility lim -
its because the manufacturer includes the value of the entertainment facilities 
in the income of the dealers. In other words, the entertainment facility rules 
do not apply “to the extent that” the use is included in the dealer’s income. 
3. The W-2 immunity:  You may deduct your entertainment facility “to the 
extent that” you treat the use of that facility as compensation to an employee, 
with proper13 
l classifications on your original tax return, and 
l proper payroll filings of the W-2, 941, etc.
4. Immunity for the employee entertainment facility:  You could make your 
entertainment facility an employee fringe benefit. If you have an entertain -
ment facility that is for use by your employees generally, like a swimming 
pool, baseball diamond, bowling alley, or golf course, you may deduct the 
cost of that entertainment facility as an employee welfare benefit.14 However, 
any expenditure for an activity that discriminates in favor of employees or of -
ficers, shareholders or other owners, or highly compensated employees is not 
made primarily for the benefit of employees generally. 
5. Immunity for employee, stockholder, and other business meetings:  The 
entertainment facility rules do not apply to bona fide business meetings with 
your employees, stockholders, agents, or directors.15 This break applies only 
when your principal purpose of the meetings is bona fide business discus -
sions.16 
Examples:  The IRS says that you meet this exception when you gather your 
employees for a bona fide meeting to instruct them in a new procedure for 
conducting your business.17 Similarly, the IRS says that you meet this excep -
tion when you hold a bona fide meeting of the stockholders to elect directors 
and discuss corporate affairs.18 These are just two examples, but that should 
give you some ideas.
6. Lodging immunity:  The legislative history of the entertainment facility 
law says that the entertainment facility rule does not disallow otherwise al -
lowable deductions for items related to bona fide business expenses incurred 
while away from home overnight.19
 47NotesHow the Entertainment Facility Rules Apply to a 
Hunting Lease
What works? The “no-deduction-for-entertainment-facilities rules” do not 
apply to regular business entertainment activities. For example, if you take a 
customer hunting for a day at a commercial shooting preserve, you deduct the 
expenses of the hunt, like the costs for the20
l hunting rights, 
l dogs, and 
l guide.
Of course, you must properly document the entertainment deductions as pro -
vided under current law .
You qualify for deduction of this commercial hunt because you do not have 
exclusive use of the commercial hunting preserve for just one day. Thus, the 
expenses you incurred for this one day are out-of-pocket expenses.
What does not work? On Shore Quality Control Specialist, Inc. entered into 
an oral hunting lease with Mr. Robert Carr. On Shore renewed the hunting 
lease annually for 13 years, paying Mr. Carr $10,000 annually for the “right 
to hunt” in years 12 and 13. On Shore had the exclusive right to hunt on the 
ranch, with the limited exception that Mr. Carr could also hunt on the ranch 
and allow some of his friends and business acquaintances to hunt.
The tax court ruled that On Shore may not deduct its hunting lease because 
its “exclusive lease” makes the hunting lease an entertainment facility.21
In addition, if On Shore owned its guns, dogs, and other personal property 
used for hunting, the “exclusive use” rules would kill deductions for the guns, 
dogs and other personal property.
Planning tip:  Make your hunting lease payments on a short-term, out-of-
pocket basis to protect your tax deductions.
Consider Incorporating Your Entertainment 
Facility as a Second Business
Blanche and Harry Mellon own 100 percent of Tennis Now, Inc., an S cor -
poration that operates a tennis club. The facility is not open to the public. It 
makes all of its money from charity tennis events, a few tennis tournaments, 
and fees from Mellon Corporation for use of the tennis facility by Mellon em -
ployees and clients. The Mellon Corporation is another S corporation owned 
100 percent by Blanche and Harry.
Mellon Corporation pays Tennis Now, Inc., whenever Mellon’s employees 
or clients use the tennis facility. Mellon Corporation deducts the tennis fees 
as entertainment expenses subject to the 50 percent limit on entertainment 
expenses.
48NotesBlanche uses the facility every week, but Harry uses the facility only 
occasionally.
The IRS field office questioned the close relationship between the two entities 
and worried that the transactions between these two entities, both owned 100 
percent by Blanche and Harry, were designed to negate the rules that prohibit 
deductions for entertainment facilities. 
In technical advice, the national office told the field office that Tennis Now, 
Inc., is a bona fide second business operated by an independent entity, the 
S corporation owned by Blanche and Harry Mellon.22 Accordingly, Tennis 
Now, Inc., could report its income and deductions as a separate business 
not subject to the entertainment facility rules because it had a profit motive. 
Mellon Corporation could deduct each use of the facility as entertainment, 
subject to the regular entertainment rules.
Planning tip:  Consider a separate corporation for your entertainment facility.

 49Notes Section 8
How to Build Audit-Proof 
Support for Entertainment
Definition of entertainment:  The IRS states: “The term ‘entertainment’ 
means any activity which is of a type generally considered to constitute 
entertainment, amusement, or recreation, such as entertaining at night -
clubs, cocktail lounges, theaters, country clubs, golf and athletic clubs, 
sporting events, and on hunting, fishing, vacation, and similar trips, includ -
ing such activity relating solely to the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s family. ”1 [Em -
phasis added]
Conflict:  Tax law does not allow a deduction for personal, family, or liv -
ing expenses.2
Technical note:  The entertainment rules allow personal absorption of 
expenses. IRS regulations state that entertainment may include an activ -
ity, the cost of which is claimed as a business expense by the taxpayer, that 
satisfies the personal, living, or family needs of any individual.3
Documentation required:  For each element of entertainment, you must 
prove five elements:
l Amount of each separate expenditure except incidentals that can 
be aggregated.4 The IRS allows you to prove amounts less than $75 
simply by making an entry in your tax diary.5 For amounts of $75 and 
over, you must have receipts.6
l Date of entertainment.7
l Place. Name, address or location, and type of entertainment, such as 
dinner or theater, if such information is not apparent from the name.8
l Business purpose. The business reason or business benefit derived or 
expected from the entertainment.9
l Business relationship. Occupation or other information relating to the 
person or persons entertained, including name, title, or other designa -
tion sufficient to establish business relationship to the taxpayer.10
Planning tip:  Make your diary entries stand up! Enter your specific busi -
ness purpose for the entertainment. Let your entry show how you tried to 
achieve that specific business purpose. For example, “Asked for referrals—
got none!” Or “Learned Matt’s close—revised mine!”

 51NotesTime saver:  You do not need an essay to support your entertainment 
deductions, but you do need to be specific about your hoped-for future 
benefit.
Failure to satisfy the documentation standards means you lose the 
deduction.11
Diary entry:  Tax law expects you to record your entertainment expenses 
at or near the time of expenditure, when you have full present knowledge 
of the elements.12 You may record the expenses in an appointment book or 
any record. You generally meet the rules when you record
l who you entertained, 
l where you entertained, and 
l why you entertained.
General rules:  You may deduct entertainment only if it meets either:13
l the directly related test or
l the associated test
Directly related entertainment either (1) meets four requirements or (2) oc -
curs in a clear business setting. 
The four requirements are:
1. At the time you committed to spend the money, you had more than a 
general expectation of future business.14
2. During the entertainment, you actively discussed the topic that could 
produce future business benefit.15
3. Your principal reason for the activity was the active conduct of your 
business.16
4. You incurred the expense to speak with the person who produced 
your general expectation of future business.17
If you intended to do the items above, but circumstances beyond your con -
trol prevented you from doing so, you still may deduct the costs as directly 
related entertainment.18
Clear setting:  You do not have to meet the four requirements above if 
you spent the money in a clear business setting. The clear business setting 
exception makes the entertainment automatically deductible as directly 
related entertainment.19 Entertainment occurs in a clear business setting 
when:20
l The person with whom you have the business discussion knows you 
are spending your money on the entertainment to directly further your 
business.
l You spend your money in a hospitality room at a convention where 
you display your products to further your business.

 53Notesl You have no meaningful social or personal relationship with the 
people with whom you have the business discussion.
Business setting:  You do not qualify for directly related entertainment 
when the entertainment takes place in a setting where you have little pos -
sibility of engaging in an active business discussion.21 Locations that make 
a business discussion unlikely include nightclubs, theaters, sporting events, 
and cocktail parties.22 For directly related entertainment, the surroundings 
should be such that you have no substantial distractions to discussion.23 
The IRS considers as conducive to business discussion a restaurant, hotel 
dining room, or similar place that does not involve distracting influences, 
such as a floorshow .24
Associated entertainment:  If your entertainment is not directly related 
to the active conduct of your business, you may not deduct that entertain -
ment unless:25
l The entertainment is associated with the active conduct of your busi -
ness, and
l The associated entertainment directly precedes or follows a substantial 
and bona fide business discussion.
Associated entertainment does not have to involve a business discussion. It 
takes place in a setting not conducive to a business discussion. To deduct 
associated entertainment, you must have a substantial and bona fide busi -
ness discussion before or after the entertainment.
Place for associated business discussion:  The business discussion may 
occur in the office or in any other business setting, like during a directly 
related entertainment meal. In such cases, you may deduct the associated 
entertainment with no further action on your part.26 In other words, if you 
have your substantial and bona fide business discussion over dinner and 
then go to the theater, you deduct both the dinner and the theater.
Timing of associated discussion:  How soon before or after the associ -
ated entertainment must you have the substantial and bona fide business 
discussion? The same day always qualifies.27 If the entertainment does not 
occur on the day of the business discussion, all circumstances are consid -
ered, including the reasons for not entertaining on the day of the business 
discussion. The IRS says that entertainment of an out-of-town customer 
qualifies as associated if you have the business discussion on the day be -
fore or day after the entertainment.28
Example:  You and your spouse take the Nelsons to dinner and discuss an 
investment program with them. After dinner, you and your spouse take the 
Nelsons to the ballgame, where no business discussions take place. You 
deduct the entire cost of the $250 dinner and the $150 spent at the ball -
game.

 55NotesHow the IRS looks at entertainment:  In an audit of entertainment, the 
IRS tells its examiners to look for:29
l An ordinary and necessary business reason for the entertainment 
l A directly related business discussion (about a product, request for 
referrals, or other future business)
l Substantiation (who, where, why)
The IRS notes that entertainment, promotion, and advertising expenses 
are areas that give rise to audit issues. In one case, the IRS found a taxpay -
er who claimed over $60,000 in deductions for front-center seats to rock 
concerts. The taxpayer took prospects, colleagues, and clients to concerts 
to gain exposure to rock groupies, roadies, and stars that might produce 
music business clients. The IRS tells its examiners that they should argue 
the reasonableness of that assertion!
We more than agree.  You need to write down why you entertained some -
one after each entertainment. You should directly relate your “why” to 
your business, and the associated “rock concert” should follow or precede 
your bona fide directly related business discussion. The business discus -
sion should take place in surroundings conducive to business discussions 
(like at a table in a quiet restaurant).

New Law Makes Home Office 
Available to You
Eliminates commute:  The IRS says, “If you have an office in your home 
that qualifies as a principal place of business, you can deduct your daily 
transportation costs between your home and another work location in the 
same trade or business.”1
You may have more than one office:  Then, in its business use of home 
publication, the IRS says, “You can have more than one business location, 
including your home, for a single trade or business.”2 
Put an administrative office in your home to produce a principal office:  
The IRS goes on to say, “Your home office will qualify as your principal 
place of business for deducting expenses for its use if you meet the follow -
ing requirements:3
1. You use it exclusively and regularly for administrative or management 
activities of your trade or business. 
2. You have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial ad -
ministrative or management activities of your trade or business.” 
This is the word:  Note that these are exact quotes from the IRS. What 
this means is that if you do your administrative work at home and not at 
your other office or offices, your home office is your principal office. If 
your home office is your principal office, your other office is a secondary 
office. The IRS says that you can deduct your vehicle expenses for trips 
from your administrative office to your secondary office.
Administrative or managerial activities:  The IRS says, “There are many 
activities that are administrative or managerial in nature. The following 
are a few examples:4 
l Billing customers, clients, or patients. 
l Keeping books and records. 
l Ordering supplies. 
l Setting up appointments. 
l Forwarding orders or writing reports.”
 
What do you do?  Do you pay the bills for your business? Keep the finan -
cial records and take care of the business plan? Order supplies and equip -
ment? Read the business mail? These are the types of things that qualify as 
administrative or management activities. 
58NotesYour choice:  The IRS gives you lots of flexibility with your home office. 
For example, if you have suitable space at one of your outside-the-home 
offices to conduct administrative or management activities, but choose to 
use your home office instead, no problem. Your choice does not disallow 
the home office.5 
Administrative in secondary office:  The IRS says that you can occasion -
ally conduct minimal administrative or management activities at a fixed 
location outside your home, for example, in one of your satellite offices.6 
No problem. This does not hurt your home office.
  
Helpers don’t hurt:  Similarly, you may have others conduct your admin -
istrative or management activities, for example, using a bookkeeper or an 
outside billing company. 
Sales office does not hurt : You qualify for the principal office in your 
home even when you conduct substantial nonadministrative or nonman -
agement business activities at a fixed location outside your home.7 For ex -
ample, you meet with or provide services to customers, clients, or patients 
at a fixed location of the business outside your home.
An “on-point” example: The IRS uses an anesthesiologist example in its 
publication, which is pretty much on point and follows:8
Paul is a self-employed anesthesiologist. He spends the majority of  his time admin -
istering anesthesia and postoperative care in three local hospitals. One of  the hospi -
tals provides him with a small shared office where he could conduct administrative 
or management activities. 
Paul does not use the office the hospital provides. He uses a room in his home that 
he has converted to an office. He uses this room exclusively and regularly to conduct 
all the following activities:
l Contacting patients, surgeons, and hospitals regarding scheduling. 
l Preparing for treatments and presentations. 
l Maintaining billing records and patient logs. 
l Satisfying continuing medical education requirements. 
l Reading medical journals and books. 
Paul’s home office qualifies as his principal place of  business for deducting expenses 
for its use. He conducts administrative or management activities for his business as 
an anesthesiologist there and he has no other fixed location where he conducts ad -
ministrative or management activities for this business. His choice to use his home 
office instead of  one provided by the hospital does not disqualify his home office 
from being his principal place of  business. His performance of  substantial nonad -
ministrative or nonmanagement activities at fixed locations outside his home also 
 59Notesdoes not disqualify his home office from being his principal place of  business. He 
meets all the qualifications, including principal place of  business . . .
You probably are just like Paul!
Three Easy Rules Give You the Home Office
The new law rules became effective on January 1, 1999—and they are 
easy. To gain the benefits described in this section, you must use your 
home office:9
l For administrative or management duties
l Exclusively for business
l Regularly for business
Rule 1—Administrative or management use:  See the discussion at the 
beginning of this section.
Rule 2—Use the office regularly for business:  You must exclusively use 
your home office on a regular basis for this administration or management 
activity. The court ruled in Green that Green’s use of the home office for 
a little more than 10 hours a week met the regular-use test.10 Unlike some 
cases where the courts found the use not regular, Green used his office 
every week, except for vacations. So make your use repetitive and frequent 
to ensure that it is regular.
Proving regular use:  How do you prove “regular use”? One clear way to 
make your presentation is to make entries in your appointment book, as 
we did below . When you do the 90-day test for your car and other listed 
property, simply track your body, too. It’s easy. Below, we logged our body 
as it used the office in the home. The logging clearly shows the home of -
fice use.
Note for coporate owners: 
IRC Section 280A(c)(6) 
prohibits claiming deductions 
for the rental of your home 
office to your corporation. 
Therefore, the corporation 
should:
1. require you to find an of-
fice for the convenience of 
the corporation, and
2. reimburse you for your 
home office expenses (use 
IRS Form 8829 to figure the 
reimbursement).
When reimbursed, the cor-
poraton gets the deduction 
and you, the employee, do 
not report the reimburse-
ment as income. This gives 
you the home office deduc-
tion on the corporation’s 
books.
Reg. Section 1.62-(d)(1) al-
lows reimbursement of home 
office, including depreciation 
and Section 179 deductions.
60NotesOverview Calculation of Home Office Monetary Benefits
The administrative home office eliminates commut -
ing. Smith, our example taxpayer, erases 9 miles of 
commute a day. That’s 18 miles round trip, 90 miles a 
week, 4,500 miles a year converted from ugly personal 
to beautiful business miles. In Smith’s case, the 4,500 
miles increased his car deductions by $3,150 a year.
Y ou need a place to live—why not deduct part of that 
place? It makes no difference if you own or rent. With the 
home office deduction, you convert otherwise personal 
expenses to business deductions. 
Most of these expenses are expenses you have no 
matter what. Mortgage interest, property taxes, utilities, 
homeowners insurance, pest control, repairs, and paint 
are all common home expenses.
 
Extra benefits from mortgage interest: On the mortgage 
interest you already pay, you convert the home office 
part (17 percent in this case) to business and deduct it 
against your self-employment income. If your business 
income is:
l Under the Social Security maximum, you gain 15.3 
percent in extra tax benefits.
l Over the Social Security maximum, you gain 2.9 
percent Medicare tax benefit.Eliminates Commuting and Takes Advantage of Your Living Costs25% federal taxes, 
7.5% state taxes, 
and 15.3% self-
employment taxes 
make up the 47.8% 
rate
More cash from the phaseouts: Then, no matter if you 
are over or under the Social Security maximum, you 
gain on those sneaky phaseout taxes that apply to:
l Reducing your itemized deductions
l Reducing your personal exemptions
l Limiting your real estate rental deductions
l Cutting back your child credits
The phaseout tax benefits alone could produce 20 
percent or more in benefits depending on your situation. 
To calculate the true after-tax benefit in your individual 
case, do your tax return two ways—with and without the 
home office and vehicle benefits.
Cash benefits from depreciation: Depreciation on this 
home produces $553 in annual after-tax cash benefits. 
When Smith sells, he will pay a recapture tax of $289 
(25 percent x $1,156), pocketing $264 on the deprecia -
tion deduction.
Claim office until death: When you die, the law forgives 
the home office and marks up the home to fair market 
value for estate tax purposes. The markup for estate tax 
purposes does not trigger any depreciation recapture or 
capital gains taxes on the death transfer.Gross%

 61NotesKeep correspondence:  Do one more thing. Keep incoming correspon -
dence and photocopies of outgoing correspondence. Just toss it in a file or 
a box by date. Don’t spend time on it, unless you need it. Then, if you ever 
need supporting evidence, the correspondence file will prove itself a gold 
mine. 
The correspondence file often produces highly beneficial documents that 
you can use for far more than your taxes. Simply get in the habit of copy -
ing all written documents that you send out, even thank-you notes.
Rule 3—Use the office exclusively for business:  The final hurdle to 
claiming the home office deduction is “exclusive use.” You must use the 
room, rooms, or area exclusively for qualifying business use as an office 
and for no other purpose.11 
Think proof! How do you prove exclusive business use? 
Curphey proved his exclusive use by showing that the room he used as 
an office contained only business furniture and no personal-use furniture 
like a television, sofa, or bed. What would be good proof in this situation? 
Photographs! How could you prove when you took them? Have them 
developed by a processor that dates the photos.
The business bed:  If your room has a bed or other indications of potential 
personal use, again, think proof. Photos of the bed covered with files can 
help prove business use of the bed. If you have no storage area for the bed 
and the bed is simply too good to give away, you have additional evidence. 
Neither of these by itself will prove exclusive use, but both help. 
Is the Home Office a Big Red Flag?
Home office deduction does not cause an audit.  We asked about 3,000 
self-employed taxpayers who claimed the home office if the IRS had au -
dited them during the past five years. Their answers showed that the IRS 
had audited almost none of them.
Further, this is a new law, and there really is no audit history yet. Under 
the old law, it was very difficult to qualify for the home office deduction. 
You had to assume that ultra-strict tax rules would have caused lots of 
audits, which, of course, we now know is not what happened at all.
62NotesSummary
The new rules on the home office deduction put cash in your pocket from 
the place where you live and the vehicle you drive. You don’t need to find 
a different place to live. You don’t have to buy a more expensive vehicle. 
You need to spend a little time building proof. Get serious here! Only a 
few hours a year building proof for tax benefits can, in just five years, put 
$21,242 (more or less) in after-tax cash in your pocket.
Let’s face it. You already work at home and do most of what’s needed to 
meet the rules. Your effort to pocket this cash is nothing compared with 
the benefits.
Keep this workbook handy. Read the rules several times and get started. 
Then put the workbook in a place where you can read it once a year, so 
that you remember what you have to do and why you want to do it.

Putting the IRS Audit Manual’s 
Home-Office Section to Work for 
You 
The IRS audit manual contains not only information on how to audit your 
tax returns but also boilerplate language for auditors to use when they 
disallow your deductions. The boilerplate disallowance explanations are 
instructive because they 
help you focus on the rules, l
highlight common mistakes your fellow taxpayers are making, and l
help you develop an audit-proof plan.  l
With respect to the home office, the IRS audit force has 19 boilerplate 
paragraphs that explain why the IRS is not going to give you some or all 
of your claimed home-office deductions.1 We dissected those 19 para -
graphs and built 11 audit-proofing tactics to ensure that you get every 
single deduction you deserve. We discussed the first 3 of the 11 tactics in 
the previous section of this course. Here, we will discuss the remaining 
eight, plus new rules on cell phones.
Remember, when you claim the home-office deduction, you achieve two 
valuable monetary results:
The home office produces tax benefits for money you would spend on 1. 
your home, no matter what.
As an administrative office in your home, the home office becomes 2. 
your principal office, which eliminates commuting to work. With no 
more commuting, you put more after-tax benefits from your vehicle in 
your bank account. 
Benefit example 1.  You make $10,000 worth of repairs that benefit your 
entire home. Without the home office, you can deduct nothing. Repairs 
to a home are not deductible. With an office that takes 20 percent of your 
home, you deduct $2,000 ($10,000 x 20 percent). 
Benefit example 2.  You drive a $50,000 vehicle that you will sell for 
$10,000 after you use it in your business. With no home office, you have 
60 percent business use—deductions of $24,000 on the cost of this vehicle. 
With an administrative office in your home that eliminates commuting, 
you now have 90 percent business use—deductions of $36,000 on the cost 
of this vehicle, a $12,000  improvement. 
 63Notes
You can see that establishing a home office adds to your bank account. 
But you cannot depend on that extra cash making it into your account un -
less your home office is audit-proof. 
Here are the eight remaining tactics you need to make sure all your deduc -
tions make it to your bank account.
1. Pass the Convenience-of-Employer Test If You 
Operate as a Corporation
If you operate your business as a corporation and claim the home-office deduc -
tion, you need to prove that you use the home office for the convenience  of the 
employer, your corporation. 
Before the home-office rules changed in 1997, the convenience of the employer 
test was pretty wide open. However, with the new rules, the legislative history has 
modified the convenience test in the following manner:2 
In the case of  an employee, the question whether an employee chose not to use suitable 
space made available by the employer for administrative activities is relevant to determin -
ing whether the present-law “convenience of  the employer” test is satisfied.
The IRS had this interpretation of the legislative history paragraph quoted 
above:3 
One warning here: an employee’s decision not to use suitable space made available by the 
employer can affect the deductibility.
This means that as an owner-employee of your corporation, you need to meet 
both the basic rules for the home office and the additional convenience-of-the-
employer rule. The basic rules say that you may claim a home office if you
use the office for administrative or management activities; l
have no other fixed place where you conduct substantial administrative or  l
management activities; and
use the office exclusively and regularly as a place of business. l
Once you establish that you meet the basic rules, you need to spend some time 
documenting how and why you meet the convenience-of-the-employer test. Your 
best bet is to have the corporation write you a letter requiring you to do your 
administrative or management activities at home for a valid business reason. For 
example, your corporation might require your administrative or management 
work be carried out at home
to protect the confidentiality of the payroll and accounting records; l
to ensure that your work at the office focuses on sales (patient care, produc -  l
tion);
because the office has inadequate space to accommodate the payables re -  l
cords, invoices, receipts, and so on; or
to facilitate uninterrupted attention to business plans and budgets.  l
64Notes
This list is by no means exhaustive, but it should help you target viable reasons 
you need to do your administration or management at home.
Planning note.  You must pass the convenience-of-the-employer test whether or 
not you are having the corporation reimburse you for home-office expenses. If 
you are going to have your corporation reimburse home-office expenses to you as 
an employee of the corporation, see the next section of this course for important 
details.
2. Don’t Even Think About Renting Your Home 
Office to Your Employer 
If you claim the home-office deduction as an employee business expense, you 
place that deduction in the miscellaneous itemized deductions category. This is a 
bad place. Here, your miscellaneous deductions are going to suffer either 
a reduction of up to 2 percent of adjusted gross income, or  l
elimination, if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax.  l
As you can see, this bad place produces bad results. 
You cannot  avoid these bad results by renting your home office to your employer. 
Section 280A(c)(6) prohibits the home-office deduction for rentals of a home 
office to an employer. 
The perfect solution.  Have the corporation reimburse you for the home-office 
deduction. This gives the corporation the deduction. You get cash as a reim -
bursed employee expense, and that cash reimbursement is not taxable to you. 
With the reimbursement, you also avoid both the 2 percent problem and the 
alternative minimum tax problems. The reimbursement gives you the best result 
if you operate your business as a corporation. 
3. Don’t Fret About the Gross Income Limit
Your home-office deduction is limited to the income from your business. It’s 
simple. No income, no deduction. Little income, little deduction. 
Regardless, you should claim the home office if you can. Why? Expenses disal -
lowed by the income limit this year, because you did not make enough money, 
carry over to next year, and the year after, and every year thereafter until you 
make enough money to use them. You don’t lose the deductions. Think of the 
disallowed deductions as going into a holding tank where they wait for release; 
when you do have income, they can attack and reduce that taxable income.
4. Classify Your Repairs Properly
You incur three types of repairs:
Repairs that benefit the entire house l
Repairs that benefit only the personal part of the house l
Repairs that benefit only the office part of the house l
 65Notes
You may deduct the business percentage of the repairs that benefit the 
entire house and the repairs that benefit only the office part of the house. 
Example 1. l  You paint the outside of the home. This benefits the en -
tire house. You deduct your business percentage of this repair.
Example 2. l  You add electrical outlets to the room you use as an of -
fice. You expense the entire cost of this electrical repair.
Example 3. l  You repair the floor in the kitchen. This repair gives you 
zero home-office benefit.
Build better records of your repairs by making brief notes on the repair 
invoices and receipts indicating the area benefited (entire house, personal 
part, or office part). 
5. Prove Your Expenses
You need receipts and canceled checks to back up your home-office ex -
penses. Keep your mortgage payment statements, property tax statements, 
and utility bills, and obtain receipts for repairs and maintenance and all 
other claimed expenses and improvements. Receipts and invoices prove 
what you bought. 
Canceled checks and online payments prove that you paid the money. 
You need both kinds of proof: what you bought and the fact that that you 
paid for your purchases.
6. Take Advantage of Lawn Care and 
Landscaping Issues
The IRS does not want your home-office deduction to include any land -
scaping or lawn care. In fact, the IRS has a proposed regulation disallow -
ing landscaping and lawn care as part of the home office. This proposed 
regulation was issued on August 7, 1980, although it has never made it to 
a final regulation. 
The IRS audit manual tells IRS agents and auditors not to allow your lawn 
care and landscaping. That’s the IRS’s side of the story. There is another 
side of the story.
Charles Hefti faced and beat the proposed regulations in court. He got the 
court to look at the proposed regulation and conclude that his lawn care 
and landscaping costs were deductible to the extent of his business-use 
percentage. The court found that Hefti had clients visiting on a regular 
basis and that the appearance of the residence and the grounds were of 
significance to Hefti’s business operation.4
66Notes
In Rhoads , the court allowed the lawn-care deduction and stated that al -
though the home-office regulations had not been a subject of the case, the 
court felt that the ruling was correct given the regulations.5
In Neilson , the IRS disallowed the lawn-care deduction in its audit, but the 
court overturned the disallowance and allowed the lawn-care deduction 
for the Neilsons’ child-care center operated out of their residence.6
Two of these cases confronted the proposed regulations directly, and both 
taxpayers won. The IRS has yet to win a lawn-care-deduction-denial case 
under its 1980 proposed regulations.
What does this mean to you? It means you should claim the lawn care if 
you have significant justification. As in the court cases cited above, the ex -
terior appearance of your home office needs to be of enough value to your 
business to demonstrate a business incentive for the work. Should you face 
the IRS on this issue, one of the following three things will happen:
You will back down and give up the deduction. l
The IRS will back down and give you the deduction. l
You and the IRS will duke it out in court. l
7. Identify Your Depreciable Basis
The basis of your home is original cost, plus improvements, minus depre -
ciation. If your home has declined in value, you must use the lower market 
value as your basis. Also, if you used the section 1034 tax-deferred rollover 
rules that existed before 1999, your basis was adjusted in the rollover. 
You depreciate the building, not the land; therefore, your first step to 
claiming the home-office deduction is to divide the basis of your home 
between building and land. An appraisal or the tax assessor’s statement 
makes good evidence for allocating basis between land and building.
Example.  You are going to claim the home-office deduction for the first 
time this year. You bought your home in 1999 for $250,000. You have a 
tax assessor’s property tax statement for your 1999 property taxes that 
shows the value of the land to be equal to 20 percent of the total value. On 
the basis of this statement, you allocate 80 percent of the $250,000 to the 
building and start depreciating your business percentage of the $200,000 
cost this year.
In your tax file, you should have documents that prove your acquisition 
cost, improvements, and allocation between land and building.
 67Notes
8. Deduct the Proper Amount of Your Phone Bill
Lawmakers enacted section 262(b), which states that you must treat as a personal 
expense any charge for basic local telephone service to any residence. However, 
long-distance business phone calls on the first telephone line, as well as the cost 
of a second line used exclusively for business, are deductible business expenses.7 
Further, charges for optional services offered by the telephone company, such as 
call waiting, call forwarding, speed or three-way calling, extra directory listings, 
and equipment rentals are deductible to the extent of business use.8 
Cell Phones (New Rules)
Break for Employees, Including Corporate Owner-Employees
In IRS Notice 2011-72, the IRS said
it will not tax the value of employees’ personal use of employer-provided  l
cell phones, and 
employees and employers do not have to keep any records of their cell  l
phone use.
To qualify for this tax-favored treatment, the employer must provide the employ -
ee with a cell phone primarily for “noncompensatory business purposes” such as 
the following (and you are going to love these):
The employer needs to be able to contact the employee at all times in case of 1. 
work-related emergencies.
The employer requires that the employee be available to speak with clients 2. 
when away from the office.
The employee needs to speak with clients located in other time zones at 3. 
times outside of the employee’s normal workday.
If you operate as a corporation, you should have no problem satisfying one or 
more of the three criteria above.
Your corporation need not buy you a cell phone. Instead, it can pay you a cash 
allowance and/or reimburse you for your personal cell phone use.9 If you pay a 
flat monthly fee for your cell phone service, your corporation can reimburse you 
for the entire amount even though you use the phone for both personal and busi -
ness calls.10
Caution.  Cell phones given to an employee solely to boost morale or to serve as 
additional compensation create taxable income for the employee.11
Cell Phones for the Sole Proprietor and the Single-Member LLC
The IRS’s no-hassle cell-phone break applies to your employees, but not to you if 
are a sole proprietor or the owner of a single-member LLC.
If you are in the out-of-favor group, you deduct your monthly business-related 
cell phone costs the same as any other business operating expense, such as rent or 
utilities. You depreciate the cost of the cell phone itself, just like any other capital 
property, such as computers.
68Notes
Your sole piece of good news comes from the change in the law, not from the 
IRS. Cell phones are no longer listed property. That makes things easier.
But unlike those who own corporations, you are required to offer proof of your 
percentage of business use. If you use the cell phone 75 percent for business and 
25 percent for personal, your deduction for depreciation and monthly charges is 
based on your 75 percent business use. 
To prove the 75 percent, you need to keep track of your calls. One easy method is 
to simply tally the business and personal calls that show on your cell phone bill as 
proof of your business and personal use.12
You don’t necessarily have to go through every cell phone bill for the entire year 
and categorize each and every call. If you make about the same number of calls 
every month, you can use a sampling method, say, for three months.13
If you hate the idea of checking off the calls on your phone bill, consider acquir -
ing two phone numbers for your cell phone: one for business and one for person -
al use.14 Technology now makes this possible.
Special Category for Independent Contractors
The IRS grants independent contractors tax-free, tax-favored employee status 
for cell phones given to them or reimbursed to them by their employers (clients, 
customers, brokers, etc.).15
This favored-employee status does not apply to independent contractors who 
are not reimbursed by an employer. Unreimbursed independent contractors are 
proprietorships for cell phone use and thus subject to the prove-your-cell-phone-
use rules.
Phone is a Utility
Although you’ll find the phone disallowance paragraph in the home-office sec -
tion of the IRS audit manual and in the IRS publication on the home office, the 
IRS makes it clear that phone charges are not home-office expenses. According 
to the IRS, you should label your phone charges as utilities.16
Summary
Remember, the eight tactics above and the three in the prior section were de -
rived from the 19 standard paragraphs in the audit manual that IRS personnel 
use when they tell you why the IRS is not going to give you some or all of your 
claimed deductions. Pay attention and put into practice those parts of the 11 
tactics that apply to your home-office deduction. 
Think of the home-office deduction as a money stream to your bank account. 
You need a place to live, so you incur these expenses no matter what. When you 
claim the home-office deduction, the law grants you deductions for monies that 
you are going to spend whether or not you are in business.

Section 11
Why Incorporation Makes Your 
Home-Office Deduction Less 
Subject to an IRS Audit
If you filed your business income and expenses as a proprietor and re -
ported $100,000 or more in gross receipts, your chances of being selected 
for an IRS audit the following year were 3.52 percent.1 Had you reported 
this income as an S corporation, your chances of audit were only 0.40 
percent.2 
You have probably read that the home office increases your chances of 
IRS audit. We’ve read that, too, but we don’t believe it. Regardless, let’s as -
sume that you’re a little paranoid about audits, and you want to claim the 
home office in a way that doesn’t attract the attention of the IRS. 
If you operate as a corporation, your home-office deduction does not 
show up on either your personal return or your corporate return if you 
have the corporation reimburse the office as an employee expense. With 
reimbursement, the corporation claims the deduction for the expenses it 
reimburses to you. The corporation probably puts the reimbursement into 
a category called “office expenses” or something similar. Thus, the home-
office deduction does not appear in the corporate return. 
You receive the reimbursement from the corporation as a reimbursed 
employee expense. You do not report employee-expense reimbursements 
as taxable income on your personal return. Thus, you do not identify the 
home office on your personal return.
The easy method to find the reimbursement amount for the corporation 
is to complete the IRS home-office deduction Form 8829. With this form, 
the corporate reimbursement to you includes the home-office percentage 
of amounts you spend for mortgage interest and property taxes. Because 
the amounts are reimbursed to you by the corporation, you do not deduct 
them on your personal return.
Example.  Your mortgage interest for the year is $10,000, and 10 percent 
of your home is office. Your corporation reimburses $1,000 (10 percent 
times $10,000), so your net mortgage interest expense for the year is 
$9,000 ($10,000 minus $1,000). You deduct the $9,000 as an itemized de -
duction on Schedule A of your 1040. 
 71Notes
When you sell your home, you treat it as though you had taken the home 
office as a personal deduction. Your corporation reimbursed you for de -
preciation, and since depreciation is subject to the recapture tax, you must 
consider the depreciation recapture problem in your home-selling strategy.
The corporation may reimburse expenses only if it has adequate proof 
of the expenses. Therefore, make your corporation demand proof that 
substantiates your administrative use, regular use, and exclusive use of the 
home office. Think of your corporation as an IRS auditor who’s making 
sure that the expenses meet the requirements of the law . If you fail the 
adequate-proof part, your corporation will have to include the expense 
reimbursements in your W-2 income.3 You do not want that. 
With proper proof, your corporation gets the tax deduction and you, the 
employee, get an employee reimbursement that is not taxable income to 
you.4 A win-win situation!
If you want the home-office deduction but are paranoid about claiming it, 
consider the corporate form of business. It does a fantastic job of hiding 
the deduction. 
However—remember—we do not consider the home office to be an audit 
flag at all. Thus, we would not incorporate just to remove the home office 
from our tax returns. 
We also understand and appreciate a certain amount of IRS-induced 
paranoia.

Section 12
Use Net Square Footage 
to Increase Home-Office 
Deductions
Have you ever wondered why it’s called the practice  of accounting? Like 
the practice of medicine, it’s never perfect.
What can happen under generally accepted accounting principles varies 
widely. For example, one airline may depreciate an airplane over 7 years, 
while another airline depreciates the identical aircraft over 17 years. Both 
approaches may meet generally accepted accounting principles, although 
they produce far different earnings-per-share numbers.
Cost accounting, too, contains variations. Public Law 100-679 requires 
educational institutions to complete a Cost Accounting Standards Board 
disclosure statement for government grants. In the disclosure statement, 
the educational institution explains its methodology for allocating indirect 
costs when seeking reimbursement under government grants. 
For example, the University of Delaware allocates its operations and 
maintenance pool costs on the net-square-footage basis. The expenses in 
this pool include the following:1
Building services l
Repairs and maintenance l
Utilities l
Heating and cooling plants and functions l
Grounds upkeep and services  l
Janitorial services l
The University of New Hampshire also uses net square footage to allocate 
its facility service costs. The university defines net square footage as gross 
square footage minus common areas such as2 
halls,  l
bathrooms,  l
stairways,  l
and foyers. l
 73Notes
When you decide what percentage of your home is devoted to the home 
office, do you use gross square footage or net square footage? In its (“I’m 
here to help you”) publication on the home office, the IRS says this:3
To find the business percentage, compare the size of  the part of  your home that you 
use for business to your whole house. Use the resulting percentage to figure the busi -
ness part of  the expenses for operating your entire home . 
The publication further states that you can use any reasonable method to 
determine your business percentage, including the method just described, 
the “number of rooms” method, or any other reasonable method. Under 
the number of rooms method, if all the rooms in your home are about 
the same size, the IRS says you can divide the number of rooms used for 
business by the total number of rooms in your home to find your business 
percentage. If you use the number of rooms, you exclude hallways, bath -
rooms, stairways, and foyers, just as the University of New Hampshire 
excludes them when asking the government for grant reimbursements.
The number-of-rooms method will probably give you the most bang for 
your buck. Unfortunately, it has two problems. Problem #1: When you 
complete IRS Form 8829, the home-office deduction form, line 2 asks for 
the “total area of your home.” That’s not compatible with the number of 
rooms, and probably scares people away from using the number-of-rooms 
method. 
Further, the instructions for Form 8829 
never mention the number-of-rooms method, and l
simply state that you may use “square feet or any other reasonable  l
method.”
The form gives you no place to disclose that you are using the number-of-
rooms method or any other method. 
Problem #2: If your home is like most homes, your rooms are not approx -
imately the same size; therefore, logic tells you simply to take a pass on the 
number of rooms method.
This brings us to the net-square-footage method, our method of choice 
for avoiding the problems you encounter in the number-of-rooms method, 
while still keeping its bang. First, this method is compatible with the tax 
form where you enter the total area of your home, because the form is 
looking for square feet. You enter net square footage on this line (the ap -
propriate measure of the usable square footage of your home).
74Notes
Let’s do this with an example.  Say you measure the outside dimensions of 
your home and that measure produces 3,500 square feet. Say further that 
the inside dimensions of your office measure 280 square feet, making your 
office 8 percent of the whole house. That’s what you claim if you simply 
read the IRS instructions and do not pay attention to your taxes. 
Now let’s remake that space using the net-square-footage method. Here 
you subtract from the gross square footage the footage consumed by
outside walls,  l
hallways,  l
bathrooms,  l
stairways,  l
foyers,  l
water heaters, l
crawl spaces, and  l
the heating and cooling plant.  l
The result will be your net usable square feet. 
Say your measure produces 2,500 net square feet. Divide the 280 square 
feet of office space by the 2,500 net square feet and you have an office 
equal to 11.2 percent of your home.
Gross method
Net square feet of office 280
Gross square feet of home 3,500
Office as a percentage of gross square footage 8%
Net method
Net square feet of office 280
Net square feet of home 2,500
Office as a percentage of net square footage 11.2%
Increase in deductions with net-square-footage method 40%Comparing Square Footage Methods
Congratulations! You’ve just won yourself a 40 percent increase in deduc -
tions, just for knowing what you’re doing. That means you now deduct 40 
percent more of your
mortgage interest (which reduces your self-employment and phaseout  l
taxes),
property taxes (which also reduces your self-employment and phase -  l
out taxes),

the size of that deduction, you need to seriously consider the net-square-footage 
method. It approximates the number-of-rooms method championed by the IRS, but it 
overcomes the impediments.
New Optional Method
In lieu of actual expenses, you may use the IRS’s new optional home-
office deduction method rather than calculate, allocate, and prove your 
home-office expenses.5
The new IRS optional method is easy. There are two steps:6
Identify the square footage of your home office (limited to a maxi - 1. 
mum of 300 square feet).
Multiply the square footage times $5 a foot.2. 
Example.  You have a deductible home office in a room that measures 15’ 
x 12’, which gives you 180 square feet of home-office space. Your IRS 
optional home-office tax deduction is $900 (180 times $5).

Revenue Procedure Shows How 
Home Office Saves Extra Taxes 
with a 1031 Exchange 
Tax knowledge is powerful stuff! Taxpayers in the know will stop selling 
their homes and start using 1031 exchanges.
In Revenue Procedure 2005-14, the IRS lays out new, helpful rules for 
combining 
l Section 1031 tax-deferred exchanges on the office part of the home 
with 
l Section 121 home-sale exclusions that allow qualified taxpayers to 
sell their homes and exclude gains of up to $250,000 if single and 
$500,000 if married filing joint returns.
Combining Code Sections 121 and 1031 can produce spectacular results, 
allowing you to 
l avoid taxes on the sale of your home,
l avoid taxes on the sale of the office part of your home,
l avoid taxes on the sale of the rental part of your home,
l avoid taxes by converting your home to a rental property, and
l defer taxes on the depreciation recapture part caused by the office or 
rental.
 
Think of it! Zero taxes this year when you use the right combination of 
Sections 121 and 1031. You can use this combination to defer and avoid 
recapture, regular, and capital gains taxes on a home
l in which you claimed a home office deduction, or
l that you used as a rental property.
The word “exchange” in Section 1031 is misleading. To effect an exchange 
under this section of the law, you “sell” your old property and “buy” 
a replacement property. Note the words “sell” and “buy.” To get the 
tax-favored treatment, you simply engage an intermediary who becomes 
both
l the substitute seller of your existing home, and
l the substitute buyer of your replacement home.
Think of the intermediary as a puppet:  You hold the strings and tell the 
intermediary exactly what you want. With a little effort, you can set this 
78Notesup so you notice almost nothing, except the tax-favored treatment. And 
the right intermediary might do all the work for a fee of $750 or so. 
Avoiding and deferring taxes is impressive. But the combination of Sec -
tions 121 and 1031 has an even more impressive side. How would you like, 
say, a $50,000 tax-free profit? That’s what you get with Section 121. But 
then it’s possible to make the $50,000 tax-free profit part of your depre -
ciable basis on the replacement property. Now that’s impressive! 
Here’s how it works with this $50,000 gain. The 121 and 1031 combina -
tion allows you to 
l pay no taxes on the $50,000 home office gain;
l add the $50,000 gain to your basis in the replacement office (located 
in the replacement home); and
l depreciate the depreciable part of the $50,000.
This is a classic example of having your cake and eating it too. It doesn’t 
get much better than this: having your tax-free gains  turn into depreciation 
deductions. Wow! 
In this section, we’ll show you how the new rules work and how they can 
provide huge benefits for you. 
How to Put the Rules to Work on Your Home 
Office
The IRS uses six examples and does a nice job in Revenue Procedure 
2005-14 of explaining how you can combine Sections 121 and 1031 to re -
duce or eliminate taxes. In general, when you sell your home, Section 121 
grants tax-free treatment to gains of up to $250,000 (single) or $500,000 
(married). 
Home office inside the dwelling:  Section 121 allows you to apply the tax-
free treatment to the gain on an office located inside the walls  of the dwell -
ing unit. Thus, if one-third of your house is office space, you may apply 
one-third of the $250,000 or $500,000 exclusion to the home office profits.
 
Example:  The office, which you have claimed as a deduction for each 
of the past 10 years, takes up one-third of your dwelling. You and your 
spouse sell this home for a $300,000 profit (ignoring depreciation recap -
ture). You and your spouse may use the Section 121 exclusion to
l make $200,000 of the home sale profit tax-free, and
l make $100,000 of the personal office profit tax-free.
In this case, all your profit from appreciation is tax-free. 
 79NotesNext, you must consider the depreciation-recapture tax (generally 25 
percent) on the depreciation that you claimed on the office part of your 
home. No problem. Simply use the 1031 exchange to defer the recapture 
taxes.
Office outside the dwelling:  You may not apply Section 121 to any profit 
on the sale of an office that’s part of your home but located outside the 
walls of the dwelling unit.
Example:  For the past 10 years, you’ve had an office in the guesthouse, 
which is located on your property about 13 feet from the main house. You 
sell this property, including the guest house, for a $300,000 profit. The 
guest house makes up one-third of the property. You and your spouse
l may use the Section 121 exclusion to make $200,000 of the home sale 
profit tax-free, but
l may not use any of the Section 121 exclusion on the $100,000 of 
home office gain (ignoring, for the moment, depreciation).
To the rescue:  Don’t worry about that $100,000 profit. Under Revenue 
Procedure 2005-14, you can use the 1031 exchange to defer taxes on both 
l the taxable $100,000 profit from the sale of the guest house, and
l the depreciation recapture attributable to the guest house.
In summary, when you have a home office, inside or outside the dwelling, 
Revenue Procedure 2005-14 shows you
l How to use the 1031 exchange to defer the depreciation recapture tax 
(which applies to depreciation of the office part of your home claimed 
after May 6, 1997).1
l How to use Section 121 to make the gain on the office part of the 
home tax-free (assuming you meet the two-year test discussed below).
l How to use the 1031 exchange to defer taxes on the home office 
gain to which Section 121 does not apply (like the office in the guest 
house). 
Real-World Example of the Benefits
Revenue Procedure 2005-14 contains six examples. We are using the third 
example to illustrate the benefits of the combined strategy. 
Facts.  Say you bought your home in 2001 for $210,000. You have used 
one-third of the building as an office and the other two-thirds as a resi -
dence. Today, the home is worth $360,000 and carries $30,000 in deprecia -
tion subject to the recapture tax. 
80NotesOutcome:  By following these steps and using the 121 and 1031 combina -
tion, you will
l avoid the recapture tax on the $30,000, and 
l increase your basis in your new office by $50,000. 
Step 1:  You engage an exchange intermediary who charges about $750 to 
facilitate the exchange.
Step 2:  The exchange intermediary sells your existing home for $360,000.
Step 3:  You identify your replacement home, and the exchange intermedi -
ary buys it for $360,000. 
Refer to the exhibit below to see how you pay zero tax on the exchange of 
your old home for the replacement home: 
l Note the three columns for total, home, and office.
l Observe the first line, the replacement property line, which is the 
“amount realized” in this exchange.
l In the first gray area, look at the office column to see how deprecia -
tion reduces the basis of the office part of the home.
l In the second gray area, see how you apply $150,000 of the $250,000 
exclusion to eliminate  capital gains taxes on both the home and office.
l Also, see in the second gray area how the 1031 exchange takes care of 
depreciation recapture.
l Finally, go to the bottom of the exhibit and note that the gains subject 
to current-year taxation are ZERO.

 81NotesFour Rules That Make You Want to Kiss the IRS
Rule 1:  Revenue Procedure 2005-14 requires that you apply Section 121 
before applying Section 1031. Excellent! You get the tax-free part first. 
Rule 2:  You may not apply the $250,000 or $500,000 exclusions to any 
gain attributable to post-May 6, 1997, depreciation claimed on a home 
office, rental, or other commercial use of the home.2 No problem! You use 
the 1031 exchange to defer taxes on this part.3
Rule 3:  The cash you receive in the combined 121 and 1031 exchange is 
not taxable until it exceeds the gain you exclude under the $250,000 or 
$500,000 exclusions.4 Free cash is a very nice break.
Rule 4:  You increase the basis of your replacement property by the gain 
that Section 121 excludes on your relinquished property.5 Wow! First you 
exclude the gain from taxation; then you add this gain (on which you paid 
no taxes) to the cost basis of the replacement property and start depreciat -
ing it. 
Take a look at the exhibit at the bottom of this page. Look at the Office 
column. See how you add the $50,000 gain from the gain on which you 
paid no taxes to the $40,000 adjusted basis to get a new $90,000 basis in 
the replacement office. 
Let’s look at this $50,000 in a different light. Say you pay taxes at the fol -
lowing federal rates: 
l 15 percent on capital gains, and
l 31 percent on ordinary income.
Section 121 applies the exclusion to the $50,000 of capital gain attribut -
able to the office part of the sale. That saves you $7,500 in capital gains 
taxes. Next, you depreciate the $50,000. That saves you $15,500 in ordi -
nary income taxes. This little gift puts $23,000 in your pocket. That kind 
of savings makes you want to kiss the IRS.
Total Home Office
Adjusted basis of property relinquished (Exhibit 1) $180,000 $140,000 $40,000
Add gain from $250,000 exclusion 150,000 100,000 50,000
Adjusted basis of replacement property $330,000 $240,000 $90,000How to Find Basis in the Replacement Home 
82NotesYour savings may be more or less depending on 
l the ratio of land to building,
l your federal tax brackets, and
l your state brackets, and how the state treats capital gains.
Regardless, you will save big with this and the other breaks.
Convert Your Home to a Rental Property for More 
Happy Results 
Sally and Bill Smith bought a $420,000 house that they used as their prin -
cipal residence for 10 years, when they converted it to a rental property. 
After the conversion, the Smiths rented the house for 27 months, claimed 
$23,000 in depreciation, and then sold the house for $980,000 (using a 
1031 exchange intermediary to sell it). 
Within the proper 45- and 180-day periods laid out in the law, the ex -
change intermediary executed the sale of the rental house and used the 
proceeds to buy a $960,000 four-plex rental. This delayed exchange is of -
ten called a “Starker” exchange, after the taxpayer who won his court case, 
causing lawmakers to enact the delayed-exchange rules.6
Now that the exchange is complete, the Smiths have
l $20,000 in cash, and
l a $960,000 four-plex apartment building.
Revenue Procedure 2005-14 says the following:
l The Smiths may use the $500,000 exclusion on their old home, be -
cause in the Section 121 look-back period of five years, they used it as 
their principal residence for at least two years.
l The old home became a rental property and was a rental property at 
the time of the exchange.
l The $20,000 cash boot is not taxable because it is less than the 
$500,000 exclusion.

Tax knowledge helps the Smiths pay zero tax on the sale of their old home 
and pick up a four-plex rental as well. If they had preferred, they could 
have received up to $500,000 cash and still not paid any taxes, because 
they used the combined 121 and 1031 strategy. 
The basis of the four-plex after the exchange is as follows:
Adjusted basis of property 
  relinquished (the old home/rental) $397,000
Add Section 121 exclusion 500,000
Less cash received (20,000)
Adjusted basis of 
  replacement four-plex $877,000
Two things to note here: First, the $500,000 cut the taxes on the first 
exchange and then created another tax benefit by becoming part of the re -
placement property’s basis. Second, the $83,000 deferred by Section 1031 
is only that—deferred—thus, it does not add to the Smith’s basis in the 
replacement property. 
When the Smiths plan their disposition of the four-plex, the $83,000 is 
nowhere to be found. It reduced the basis of the replacement property. Of 
course, with good planning, the Smiths can again avoid taxes on the sale, 
exchange, or other disposition of the four-plex. 
Summary
When it’s time to get rid of your home, you may want to do a little plan -
ning to make sure your tax bite disappears. The first step, of course, is to 
know what the tax bite is now . Note that this rental is 
during the 5-year period and 
after use as the principal 
residence in compliance with 
Section 121(b)(4)(C)(ii)(I).
84NotesRevenue Procedure 2005-14 is powerful stuff. It illustrates how the use of 
Sections 121 and 1031 can produce spectacular results in which you 
l avoid taxes on the sale of your home,
l avoid taxes on the sale of the home office part,
l avoid taxes on the sale of the rental part, 
l avoid taxes on the exchange of a home that you converted to a rental 
property, and
l defer taxes on the depreciation recapture part. 
To get the tax-favored treatment, you simply engage an intermediary, who 
may charge you a fee of $750 or so, to become
l the substitute seller of your existing home, and 
l the substitute buyer of your replacement home.
Finally, you have to really like the part where the tax-free profit becomes 
part of the basis of the replacement property. That’s impressive!

Profit on Sale of Home with 
Office Sheltered by Exclusions
Happy Holidays:  A few years ago on Christmas eve, the IRS issued its new 
rules on sales of home offices.1 Like a holiday gift that you really like, you are 
going to be most pleased with these new rules.
Retroactive:  You may apply the new rules retroactively to amend any of your 
open tax years.2 Generally, your tax return is open for three years from the 
day you send it to the IRS.
Overall rule:  You may sell your main home for a profit of up to $250,000 
($500,000 if you file jointly) without owing a nickel to the IRS. This is a ma -
jor tax-saving break for individuals. To cash in, you must:3
l own the property for at least two years out of the five years ending on the 
date of sale, and
l use it as your principal home for at least two years during this five-year 
period.
Husband and wife:  For a husband and wife to qualify for the $500,000 exclu -
sion, both must meet the use test, but only one has to meet the ownership 
test.4
Only once every two years:  If you excluded the gain from an earlier home 
sale, you generally must wait two years before again taking advantage of the 
gain exclusion.5
The holiday present:  Under the new rules, if you sell a home that contained 
an office inside the dwelling, you do not make any allocation of appreciation 
to the office part of your home.6 You may have some depreciation recapture 
tax (very minor), as we will discuss later. But with an office inside the dwelling, 
you treat the appreciation on the sale of the home as if no office exists. Wow!
Example:  Harry Miller bought his home 17 years ago for $65,000. He used 
21 percent of his home as an office and deducted that office on his tax re -
turn every year. After making no improvements to the home for 17 years, 
Harry sells his home for $565,000. The Millers need not allocate any of the 
$500,000 to the office. Therefore, when Harry files jointly with his wife, they 
may exclude the entire $500,000 profit from taxation.
Thank the new rules:  Before the new rules, Harry and his wife would have 
paid capital gains taxes on $105,000 of the appreciation (the 21 percent office 
part of the $500,000 gain).
86NotesAmended return:  If Harry and his wife paid home office taxes on the 
$105,000 during any of the last three tax years, they may amend those returns 
and get a refund of the taxes paid.7
Tax on depreciation:  Although you may exclude the appreciation from taxa -
tion, you may not exclude home office depreciation taken after May 6, 1997.8 
This is no big deal because
l the capital gains tax rate on this recaptured depreciation is only 25 per -
cent (far less than the benefit rate), and
l you do not pay the 25 percent recapture tax until you sell the home (thus, 
you benefit by the time value of money).
Example:  Betty Bestor is in the 43 percent tax bracket. She claims $1,000 
in home-office depreciation and that puts $430 in her pocket. She takes this 
money and invests it at 5 percent, after taxes. In 10 years, when Betty sells 
her home, the original $430 has grown to $700. The sale of her home causes 
Betty to pay $250 in depreciation recapture taxes (25 percent x $1,000 original 
deduction). This is a good deal: pocket $700, pay $250, and make a profit of 
$450. 
Office outside the house:  If the office is not inside the house, you do not get 
the big appreciation break. Instead, you must pay taxes on the appreciation 
profits that you allocate to the office.9
Example:  You have your office in a detached garage. Your condition is identi -
cal to Harry’s above, except that your office is not inside the house. You owe 
tax on the $105,000 of gain that the law allocates to the office in your de -
tached garage.10
Planning tip for the detached office:  Eliminate the detached office and make 
it part of your home two years before sale of your home! This way you pass 
the two-out-of-five years test for exclusion of gain.
Example:  You eliminate the detached office and make it part of your home 
two years before you sell. When you sell, the entire $500,000 profit qualifies 
for exclusion and you pay no taxes on the appreciation of your home.
  1. The IRS made its final regulations on the sale of a 
home with an office effective on December 24, 2002. 
The new regulations replace the proposed regulations 
that were issued in October of 2000. Treasury Deci -

 87Notes Section 15
Install a Section 105 Medical 
Plan Now
Because you are self-employed, Uncle Sam allows you to deduct 100 
percent of your health insurance on your 1040. On the surface, this sounds 
like a great deal; after all, 100 percent is the WHOLE thing. But this 100 
percent is sneaky. It does not produce like a 100 percent business deduc -
tion.
First, even if you qualify for the 100 percent, and health insurance is your 
only medical cost for the entire year, you win more cash with a Section 
105 medical plan. Why? The Section 105 medical plan produces business 
deductions, whereas the 100 percent insurance deduction produces only a 
personal deduction on your Form 1040.
Second, you may not qualify for the 100 percent self-employed medical de -
duction. The 100 percent is not available to everyone. If either you or your 
spouse gets health insurance from an employer plan, you do not qualify 
for the 100 percent self-employed insurance deduction. 
Third, without a Section 105 plan, you claim much of your medical on 
your personal return as an itemized deduction. Here you get crushed 
twice. First, the adjusted gross income (AGI) floor jumps up and takes a 
big bite out of your deductions. Second, the surviving deductions produce 
tax benefits only at your lowly personal rate.
This section shows how you win with the Section 105 medical plan and 
the steps you must take to put the plan in place. 
How the Section 105 Plan Puts Money in Your 
Pocket
Example 1:  You are self employed and your spouse is not an employee 
of another company. Say that your family medical is $6,000 each year 
for health insurance and $4,000 for deductibles, co-pays, eyeglasses, 
braces for Sally, prescription drugs, and mileage to and from the doctor. 
Say further that the 10 percent floor on itemized medical destroys your 
$4,000 deduction. In this situation, your tax benefit from the 100 percent 
self-employed health insurance deduction is $1,500 in your 25 percent 
federal tax bracket. You avoid the AGI floor with a 
105 plan. If you have two or more 
employees in your business, 
Obamacare complicates, and 
perhaps does away with, your 
Section 105 medical plan. 
See the updates page at 
www.bradfordandcompany.
com/2017 for details and 
solutions.
88NotesWith a self-employed plan, you deduct the entire $10,000 as a business 
expense at your business tax rate, say 40.3 percent (15.3 percent self-em -
ployment tax plus the 25 percent income tax). Your tax benefit is $4,030.
You win by $2,530 ($4,030 minus $1,500) with the Section 105 medi -
cal plan. Keep in mind that the winnings come from money you already 
spend, and would spend regardless of how you deduct it. In other words, 
the Section 105 plan produces a $2,530 windfall simply for knowing what 
to do. You might save more. 
Example 2:  Employer plan involved. Say your situation is as above, but 
that you get your health insurance through an employer plan, either your 
employment or your spouse’s employment, or even prior employment if 
you or your spouse is retired. In this case, you do not qualify for the self-
employed insurance deduction. Thus, the entire $10,000 in medical shows 
up on your Schedule A as an itemized deduction subject to the 10 percent 
adjusted gross income floor. Let’s say further that the floor eats your de -
ductions and you get no benefit from your medical as an itemized deduc -
tion. (Yikes!)
Here comes the Section 105 medical plan to the rescue. With the plan, you 
deduct on your Schedule C all the medical as a business expense. At your 
benefit rate of 40.3 percent, you pocket $4,030—that’s $4,030 more than 
you pocketed without the Section 105 plan.
Your actual circumstances may produce larger or smaller benefits, but one 
thing is for sure: You pocket more money with a Section 105 medical plan.
What is a Section 105 medical plan?
Medical as compensation:  The law says that you may deduct all the ordi -
nary and necessary expenses to carry on your business, including a reason -
able allowance for salaries and other compensation for personal services.1 
The regulations expand on “other compensation” to include2 
l sickness, 
l accidents, 
l hospitalization, and 
l medical expenses.
Tax-free fringe benefit:  Section 105 makes the benefits of employer-
provided health care a tax-free fringe benefit to the employee. The care 
that qualifies for this tax-free treatment may be for the employee, the 
employee’s spouse, and the employee’s dependents. Further, qualifying 
care is any care or treatment otherwise deductible as an itemized deduc -
tion and includes the diagnosis, care, mitigation, treatment, or prevention 
of disease, or treatment affecting a structure or function of the body.3 It 
includes both transportation costs and the costs of insurance.
 89NotesSpectacular results:  What makes the medical reimbursement plan spec -
tacular is the tax deduction for the business, combined with the tax-free 
benefits to the employee. 
Example:  Say that you are the owner of the business and your spouse 
is your only employee. You cover your spouse with a Section 105 family 
medical reimbursement plan. Here’s the result:
l You, the employer, deduct the medical.
l Your employee-spouse obtains the medical as tax-free fringe benefits.
You deduct the cost. Your spouse has no taxable income from the medical 
reimbursement. You cannot find a better tax shelter.
Your Spouse as an Employee
The IRS says that the cost of health coverage is deductible by the employ -
er-spouse if she provides it to her employee-spouse.4 Further, the employ -
ee-spouse may exclude from his gross income both the cost of the health 
insurance coverage and the medical reimbursements.5
The employer may provide health coverage for not only the employee, but 
also the employee’s spouse and dependents. With this family plan, you 
(the employer-spouse) obtain coverage as the employee’s spouse.
For Employees Only
For purposes of the Section 105 medical plan, you, the self-employed indi -
vidual, are not an employee.6 To get around this problem, 
l the married individual hires her spouse, and 
l the single person either creates a C corporation or makes an arrange -
ment with another self-employed person.
With an arrangement, the single person has a friend hire her and cover her 
with a medical plan. In turn, the single person hires the friend and covers 
her with a medical plan. 
Three Great Things for Husbands and Wives to 
Know
1. No W-2 required for the family plan:  The IRS does not require a W-2 
to evidence employment of the spouse.7 
2. Medical as sole remuneration:  The IRS recognizes that often in Sec -
tion 105 plans involving husbands and wives, the sole remuneration to the 
employee-spouse is the cost of the medical coverage.8

 91Notes3. Spouse medical approved:  The IRS’s position is that the cost of the 
Section 105 medical plan covering the employee-spouse is deductible by 
the employer-spouse.9
Bad News for S Corporations and Partnerships
The spouse of a more-than-2 percent owner of an S corporation or a part -
nership is treated as a more-than-2 percent owner; therefore, that spouse is 
not eligible for the Section 105 medical plan. In effect, this rule considers 
the spouse the same as the owner by attributing the owner-spouse’s own -
ership to the employee-spouse.10 Therefore, the Section 105 plan strategy 
does not work for husband-and-wife partnerships and S corporations. 
Hot Issues with the IRS
Hot issue 1—Employee status:  The hottest issue with the IRS is the bona 
fide employment of the spouse. If the employee-spouse is not a bona fide 
employee, the health coverage is a personal expense. Here are three tips on 
how to help ensure employee status:
Tip—No employment contract:  Do not use an employment contract to 
prove employment status. The IRS does not believe the employment con -
tract and finds it a useful tool to prove that employee status is lacking. Of -
ten, the husband-and-wife team violates the terms of their written employ -
ment contract, allowing the IRS to make unkind and damaging assertions. 
Tip—Require a time sheet:  Require the employee-spouse to submit a 
weekly time sheet showing the work completed. Time sheets are great 
evidence.
Tip—Maintain corroborative evidence:  Do not destroy corroborative 
evidence. If your spouse typed letters or created a newsletter, you have 
corroborative evidence when you keep copies of the correspondence and 
newsletters. You might print this evidence and put it in a box, simply keep -
ing it in case you ever need it. 
Planning note:  We used to be really hot on the W-2 as proof. But the fact 
that the IRS does not give weight to a W-2 makes us relax this belief and 
recommend that you make your record-keeping life easier. From a proof 
standpoint, the W-2 is excellent proof that you intended your spouse to 
be an employee. But the W-2 only helps with intent—the real proof is the 
time sheet. Besides, doing a payroll is a pain in the neck, and it’s expensive 
and time-consuming.

** An individual taxpayer may not deduct over-the-counter drugs; however, the Section 105 medical plans may reimburse prescribed 
over-the-counter drugs and claim deductions for the reimbursements. See Bonus 2 that follows for more information.
 93NotesAnyway, the W-2 itself proves nothing. The time sheet proves the work. 
Make absolutely, positively sure that you have the time-sheet evidence in 
good order. 
Hot issue 2—The insurance policy:  The IRS says that if the insurance 
policy is in the name of the employer-spouse, then the taxpayer-spouse 
must claim the insurance deductions as a self-employed insurance deduc -
tion, and not as an employee welfare benefit for her employee spouse. 
Obviously, this undesirable classification cuts into your cash benefit.
Tip—Buy in employee’s name:  If possible and easy, buy the insurance in 
your employee-spouse’s name.
Tip—Buy in your name to save money:  If you save money because the 
policy is in your name, get ready to fight the IRS. But keep in mind that 
you only have to fight if
1. you get audited, and
2. the IRS brings up the insurance as an issue.
Let’s assume that’s the case and you are up for the fight. The IRS has no 
basis for attacking the insurance. It is not in a ruling, a law, or a regulation. 
It is not part of any legislative history. This is simply the IRS’s wish. You 
can easily argue for your position. 
Saving money is a big hammer:  You have a good argument when 
you save money. The fact that you can buy insurance that covers your 
employee-spouse and his family cheaper because the insurance is in your 
name carries great weight. Actually, both the courts and the IRS favor the 
“saving money” issues. 
Hot issue 3—Retroactive start date:  In Revenue Ruling 2002-58, the IRS 
ruled that the start date of the plan may not precede the date the plan is es -
tablished. For example, if the plan is established on December 1, the plan 
may not start retroactively on January 1 of the same year.
Tip—Start today:  Establish the plan as early in the year as possible. In any 
event, don’t procrastinate. Make sure you have your plan in place today.

94NotesSample Plan Adoption Agreement and Description
Medical Expense Reimbursement Plan for (name of business or, if no separate business 
name, your name as shown on your tax return)
This sample plan adoption agreement is for coverage of one-employee only and applies to tax years begin -
ning January 1, 2014 and later. Under 2014 law, with more than one eligible employee, your health re -
imbursement plan must include group health coverage, but with one eligible employee only, the plan may 
avoid “group health coverage” and reimburse all qualified medical expenses, including the cost of health 
insurance purchased by the employee.
1. PURPOSE:  The purpose of the plan is complete and 
full medical care for one eligible employee of (name of 
business). The plan is designed and intended to qualify 
as an accident and health plan within the meaning of 
Section 105 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended, and to comply with the requirements of IRS 
Notice 2013-54 as a qualified Health Reimbursement 
Account under the Affordable Care Act. The Section 
105 plan allows the employee to exclude the medical 
benefits of this plan from his or her gross income.
2. EFFECTIVE DATE:  The effective date of this plan 
is ________ and it operates on a calendar-year basis 
hereafter. The plan year is the same as the tax year of 
this business and, like the records of the business; the 
records of the plan shall be kept on a calendar-year 
basis.
3. ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE:  Because this plan does 
not include group health insurance, it is a one-employ -
ee plan. All full- and part-time employees of (name of 
business) may participate in this plan, but should the 
plan cover more than one eligible employee, then the 
plan will be amended to purchase qualified Affordable 
Care Act “group health coverage” as a component of 
the plan.
4. BENEFITS:  Within 15 days of reimbursement 
requests, (name of business) shall reimburse the em -
ployee for expenses incurred for the medical care of 
the employee, the employee’s spouse, the employee’s 
dependents, and any child of the employee who, as of 
the end of the taxable year, has not attained age 27. The 
plan covers only qualified medical expenses incurred 
by the employee on or after the date of hire.
“Medical care” for the Section 105 plan is defined in 
Section 213(d), which is the section that authorizes itemized deductions. Thus, the employee may submit 
for reimbursement any expense incurred that would 
otherwise qualify as an itemized medical expense 
deduction on Schedule A of IRS Form 1040. (See IRS 
Publication 502, Medical and Dental Expenses , for a 
list of qualifying expenses.) In addition, the employee 
may submit for reimbursement the costs incurred for 
“prescribed” over-the-counter drugs and medicines 
used to treat illness or injury.
“Dependents” for Section 105 are defined in Section 
152, determined without regard to Subsections (b)(1), 
(b)(2), and (d)(1)(B). In general, this means the depen -
dents you claim on your tax return. In addition, this 
means that an individual could be your dependent for 
the Section 105 plan even though the individual is not 
your dependent for your Form 1040 because
the individual is a dependent of another •	
taxpayer—Section 152(b)(1);
the individual is married and files a joint tax •	
return—Section 152(b)(2); or
the individual has gross income equal to or •	
above the exemption amount—Section 152(d)
(1)(B).
“Child” is defined in Section 152(f)(1) to include the 
employee’s son, daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, eli -
gible foster child, or legally (or placed) adopted child. 
The term “eligible foster child” means an individual 
who is placed with the employee by an authorized 
placement agency or by judgment, decree, or other 
order of any court of competent jurisdiction.
Any child of divorced parents to whom Section 152(e) 
applies shall be treated as a dependent of both parents 
for purposes of Section 105.

benefits. Most businesses do not want to leave them -
selves open to unlimited liability.)6. SUBMISSION OF EXPENSES:  The eligible em -
ployee must submit claims for reimbursement not less 
than annually. The employee is encouraged to submit 
claims more frequently. The employee must submit 
claims that clearly show that the employee or his or her 
dependent incurred a valid medical expense. The em -
ployee need not have paid the claim for the employer 
to reimburse such claim, but the evidence must clearly 
show that the employee is liable for the expenses.
7. ADMINISTRATION:  (Name of business) has 
both the authority and the responsibility to control and 
manage plan operations and administration. (Name of 
business) shall keep a copy of this plan document at the 
office of the business, where employees or participants 
may inspect and review it during (name of business) 
regular business hours. Also, should any employee or 
covered dependent desire a copy of the plan, (name of 
business) shall provide such copy within a reasonable 
time of the request.
8. AMENDMENT AND DISCONTINUATION:  
(Name of business) may amend this document at any 
time. Any amendment may not retroactively preclude 
any reimbursement. Similarly, (name of business) may 
terminate this plan anytime, but any such termination 
may not retroactively preclude benefits.
9. NOTIFICATION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT: 
(Name of business) shall promptly notify all eligible 
employees that this plan is available and give such 
employees a copy of the plan for their review. Eligible 
employees shall acknowledge acceptance or rejection 
of the plan with a signature, as set forth below.
96Noteslow the employer deduction for health insurance.11 Watch how this business 
deduction  far exceeds the long-term care deduction for the self-employed or 
individual taxpayer.
Pitiful deduction:  First, the law puts a cap on the self-employed health 
insurance and personal deductions for long-term care insurance. For 
example, the taxpayer, age 51 to 60, may deduct only $1,230 in long-term 
care premiums.12 If this taxpayer pays $5,000 for long-term care insurance, 
his self-employed medical insurance deduction gets whacked two times. 
l First, he loses $3,770 in deductions to the $1,230 ceiling.
l Second, the $1,230 ceiling deduction goes on the front of the Form 
1040, where it reduces only his income tax.
Compare this with a Section 105 plan:  Watch how this shakes out for the 
Schedule C taxpayer in the 25 percent income tax bracket:
l The after-tax cash benefit for the $5,000 as a Section 105 deduction is 
$2,015 a year (40.3 percent x $5,000).
l The after-tax cash benefit for the $1,230 self-employed medical 
insurance deduction that shows up on the front of the IRS Form 1040 
is only $308 (25 percent x $1,230).
This is impressive!  The $2,015 Section 105 plan benefit is 654 percent 
more valuable than the benefit from the long-term care insurance deduc -
tion on the front of IRS Form 1040. 
You might get more benefit.  This assumes a self-employed insurance 
deduction for the long-term care insurance, which might not happen. Two 
rules could destroy the insurance deduction. 
l Rule 1: You may not claim the self-employed health insurance deduc -
tion for insurance obtained through another employer either by you or 
your spouse.
l Rule 2: If you get slammed by Rule 1, the long-term insurance cost 
goes on your Schedule A as an itemized deduction, where it often gets 
obliterated by the 10 percent floor.
Bonus 2. New health care law continues to allow select over-the-
counter drugs
Health care reform enacted on March 23, 2010 revised the definition of 
what the Section 105 medical plan could reimburse for over-the-counter 
drugs.13 
The New Prescription Requirement
For expenses incurred after December 31, 2010, the Section 105 medical 
reimbursement plan may reimburse a medicine or a drug only if Continued from Pg. 93
 97Notesthe medicine or drug requires a prescription;1. 
is available without a prescription (an over-the-counter medicine or 2. 
drug) and the individual obtains a prescription; or
 is insulin.3. 
A “prescription “ means a written or electronic order for a medicine or 
drug that meets the legal requirements of a prescription in the state in 
which the medical expense is incurred and that is issued by an individual 
who is legally authorized to issue a prescription in that state. 
Other Over-the-Counter Expenses
The new prescription rules apply to medicines and drugs. They do not ap -
ply to 
equipment (such as crutches),  l
supplies (such as bandages), and  l
diagnostic devices (such as blood sugar test kits). l
Crutches, bandages, and test kits continue to qualify as Section 105 re -
imbursable medical care if they otherwise meet the definition of medical 
care in Section 213(d)(1), which includes expenses for the diagnosis, cure, 
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of af -
fecting any structure or function of the body.
Planning note.  With or without a prescription, the individual taxpayer 
may not deduct any over the counter drugs on his or her Form 1040, 
Schedule A. Thus, the Section 105 plan adds another benefit with the 
allowance of prescribed over-the-counter drugs, such as allergy medicines. 
How the IRS Looks at Total Compensation
In paragraph 8 of its settlement guidelines, the IRS recognizes that total 
compensation includes cash wages plus the cost of the medical plan. The 
courts also view total compensation as all remuneration, whether as tax -
able or nontaxable fringe benefits, deferred or nondeferred compensation, 
or other means.14
Example 1:  Say you pay your employee-spouse $1,080 in cash wages and 
give her a 100 percent medical reimbursement plan that costs you $11,514. 
Total pay for reasonable compensation purposes is $12,594 ($1,080 plus 
$11,514). With 500 hours of work, you paid $25.19 an hour for reasonable 
compensation purposes, but only $1,080 subject to FICA and Medicare 
taxes.
98NotesExample 2:  You pay your employee-spouse zero cash wages and cover 
your spouse with a Section 105 plan that provides him with an $11,514 
tax-free medical reimbursement for the year. You paid $11,514 for reason -
able compensation purposes, none of which is subject to any payroll taxes. 
Tips for Making Your 100 percent Medical 
Reimbursement Plan Stand Up to the IRS
The IRS requires that you put your medical reimbursement plan in 
writing.15 Use the sample plan in this section as a guide. Make sure to 
personalize it. 
A plan that covers only the owner and his or her family is not subject to 
ERISA. But once you add an outside employee, you trigger both ERISA 
and discrimination rules that require a written instrument for the medical 
reimbursement plan.16 
Prepare your written plan today.
The sample plan in this section of your reference book meets the ERISA 
requirement for a written “summary plan description.” You must write the 
summary plan description so that the average plan participant can reason -
ably understand his rights and obligations.17 Further, you must give every 
participant (even your employee-spouse) a summary plan document.18
Reimburse medical expenses monthly: From your separate business check -
ing account, reimburse employee-submitted expenses monthly. If possible, 
reimburse your employee-spouse for every medical expense, so you have a 
clean audit trail for the medical expenses. To make this work, you need:
l A separate business checking account
l Payment of medical expenses and insurance from personal accounts
The reason you want this scenario is that your medical plan is a “reim -
bursement” plan. You need expenses and someone to reimburse.
Obviously, you could have some payments made directly from the busi -
ness to the vendors. Further, your spouse may have a medical insurance 
plan with another employer for which you reimburse him or her based on 
pay stubs that show amounts withheld to cover the employee’s payment 
for insurance. No problem! Reimburse based on the dollars taken from the 
paycheck. Keep the pay stub as evidence.
 99NotesWhat You Can Do When You Have Other 
Employees
Discrimination allowed:  If you expect to hire other employees after you 
hire your spouse, you can use the tax law’s Section 105 allowable discrimi -
nation rules to exclude from the medical reimbursement plan:
l Employees who do not have 3 years of service
l Employees not yet age 25 on the first day of the plan year
Making discrimination work: To make this discrimination work for 
you, you must apply the discrimination rules after you hire your spouse or 
friend. The Afforable Care Act 
impacted what you need to 
do with a Section 105 plan 
if you want to cover employ-
ees other than your spouse.

Section 16
Court Case Shows How a Wife’s 
Business Covers the Husband 
with a Section 105 Medical Plan
Thank the court for a case study on how to implement a husband-and-wife  
Section 105 plan. In this section, we will show you how the Section 105 
plan works for the sole proprietor who has only one employee, her hus -
band. 
Mrs. Speltz hired Mr. Speltz to work part-time in her day-care business. 
Mr. Speltz already had a full-time job and a couple of side businesses. 
Mrs. Speltz paid Mr. Speltz no cash wages. Instead, she set the wage equal 
to the Section 105 medical plan reimbursement.
Planning tip: With the Section 105 plan in lieu of cash wages, Mrs. Speltz 
saved the considerable time and trouble involved in a payroll.
In court, the IRS said that Mrs. Speltz, the sole proprietor, could not 
deduct $7,818 in Section 105 medical reimbursements for the two years at 
issue before the court because1
l	the Section 105 plan she put together was improper;
l	the Section 105 plan failed on its own terms;
l	Mr. Speltz was not a bona fide employee of the business;
l	the medical reimbursements were not ordinary and necessary business 
expenses;
l	the medical reimbursements were not reasonable based on the hours 
worked and the work performed; and 
l	if all of these arguments failed with the court, then the insurance 
part of the reimbursement was improper because it was deductible 
as a self-employed expense on the front of the Form 1040, not as a 
Schedule C business expense.
102NotesYou have to admire the IRS’s laundry list of assertions. Most people 
would have been intimidated. Not Mrs. Speltz. She is a tough lady. She  
beat the IRS like a rug on every IRS argument, winning her Section 105 
medical reimbursement plan deductions in total.  
She Put the Plan in Writing
With the help of her tax advisor, Mrs. Speltz used the IRS’s Coordinated 
Issue Paper “Health Insurance Deductibility for Self-Employed Individu -
als” as a guide to putting together 
l	an employment contract, 
l	a salary redirection document, and 
l	a client data sheet. 
The medical plan was embedded in these documents.
IRS regulation 1.105-5(a) states that the medical reimbursement plan need 
not be in writing, but the participant must know and have knowledge of 
the plan. In this case, the IRS argued 
l	that there was no proper plan under Section 105; and
l	that, if the court deemed the plan proper, then Mr. Speltz did not have 
proper notice of the plan.
Realize that the IRS was making this argument in court. When Mrs. 
Speltz decided on the medical plan, she had a written client data sheet 
from her tax advisor stating that the medical plan would start in March 
and that employees (her husband was the only employee) were eligible for 
reimbursements of up to $6,500 a year for medical expenses and insur -
ance. Mrs. Speltz also had an employment contract, signed by Mr. Speltz, 
which stated his salary would be in the form of medical reimbursements. 
He would see no cash.
The court ruled that Mrs. Speltz’s proprietorship did indeed have a Section 
105 plan and Mr. Speltz certainly had notice of the plan as evidenced by 
his employment agreement, testimony before the court, and his use of the 
plan.
Planning tip:  A written Section 105 plan would have avoided this trouble. 
Put your plan in writing. Make sure your spouse acknowledges the con -
tents of the plan by signing the plan document. Then, have your spouse 
turn in the medical expenses on a monthly basis, as this makes the plan 
more businesslike. The preceding section contains a sample plan that you 
can adapt for your business.
 103NotesForget the Employment Contract—Require a 
Time Sheet
Mr. Speltz signed an employment contract that required him to 
l	complete specific business chores,
l	work a minimum of 12.5 hours a week, and
l	work a minimum of seven months a year.
The IRS argued that Mr. Speltz did not work a minimum of 12.5 hours 
each and every week. The court ignored the 12.5-hour minimum because 
it conflicted with the seven-month requirement. In other words, if the 
intent was a minimum of 12.5 hours a week, why put in the seven-month 
requirement? Based on this analysis, the court ruled that Mr. Speltz abided 
by the terms of his employment contract. 
The employment contract gave rise to a second argument by the IRS: the 
contract required duties that were personal chores, such as grocery shop -
ping. The court agreed and, as part of this proceeding, Mrs. Speltz sub -
tracted the time required for the personal chores from the business time.
Planning tip.  Forget the employment contract. This agreement is often a 
disaster for husband-and-wife employment. In this case, as in many cases, 
the employment contract created hurdles for the IRS, the court, and the 
Speltzes. Further, you sign the employment contract today; but times 
change and businesses change. Changes invariably result in both you and 
the employee violating the agreement. 
Sure, you could update the contract periodically. Will you do that? Maybe, 
but probably not! Why take a chance? Forget the employment contract. 
Even when the contract is perfect, it does not amount to much in your 
arsenal of proof. 
Ensuring the Employee–Employer Relationship
The IRS argued that Mr. Speltz was not a bona fide employee. The court 
disagreed and gave a number of reasons why Mr. Speltz was a bona fide 
employee:
l	Mrs. Speltz controlled and directed Mr. Speltz’s work efforts.
l	Mr. Speltz worked for the day-care center on a consistent basis, as 
evidenced by his testimony and the entries in Mrs. Speltz’s calendar 
notations.
l	Mr. Speltz’s work was legitimate work that contributed to the success 
of the business.
l	Mr. Speltz obtained the six hours of required training needed to work 
in Mrs. Speltz’s day-care business.
l	Mr. Speltz did the work.
104NotesThe court noted that many cases like the Speltz case fail the legitimate em -
ployee test because the taxpayer fails to prove that the employee provided 
the services. In this case, the court found the testimony concerning the 
work credible. The court also liked Mrs. Speltz’s notes on the calendar that 
showed the work done by Mr. Speltz. 
Going to court is a pain. Mrs. Speltz was lucky that the court liked her 
notes showing the work done by Mr. Speltz. 
A good time sheet provides far better proof than notes on a calendar. 
Quite possibly, the existence of a properly kept time sheet would have kept 
the Speltzes out of court. 
A good time sheet
l	is signed by the employee,
l	is turned in on a weekly basis, 
		lshows the hours worked on a daily basis, and
		ldescribes the work performed.
Planning tip.  Do not create expectations with an employment agreement. 
Instead, use the time sheet as the proof of valid employment where actual 
work gets done. Avoid the employment agreement. It simply gives you 
something to violate.
Keep another thing in mind when it comes to proof. The time sheet is your 
employee-spouse’s written statement that the work was done. Making this 
statement in writing on a weekly basis meets the timely recording require -
ment that permeates tax law . 
How do you prove that your spouse is not cheating on the time sheet? 
Your spouse could, for example, simply enter the time and not do the 
work. How would the IRS know? 
First, take our word; the IRS knows. Auditors learn how to identify cheat -
ing. The first clue the auditor sees is no corroborative evidence. For ex -
ample, your spouse says he is helping with the advertising, but not one of 
the invoices or other advertising documents bears any notes, directions, or 
annotations by your spouse. This might indicate that your spouse did not 
help with the advertising. 
When deciding on your tax evidence, be honest and try to think like an 
auditor. 
 105NotesThe Section 105 Plan Is a Proper Business 
Expense
At the Speltz trial, the IRS asserted that the medical payments were per -
sonal—and not business—expenses. The IRS noted that taxpayers may 
not deduct personal, family, or living expenses. 
The IRS noted for the court that Mr. Speltz picked up the mail and gro -
ceries and did other personal chores that Mrs. Speltz counted as business 
chores. 
The court recognized the IRS arguments but found that Mr. Speltz did 
enough business chores to qualify as an employee. 
Next, the court addressed the issue of compensation, which was in the 
form of medical reimbursement only. Here the court noted that Section 
162 allows tax deductions for employee compensation and that such com -
pensation includes payments for sickness, hospitalization, and medical 
expenses. Based on this review of the law,  the court ruled that Mr. Speltz 
was an employee who was properly compensated for his work effort by 
reimbursement of medical expenses. 
Planning tip:  The IRS did not contest that the medical plan could be a 
business expense. The primary reason that the IRS had for saying that 
the medical expenses were personal involved the fact that Mr. Speltz did 
personal chores, and that, by association, made the medical payments 
personal expenses. Had there been no employment agreement and had 
Mr. Speltz kept a time sheet where he recorded only business chores, this 
discussion would not have taken place in court. 
Mrs. Speltz Paid Mr. Speltz a Reasonable Amount 
for His Work 
Remember, Mr. Speltz received no cash wages. He was paid solely with 
medical reimbursements under the Section 105 plan.
The IRS asserted that the amounts paid to Mr. Speltz were unreasonable. 
The court noted that reasonable compensation is based on facts and cir -
cumstances and not on fixed rules or exact standards.
The court divided the medical reimbursement amounts by the hours 
worked and came up with an equivalent wage of about $6.50 an hour. The 
court thought this rate comparatively low, considering that Mrs. Speltz 
would have to pay a third party $13 an hour. 
106NotesThen the court did a second computation. This time the court said that if 
half of the hours logged by Mr. Speltz were not business hours, but were 
instead devoted to personal chores, then Mr. Speltz’s rate of pay would 
have been about $13 an hour—the amount Mrs. Speltz would have had to 
pay a third-party worker. 
Based on its two computations, the court ruled that the compensation paid 
by Mrs. Speltz to her husband was reasonable compensation.
Planning note.  When you see how much the Section 105 plan is worth 
per hour, try to think in terms of reasonable pay for the work done. If you 
are going to err, err on the side of underpaying for the work. But make it 
a point to document what a reasonable wage for the work would be, and 
then do your best to make the medical reimbursement match that docu -
mented reasonable wage.
Deduct Reimbursed Insurance as a Business 
Expense for Medical Reimbursement
Mr. Speltz worked as a full-time employee in addition to helping his wife. 
In his full-time job, he received medical insurance that covered him and 
his family. He paid about $1,000 a year to his employer for his part of the 
medical, dental, and cancer insurance premiums. 
The IRS asserted that Section 162(l) precluded Mrs. Speltz from deducting 
the insurance premiums, because this plan was subsidized by her spouse’s 
employer. The “no-employer-subsidy rule” applies to the self-employed 
individual who desires the self-employed insurance deduction on page 1 of 
IRS Form 1040. That’s not what Mrs. Speltz desired.
She wanted to deduct the medical reimbursement as a Schedule C busi -
ness expense of her sole proprietorship.  
The court noted that Mrs. Speltz was self-employed, but that she was not 
deducting the premiums as an individual self-employed person. Instead, 
she was deducting the premiums as an employer reimbursing an employee. 
Thus, ruled the court, Mrs. Speltz could deduct as a business expense on 
her Schedule C the insurance premiums taken from her husband’s W-2 
that she reimbursed her husband as part of her medical reimbursement 
plan for employees. 
The fact that the reimbursement to Mr. Speltz was for a family plan made 
no difference whatsoever. Mrs. Speltz was reimbursing an employee for al -
lowable employee medical benefits that, under law, allow for a family plan.
 107NotesSome Final Conclusions
Had Mrs. Speltz lost her Section 105 medical plan deductions, she would 
have lost her medical deductions altogether. Considering her day-care 
business and her husband’s employment, she did not qualify for the sole-
proprietorship deduction on the first page of Form 1040, and more than 
likely the 10 percent floor would have eaten any medical expenses she put 
on Schedule A of her Form 1040. 
When you consider her self-employment tax, her and her husband’s 
combined federal income tax, and her and her husband’s state income tax 
rates, the Speltzes realized about half of the $7,818 in deductions as cash 
savings. 
We assume that they have continued the Section 105 medical plan for the 
years since this encounter with the IRS. The medical plan is like an annu -
ity for Mr. and Mrs. Speltz. It pays them cash savings every year that they 
have this plan in Mrs. Speltz’s business. 
Mrs. Speltz won her case because she had basic knowledge of the rules 
and adequate documentation to prove that her husband was an employee. 
With just a little attention to some details, she could have avoided the trip 
to court. Don’t put yourself in her place. Follow these basics to protect 
yourself:
Put the plan in writing.1. 
Require the employee-spouse to keep a time sheet and submit that 2. 
time sheet to you every week.
If you have other employees, consider the cost of covering the other 3. 
employees. 
Pay a zero salary if this will turn out to be reasonable, so that medi - 4. 
cal reimbursement is the only remuneration to your employee-spouse. 
(This avoids payroll taxes.)
Make the medical reimbursements on a recurring basis, perhaps 5. 
monthly, so you don’t forget to make the reimbursements.
Finally, thank Mrs. Speltz for her tenacious pursuit of her medical deduc -
tions. Note how the IRS made a plethora of attacks against her medical 
reimbursement plan. Most people would have backed right down. Not 
Mrs. Speltz. She deserves accolades. 
However, try to avoid the route she took. A time sheet combined with a 
written Section 105 medical reimbursement plan will help make your plan 
stand up to the IRS and and help you avoid any trips to court.

Section 17
IRS Puts Screws to S 
Corporation Health Insurance
The S corporation owner always gets the short stick when it comes to 
health insurance. That stick just got a lot shorter and might even disappear 
for owners who don’t pay attention to this section of the course and take 
action.
First, let’s review why the S corporation is a lousy place for the owner’s 
health deductions. After this review, we’ll explain how the S corporation 
got even worse with this latest news from the IRS. Then we’ll list the steps 
you need to take to fix the problem now .
The Basic Rule
For purposes of fringe benefits, like health insurance, IRC Section 1372(a) 
treats the S corporation as a partnership and the more than 2 percent 
shareholders as partners. Revenue Ruling 91-26 holds that accident and 
health insurance premiums paid by a partnership to a partner as remu -
neration for services are guaranteed payments under Section 707(c); they 
are deducted by the partnership and should be included in the recipient-
partner’s W-2. 
IRC Section 162(l)(5) holds that a more than 2 percent shareholder treated 
as a partner is a self-employed person who may deduct health insurance 
premiums on the front of IRS form 1040 (creating an above-the-line 
deduction). (This works only when the S corporation pays the premiums 
directly to the insurance company or reimburses the employee for the 
premiums--and then reports these amounts as W-2 compensation to the 
more than 2 percent owner employee.)
Even When It Works, It’s Lousy 
Under the rules above, you have the health insurance as income from your 
S corporation and you can deduct the health insurance on your 1040. Let’s 
see why this health insurance deduction produces generally lousy results: 
The 1040 front-page deduction is not a business deduction; therefore,  l
it does not reduce self-employment taxes.
The 1040 front-page deduction is for health insurance only; therefore,  l
you claim your prescription drug costs and doctor visit co-pays as 
 109Notes
itemized deductions subject to the 10 percent adjusted gross income 
floor (which generally kills these deductions).
Claiming medical deductions under the rules above produces a poor tax 
result. 
Why Things Just Got Worse
The IRS recently posted a new position that could put your S corporation 
medical deductions in far worse shape than the lousy shape they’re already 
in. Let’s say you are a more than 2 percent S corporation shareholder who 
cannot find health insurance that you want to buy in the corporate name, 
so you buy health insurance in your own name. Your tax results change 
dramatically. With the health insurance in your own name, the IRS says 
that1
the S corporation does not give you medical insurance; l
since the S corporation is not buying the insurance, it does not give  l
you a fringe benefit;
without the fringe benefit from the S corporation, you receive no guar -  l
anteed payment; 
without the fringe benefit, you are not treated as a partner with respect  l
to the medical insurance; 
if you are not treated as a partner for the purpose of medical insur -  l
ance, you are not treated as self-employed for your personal purchase 
of medical coverage; and
you do not qualify for the front-of-the-form 1040 deduction; l
therefore, you have to deduct the health insurance as an itemized de -  l
duction, subject to the 10 percent adjusted gross income limit.
The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) submitted a proposed revenue 
ruling that it would like the IRS to issue concerning health insurance for 
the S corporation owner.2 This proposal would simply make the IRS’s po -
sition that we just described official. Thus, you need to plan your S corpo -
raton medical insurance if you want the best deductions.
110Notes
Planning You Need to Do
Choice 1: Eliminate the S corporation.  You achieve a far better result 
when you can deduct your entire medical costs as business expenses. 
This is a good time to evaluate the S corporation as your choice of entity. 
Spend a few minutes with the section of this course that helps you choose 
the right business entity for you. 
Proprietorship.  Say you could operate this business as a proprietorship 
with no employees other than your employee-spouse. In this situation, 
you could cover the employee-spouse with a Section 105 plan that would, 
in turn, produce business deductions for all the family medical expenses 
(insurance and otherwise). 
If you have this situation but you need liability protection, you can achieve 
both proprietorship treatment and liability protection with a single-mem -
ber LLC. Also, in a community property state, the husband-and-wife LLC 
can elect single-member LLC status.
C corporation.  The C corporation can cover its employees (even if you 
are the one and only employee) with a medical reimbursement plan and 
deduct all the medical reimbursements as business deductions.
Choice 2: Create a new plan in the S corporation.  If you are happy with 
the S corporation and would like to continue with the S corporation with -
out sacrificing the Form 1040 deduction for insurance, establish a medical 
insurance reimbursement plan at the S corporation level. You can make 
this plan pay the insurance premiums directly or require it to reimburse 
you and your spouse for premiums if you pay them individually. Your S 
corporation then includes the medical insurance payments made by the 
plan in your W-2 as guaranteed payments. This treatment is necessary to 
claim the insurance on the front of your Form 1040.
Action is necessary .  This new IRS position on the health insurance de -
duction for the S corporation shareholder should galvanize you to act. 
Don’t wait. Monies already spent could be in jeopardy, but action now can 
protect the money you are going to spend in the future. 
 111Notes
Summary
In summary, if the more than 2 percent owner-employee of an S corpora -
tion buys health insurance in his own name, 
he deducts the cost of insurance in that unfavorable personal itemized  l
deduction category on Schedule A of his personal 1040 tax return, 
unless
the corporation reimburses him via a Section 105 plan reimbursement  l
for the medical insurance, in which case the corporation reports the 
reimbursement as a self-employment taxable guaranteed payment to 
the owner. Because of the guaranteed payment, the owner can deduct 
the cost of the insurance on page 1 of his Form 1040, where it does 
not suffer any reduction from the 10 percent floor.
Thus, the best the S corporation can offer the owner-employee is a family 
medical insurance deduction on page 1 of the Form 1040 and personal 
itemized deductions for out-of-pocket expenses, co-payments, and other 
non-insurance covered expense. 
Both the C corporation and the proprietorship can create business expenses 
for the cost of all medical insurance and all out-of-pocket and other medi -
cal expenses generally considered itemized deductions. Big difference!

Pocket Self-Employment Taxes 
by Renting from Your Spouse
If you are single, consider forming an S corporation. Then, listen to the CDs (do this first always) and 
then read this section with the thought that this S corporation could be your “no-hassle spouse” (we see 
that smile!), possibly producing the same basic results that the married person gets in this section.
The IRS Market Segment Specialization Program Training Guide  tells IRS au -
ditors that they need to be aware of the Cox1 case, as it expands deductible 
spouse rentals to include those reported on joint tax returns. Before the 
Cox case, the IRS disallowed spouse rentals when joint returns were filed. 
The training manual directs the IRS’s field force to know that the court 
allowed a deduction for rent paid by one spouse to the other, even though 
they filed a joint tax return.2
In Cox, the court ruled that Sherman Cox could deduct the business rent 
he paid for his wife’s interest in their jointly owned office building. Thus, 
Mr. Cox could deduct this rent as a business expense on his Schedule C. 
Maxine Cox, his wife, reported the rental income on Schedule E of their 
jointly filed tax return. 
The deduction on Schedule C reduced Mr. Cox’s self-employment taxes. 
Rental income is not subject to the self-employment tax, so Mrs. Cox did 
not pay any self-employment taxes on the rental income. Presto! The Cox 
family put money in their pockets by reducing their self-employment taxes.
Save Up to 14.13 Percent
For 2017, the published self-employment tax is 15.3 percent of your 
Schedule C income of up to $127,200.3 Above this plateau, your self-em -
ployment tax drops to 2.9 percent (the Medicare part). 
However, the real self-employment tax is assessed on 92.35 percent of net 
earnings up to $137,737 which gives you the $127,200 maximum. This 
means that you can save at the effective rate of 14.13 percent on your first 
$137,737 of net 2017 self-employment income.
Note the subhead of this section: “Save Up to 14.13 Percent” which is 
your true rate. The “up to” part is because the savings in your self-employ -
ment tax reduce your page 1 deduction for one-half of your self-employ -
ment tax. We will show you the net dollars in an example below .
114NotesShort History of the Spouse Rental Deduction
In 1974, the IRS ruled that a Wisconsin man could deduct the rent he paid 
his wife in that community property state on his separately filed Form 
1040.4 This 1974 ruling updated a 1948 ruling.
In 1981, the IRS issued a private letter ruling to an individual, telling him 
that he could not deduct the rent he paid his wife because he and his wife 
did not file separately as did the couple in Wisconsin.5
In 1993, the Cox case nullified the joint return requirement. 
Today, things stand exactly as the IRS’s training guide points out to its 
agents and auditors. If you pay your spouse a bona fide rent for his or her 
separate ownership of property that you use in your business, you may 
deduct the rent regardless of how you file your tax return. 
Technique Does Not Increase Deductions for 
Passive Losses
As you are reading this, lightbulbs might be going off at the idea that you 
can count this spouse rental income as positive passive income. No dice. 
Lawmakers and the IRS saw you coming.
IRS Regulation 1.469-2(f)(6) recharacterizes rental income from an activ -
ity in which you materially participate as non-passive income. This is the 
self-rental rule. Further, regulations 1.469-5(f)(1) and 1.469-5T(f)(3) attri -
bute your spouse’s participation to you. 
The result here is simple. You may not use the passive income generated 
by paying rent to your spouse to increase your passive income and deduct 
more of your passive losses. Nevertheless, the self-employment savings 
may be more than enough to warrant serious consideration of this pay-
rent-to-your-spouse strategy. 
How You Pocket the Cash
Let’s say that your net earnings from your Schedule C business are 
$105,576. Now you pay your spouse $20,000 in rent for your office space. 
Your spouse has no other source of income. (For purposes of pocketing 
cash with this strategy, the income of your spouse makes no difference. 
We mention “no other source of income” for the spouse only because we 
use that situation in the tax calculation example in the next paragraph.)
Assuming no personal exemptions except for you and your spouse and 
only the standard deduction, your net after-tax cash from this rent is 
 115Notes$2,476. (The $2,476 is less than the 14.13 percent because this is the net 
cash in your pocket after everything is considered, including the deduction 
for one-half of your self-employment tax on page 1 of your Form 1040.) 
This $2,476 is money in the bank this year and every year that you can use 
this strategy.
Keep in mind that this savings strategy costs you nothing. You simply 
make a rent payment to your spouse. This is like moving money from your 
left hand to your right hand. You just have to do it right.
Think Commercial Lease and IRS Review
If you want the rent to your spouse to stand up to scrutiny from the IRS, 
you need to think and act as if you are paying the rent to an unrelated 
third party.6 
This starts with paying a fair-market rent for the business property or as -
set. If you don’t pay fair rent, you likely will lose the business deductions.7 
Making consistent, systematic, and timely rent payments to your spouse is 
very important here. That’s what you would do with a commercial lease.
You want to make sure that you have rental money footprints, called an 
audit trail, from your sole and separate business account to your spouse’s 
sole and separate account. Canceled checks and deposit slips identify and 
prove the money footprints. Likewise, electronic transfers verify the move -
ment of money.
Besides proving that you paid the money, your audit-proofing strategies 
should include proof that you and your spouse signed a legal written 
lease and that the asset (or portion of the asset) you are leasing from your 
spouse is owned by your spouse. To stand up to IRS scrutiny, the lease 
must be an enforceable legal instrument.8
You can obtain model office and equipment leasing agreements from your 
local office store or online. You can engage your lawyer to draft a lease for 
you. Regardless of how you get the lease in place, make sure the terms are 
similar to those required by a third-party lessor and lessee. If two months’ 
advance rent is normal, your lease should require two months’ rent in 
advance. If a deposit is normal, your lease should require a deposit. You 
want to have a “normal” lease in writing.
State sales and use taxes might apply if the rental between you and your 
spouse involves equipment, furniture, or other personal property. If this is 
the case, your proper treatment of any applicable sales or use taxes helps 
prove your rental. 
116NotesGetting Bigger Dollars in the Rental Equation
Short leases call for higher monthly payments and higher profits to your lessor 
spouse. With the shorter lease, you pay more rent each month. To learn about ap -
propriate rental charges, phone, write, or e-mail commercial establishments that 
rent the items you and your spouse are considering. 
Think of all the assets you need in your business. Think next of who owns what 
you need. In a community property state, you probably own half. You can rent 
from your spouse the half owned by your spouse, including your
office; l
home office; l
cars, trucks, and vans; and l
furniture and equipment.  l
If you live in a non-community property state, your spouse may own the office build -
ing or vehicle in its entirety. This also can be true in a community property state.
Final Thoughts and Summary
The first question on this issue of renting from your spouse is: Will you or your 
spouse file a Schedule C subject to self-employment taxes? If your answer is “yes,” 
then the rent-from-your-spouse strategy can put self-employment tax money in 
your pocket. (If your net income is high so that you are paying self-employment 
taxes only at the Medicare rate, then the savings are probably too little to justify the 
strategy.)
If you are single and you like this strategy, you might consider the S corporation 
as your leasing entity. It can provide the same basic benefits as the spouse rental 
without your having to get married. If you are considering an S corporation, you 
do need to look at the extra fees and possible extra state taxes associated with the 
S corporation. 
If you are married with business income subject to self-employment taxes, you 
spend no real money to make this strategy work for you. You simple move the 
money from your hand to your spouse’s hand and allow the government to pay 
you for doing that.

Prepay Your Expenses
A Tried-and-True Planning Tactic Recently 
Clarified by Regulations
A tried-and-true tax planning tactic over the years has been to pay some of 
next year’s expenses this year so you can get the deductions this year. 
The prepayment of expenses has been used less as a planning tactic in the 
past decade, because lawmakers and the IRS erected a series of hurdles 
that created considerable confusion. But now, like a brilliant ray of sun -
shine, the IRS has issued final regulations that show exactly what you can 
and can’t do. 
Hurray, hurray for clarity! Clarity in tax law is magnificent!
The rules apply to both accrual- and cash-basis taxpayers. In this section, 
we will give you the planning tools you need as a cash-basis taxpayer. 
If, for some odd reason, you are an accrual-basis taxpayer, you will be 
happy to know that the rules outlined in this section pretty much pertain 
to you as well. This is amazing when you think of it, because under the 
accrual method you recognize the expenses as you incur them rather than 
as you pay them. But the new regulations provide a 12-month safe har -
bor rule that applies to both cash- and accrual-basis taxpayers, granting 
accrual-basis taxpayers the ability to prepay expenses much as cash-basis 
taxpayers do.
The Safe Harbor 12-Month Rule
In final IRS Reg. 1.263(a)-4(f), the safe harbor 12-month rule states that 
you may expense (other than where directly prohibited as explained be -
low) amounts paid to create a right or benefit that 
l does not extend more than 12 months, or 
l does not extend beyond the end of the taxable year following the tax -
able year in which you made the payment. 
Expensing prohibited:  When another section of the tax law says that you 
must give an expenditure a required treatment, that required treatment 
118Notesprevails. In these cases, you may not use the prepayment tax planning tac -
tic. For example, you may not use the prepayment tactic to deduct
l interest, loans, and other financial interests;1
l the costs of self-created intangibles;2 or
l furniture, equipment, and other capital assets.3
Example 1:  You are having a great year. Come December 1 of this year, 
you decide to pay your business insurance or malpractice premium, which 
carries a cost of $11,000 and covers the period from December 15 this year 
through December 14 next year. You may deduct the entire $11,000 this 
year because4
l insurance does not have a special code section governing its 
deduction;  
l coverage does not extend more than 12 months; and
l the payment does not give you benefit in the year after next year (i.e., 
does not extend beyond the end of the taxable year following the year 
in which you made the payment).
Planning note:  If you are a cash-basis taxpayer, take a look at your insur -
ance for the possibility of prepayment so you can achieve bigger deduc -
tions this year.5
Example 2:  Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the policy 
runs from February next year through February of the following year. You 
may not deduct the prepayment of this premium in December this year 
because the payment gives you a benefit in the year after next year.6
Example 3:  You are a cash-basis taxpayer who pays $3,000 a month in 
rent. On December 31 of this year, you pay 10 months of next year’s rent. 
You may deduct the $30,000 because7
l the payment does not cover more than 12 months rent, and
l the payment does not extend your benefit into the year after next year.
Planning note.  If you were on the accrual basis, you would not qualify 
for the prepaid rent deduction because of the “use of property” rule.8 
For prepayment purposes, the cash method makes prepayment easy and 
uncomplicated.
Over-the-Hump Strategy  
Assume that you are in the 48 percent tax bracket this year, but next year 
you will be in the 20 percent bracket. Pay this year and save an extra 28 
percent. 
If this happens every two years, you can use the prepayment strategy to Year 1 prepayment
DEDUCT if only for year 2
AMORTIZE if it touches 
year 3
 119Notescreate your own private income-averaging method and save the 28 percent 
every other year.
Tax-Reform Strategy 
Politicians have made tax reform a political issue for the past 25 years. 
Keep an eye on this. If next year’s rates will be lower than this year’s rates, 
you pocket the difference by prepaying this year. 
Example:  You are in the 35-percent bracket this year. Next year the 
35-percent bracket becomes a 25-percent bracket. You prepay $47,000 of 
expenses and pocket $4,700 (10 percent x $47,000).
Not a Repetitive Strategy
Say you are in the 48 percent tax bracket (15.3 percent self-employment 
tax, 25 percent federal income tax, and 7.7 percent state income tax). As -
sume further that you prepay $43,000 in expenses. That puts $20,640 in 
your pocket in tax refunds.
If your income remains the same and you do not want to give back the 
$20,640, you will have to prepay your expenses every year. Let’s say you 
do that for 25 years.
Let’s assume also that during this 25-year period, you put your one-time 
savings of $20,640 into an investment that grows at 10 percent a year, 
compounded annually after taxes. The investment grows to $223,628. You 
take the cash, pay the $20,640 in taxes caused by no prepayment this year, 
and pocket $202,988 after taxes.
Problem:  You had to put out the $43,000 prepayment a year early each 
year for 25 years, resulting in a loss of $422,892 in compounded value. 
Therefore, the change in net worth from this strategy is the $202,988 gain 
minus the $422,892 loss, for a net loss of $219,904.
Thus, use the prepaid-expense strategy to solve a current cash flow prob -
lem or pocket more tax money because this years tax rate is more benefi -
cial than next year’s tax rate.
Cash Method Makes This a Go-To Strategy
The prepaying strategy discussed in this section applies to cash-basis tax -
payers. When you are on the cash method, you can apply the 12-month 
rule to most transactions.
120NotesThe accrual-basis taxpayer also may use the prepayment strategy, but this 
taxpayer faces more rules than the cash-basis taxpayer; for example, the 
use-of-property rule discussed above. 
The reason for the difference is simple:
l The cash-basis taxpayer generally deducts expenses as payments are 
made. 
l The accrual-basis taxpayer generally deducts expenses as expenses are 
incurred.
This is a big difference. The IRS prefers the accrual method because it 
matches income and expenses, which eliminates many planning opportuni -
ties. The cash-basis taxpayer does not suffer from the matching requirement. 
With the cash method, you generally pay the taxes as you collect the cash; 
but you get the deductions when you pay the expenses, even if you pay 
them in advance using the safe harbor 12-month rule.

Guide to Section 179 Benefits for 
Your Business Property
Usually, tax law is kind to those who know what they’re doing and down -
right brutal to those who don’t. But the rules for Section 179 expensing 
contain both kindness and brutality, even for those who are up on the law .
When you buy new or used Section 179 property, you have a choice:
l write off the cost of the property over its depreciable life, or
l write off the total cost of the property (or just some of it) immediately.
Which would you rather do—write it off slowly over time or write off the 
WHOLE thing RIGHT NOW? 
Example:  You spend $2,000 for a new desk. You have two choices:
1. Depreciate the desk using the seven-year depreciation table.
2. Immediately expense all or part of the $2,000.
Because you can invest your money at a profit and because you live in an 
inflationary economy in which money becomes less valuable each year, 
the time-value-of-money rule says you are usually better off expensing 
rather than depreciating.
Example:  You have a choice. You can
l get a tax refund of $7,000 today, or 
l get a tax refund of $1,000 each year for the next seven years. 
Say you earn a 7 percent after-tax return on investments. An annual invest -
ment of $1,000 at 7 percent will grow to $9,260 at the end of seven years. 
A one-time up-front $7,000 investment will grow to $11,240 in seven 
years. In this seven-year period, the time value of money gives you an ex -
tra $1,980. That’s 21 percent more cash in your pocket. It comes as a result 
of your knowledge of how you benefit with Section 179 expensing.
To build your net worth, do two things:
l	First, put your money to work as early as possible. 
l	Second, earn a good rate of return on your investments. 
122NotesProperty That Qualifies for Section 179 
Expensing
Most of the furniture and equipment you buy for your business qualifies 
for Section 179 expensing. 
 
Generally, you may claim Section 179 expensing on both new and used 
furniture and equipment.1 Special limits apply to passenger automo -
biles and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) with gross vehicle weight ratings 
(GVWRs) in excess of 6,000 pounds. 
You may claim Section 179 expensing for computer software that’s readily 
available for purchase by the general public.2 
In general, you qualify for Section 179 expensing when you 
l purchase the property from a third party3 and 
l place the property in service for business use.4
Planning tip:  You may count built-in desks and counters as personal 
property eligible for Section 179 expensing. Local law does not govern the 
federal tax law classification of tangible personal property.5 Local law of -
ten treats fixtures as real property, but federal law treats fixtures as eligible 
Section 179 property.6
The Section 179 Purchase Requirement
To qualify for Section 179 expensing, you must acquire the property by 
purchase for business use. 
Property acquired for personal purposes and then converted to business 
use does not qualify. Similarly, property acquired by gift or inheritance 
does not meet the test for Section 179 property.
Property acquired from certain relatives and business entities does not 
qualify. For example, you do not qualify for Section 179 expensing when 
you purchase property from your spouse, ancestors, or lineal descen -
dants.7 Under this rule, property you buy from your brother or sister may 
qualify for Section 179 expensing,8 but property you buy from your father 
or mother does not qualify. Your in-laws look very good under this rule. 
Regarding business entities, if you purchase property from a corporation 
in which you have more than 50 percent ownership, that property may not 
qualify for Section 179 treatment.9
 123NotesProperty That Does Not Qualify
Section 179 property typically does not include:10
l Property that you, as an individual, lease to others (For an exception 
to this rule, see the later discussion to this section under the subhead -
ing: “Qualifying for Section 179 When You Rent Property to Your 
Corporation.”)
l Property used primarily to furnish lodging or in connection with the 
furnishing of lodging
l Air-conditioning and heating units
l Property used primarily outside the United States,11 except property 
described in Section 168(g)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code
Laying Claim to Your Section 179 Deduction
You elect to take Section 179 expensing by filing Form 4562 with your tax 
return.12 You may claim the deduction on the original tax return, even if 
you file this return late (e.g., this year’s return filed two years late).13 
If you don’t like what you did or didn’t do with your Section 179 deduc -
tion, you can amend your tax return to get it the way you want it.14  
Thus, if you took Section 179 expensing and are now sorry that you did, 
you may revoke your deduction by filing an amended return within the 
normal three-year amendment period. However, you may only do this 
once; when you revoke your election, the revocation may not be undone.15 
Likewise, if you failed to take Section 179, you may amend during the 
regular three-year period for amended returns. 
Section 179 Dollar Limits
In addition to the earned income limit (discussed below), the following 
limits can affect your Section 179 expensing:
1. A $500,000 ceiling on aggregate Section 179 expensing16 
2. A reduction in the $500,000 ceiling for each dollar of Section 179 
property placed in service during the year that exceeds $2,000,00017 
3. A $25,000 limit on an SUV with a GVWR over 6,000 pounds18
Useless for autos:  On a passenger automobile subject to the “luxury lim -
its,” section 179 expensing gives zero benefit because the law19
l	limits the expense amount to what you would otherwise depreciate, 
and 
l	eliminates depreciation to the extent you claim Section 179 expensing. 
124NotesApplying Section 179 Expensing Limits If You 
Are Married
If you file a joint return, tax law treats you and your spouse as one tax -
payer for purposes of applying the Section 179 limits. 
If you and your spouse file separate returns, you must first treat yourselves 
as one person for the ceilings and limits. Then you and your spouse may 
elect how you want to handle the allocations in your tax returns. If you do 
not make a formal election, the law makes a 50/50 allocation.20
Example:  Say you are married and you place in service $20,000 of 
qualifying Section 179 property during the year. With elections on sepa -
rately filed returns, you and your spouse may choose how to allocate the 
$20,000. You could take all, give all to your spouse, or take $15,000 and 
give $5,000 to your spouse. If you don’t choose, the law will give each of 
you $10.000.
Planning note:  Filing joint returns almost always put more tax dollars in 
your pocket than filing separate returns. Also, with the joint return, you 
do not have to make that formal election to allocate Section 179 expenses. 
Think of it this way: the joint return makes for less paperwork and fewer 
headaches.
Business Income Limits on Section 179 
Expensing
You may not use Section 179 to deduct more than your business income. 
For purposes of Section 179, your business income is more than you 
would think. It includes:21
l Net income or loss from your active businesses (e.g., Schedule C in -
come, K-1 income from your S corporation or partnership, etc.)
l Net income or loss from your spouse’s active businesses
l Gains and losses from sales of your and your spouse’s business assets 
(found on Form 4797 and technically referred to as Section 1231 gains 
and losses)
l Interest income from the working capital of your and your spouse’s 
trade or business
l W-2 and other earned income, both yours and your spouse’s
You have an active business when you meaningfully participate in its man -
agement or operations.22 
Example:  Albert, a sole proprietor, owns a salon. He employs Beatrice 
to operate it. Albert periodically meets with Beatrice to review develop -
ments relating to the business. Albert approves the salon’s annual budget 
 125Notesthat Beatrice puts together. Beatrice performs all the necessary operating 
functions, including hiring beauticians, ordering beauty supplies, and writ -
ing checks to pay the bills and the beauticians’ salaries. The IRS says that 
Albert actively participates in this salon.23
Albert also is a partner in PRS, a calendar-year partnership, which owns a 
grocery store. Charlie, a partner in PRS, runs the grocery store and makes 
all the management and operating decisions. The IRS says that Albert 
does not actively participate in this grocery store.24
Partnerships and S Corporations
With a partnership, the limits apply to both the partnership and the part -
ner, but not exactly as you would expect.25
First, the partnership calculates its Section 179 deduction subject to the 
limits. Then the partnership allocates the Section 179 deduction to the 
partners, giving them K-1s that show the expensed amounts.
When the partner does her tax return, she just ignores the partnership for 
purposes of the $2,000,000 ceiling. She considers only herself for the ceil -
ing.
If the partnership buys $2,700,000 of equipment and therefore can ex -
pense nothing, there is no effect on the partner’s individual return. Say she 
also operates a proprietorship which claims $22,000 in Section 179 ex -
pensing on its $80,000 of equipment purchases. No problem. The partner 
deducts the $22,000 of Section 179 deductions. 
The S corporation and its shareholders follow the same rules as does the 
partnership.
Many Motor Homes Exempt from $25,000 SUV 
Limit and Could Qualify for Expensing of up to 
$500,000
The $25,000 SUV limit on Section 179 expensing of SUVs does not apply 
to vehicles with GVWRs over 14,000 pounds.26 Vehicles with GVWRs 
over 14,000 pounds are eligible for expensing of up to $500,000.
Example:  On February 20 of this year, you buy a $205,000 motor 
home that has a GVWR of 21,000 pounds for use in your business as a 
transportaton and overnight vehicle. Under Section 179, you may elect to 
expense, rather than depreciate, the entire $205,000.
126NotesHow You Use the Motor Home Impacts Section 
179 Expensing
When does a motor home qualify for Section 179 expensing?
In Shirley ,27 the court addressed this question: “Is the motor home pre -
dominately used for lodging and therefore not eligible for Section 179 ex -
pensing, or is the motor home used predominately for transportation and 
therefore eligible for Section 179 expensing?“ If the motor home is used 
for both lodging and transportation, which use is the primary use?
To decide this issue, the court looked at what the motor home took the 
place of. If the motor home replaced lodging, it was a lodging facility. If 
the motor home replaced transportation, then it was a transportation facility.
While looking at the lodging, the court had to answer the question, “What 
is a facility primarily used to furnish lodging?” Voila! Property used like 
a hotel, motel, inn, or similar establishment is not a property used pre -
dominantly to furnish lodging if more than half of the rooms are used by 
transients. Normally, transient  applies to accommodations rented for fewer 
than 30 days. 
In the Shirley  case, most customers rented the motor homes for less than 
30 days. Thus, the motor homes were not facilities used predominately 
for lodging. Further, under its replacement theory, the court noted that 
the motor home renters would have had to rent motel rooms had they not 
rented the motor homes.
 
With its replacement theory, the court had no decision to make. The mo -
tor home qualified for Section 179 expensing either as
l a transportation facility or
l personal property used in the motel business.
What is your motor home? Is it a transportation facility, a home, or a ho -
tel? The right answers produce Section 179 expensing deductions. 
Planning tip:  Transportation use is your best choice. You have a transpor -
tation facility if you can prove that you used your motor home for trans -
portation on more days than you used it for lodging.
If you fail the transportation test, you have one other possibility: Is your 
motor home nothing more than a motel that houses transients? If so, your 
use fits the Shirley  case and it makes no difference how much you use the 
motor home as a hotel or for transportation.
 127NotesCertain Pickup Trucks Are Not SUVs
The $25,000 SUV limit on Section 179 expensing does not apply to pickup 
trucks with a cargo area at least six feet long that is open (or designed 
for use as an open area but enclosed by a cap) and not readily accessible 
from the passenger compartment.28 Pickup trucks with GVWRs greater 
than 6,000 pounds that pass this test are eligible for full expensing up to 
$500,000.
Example:  Say you buy a new or used $35,000 pickup truck with a GVWR 
of 7,200 pounds and a cargo area seven feet long that is not accessible 
from the passenger compartment. You may expense the full $35,000 under 
Section 179. 
Certain Cargo Vans Are Not SUVs
To qualify for Section 179 expensing of up to $500,000, you need a van 
with a GVWR greater than 6,000 pounds and that van must29
l fully enclose the driver compartment and load-carrying device, 
l not have seating behind the driver’s seat, and 
l have no body section that protrudes more than 30 inches ahead of the 
leading edge of the windshield.
If your van does not meet these qualifying tests, it is considered an SUV 
subject to the $25,000 SUV limit on Section 179 expensing.
How the $25,000 Limit Applies to SUVs and 
Crossover Vehicles
The law says that your vehicle is a tax-classified SUV subject to the 
$25,000 limit when your vehicle has a GVWR greater than 6,000 pounds 
and is30 
l	a four-wheel vehicle (i.e., not a two or three wheeler),
l	designed to carry passengers,
l	not a vehicle subject to the luxury limit (see below), and 
l	less than 14,000 pounds GVWR.
The tax classification of SUVs includes crossover vehicles and certain 
vans, but the SUV classification does not include any vehicle:31
l	Designed to seat more than nine people behind the driver’s seat (think 
passenger van)
l	Designed with an open cargo area of at least six feet that is not acces -
sible directly from the passenger compartment (think pickup truck)
l	Designed to enclose the driver compartment and load-carrying device, 
with no seating rearward of the driver’s seat and no body section pro -
128Notestruding more than 30 inches ahead of the leading edge of the wind -
shield (think van)
Not subject to luxury limit:  To qualify for expensing of up to $25,000, 
your vehicle must NOT be subject to the luxury limits. Vehicles subject to 
the luxury limits fall into the following two categories:
l Cars with unloaded  (curb) weight of 6,000 pounds or less32 
l Trucks with loaded  weight of 6,000 pounds or less
Technically this loaded weight is called the GVWR which includes33 
l	the weight of the truck, 
l	the weight of the people who ride in the truck (standard weights, not 
all the people you could pack in), and 
l	the weight of the cargo. 
Almost no cars are exempt from the luxury limits under this curb-weight 
test. For example, the really big 2016 Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupe costs 
about $417,000 and has a curb weight of only 5,840 pounds.34
When Vehicles Become Trucks for Tax-Favored 
SUV Status
For purposes of SUV status, your vehicle is either an automobile or a 
truck. You want truck . The SUV classified as a truck for tax purposes 
qualifies for up to $25,000 of Section 179 expensing.
For both the luxury auto limits and SUV expensing, lawmakers use the 
gas-guzzler definitions to define a truck and a car. This is a good thing, 
since trucks can now be built on either a truck or unibody chassis (unibody 
had traditionally been only for cars).
The gas-guzzler tax ranges from $1,000 to $7,700 and applies to automo -
biles that have a combined fuel-economy rating of less then 22.5 miles per 
gallon.35 An automobile is any four-wheeled vehicle 
l	built for use on public highways,
l	rated at 6,000 pounds unloaded gross vehicle weight or less,36 and
l	not classified as a light truck.
The Department of Transportation gas-guzzler rules consider any auto -
mobile that meets either of the following criteria a light truck:
1. The cargo-carrying area can be expanded by removing the seats using 
simple tools such as screwdrivers and wrenches, to create a flat, floor-
level surface from the front seats to the rear of the SUV .37
2. It has either four-wheel drive or a GVWR of more than 6,000 pounds 
and has at least four of the five following characteristics:38
 129Notes   l	Approach angle of not less than 28 degrees
  l	Breakover angle of not less than 14 degrees
   l	Departure angle of not less than 20 degrees
   l	Running clearance of not less than 20 centimeters
  l	Front and rear axle clearances of not less than 18 centimeters.
Quick test:  Here’s a quick test you can use on your SUV to see if it quali -
fies for section 179 expensing of up to $25,000:
l	Is the GVWR 6,000 pounds or more? If yes, continue to next bullet.
l	Does this SUV have a combined fuel economy rating of less than 22.5 
miles per gallon? If yes, continue to next bullet.
l	Does the gas-guzzler tax apply to this SUV? If no, you have an SUV 
that qualifies for expensing.
Chassis:  Your vehicle can be a light truck regardless of chassis type. Thus 
the crossover vehicles built on unibody frames, such as the Mercedes ML-
350, Volkswagen Touareg, and BMW X5, qualify for truck status as does 
the Ford Expedition built on a truck chassis. 
If a vehicle is subject to the gas-guzzler tax, you will find the tax on the 
window sticker. If the tax is there, you have an automobile, not a qualify -
ing SUV .
Applying the Definitions
Here are some practical applications of the rules for defining when a ve -
hicle is eligible for SUV expensing:
1. This SUV has a curb weight of 5,100 pounds and loaded GVWR 
weight of 6,500 pounds. For gas-guzzler tax purposes, it averages 19 
miles per gallon. The government does not levy the gas-guzzler tax 
against this SUV . Result: this SUV is a light truck eligible for up to 
$25,000 of SUV expensing.
2. This crossover vehicle is built on a unibody frame and has a curb 
weight of 4,700 pounds and a GVWR of 6,050 pounds. The gas-
guzzler tax does not apply. Result: this is a light truck eligible for up to 
$25,000 of SUV Section 179 expensing.
3. Your four-door pickup truck has a bed that extends only four feet 
behind the cab. It has a curb weight of 4,700 pounds and a GVWR of 
6,350 pounds. It is not subject to the gas-guzzler tax despite its 14 miles 
per gallon for the combined gas-guzzler mileage rule. Result: this is a 
light truck eligible for up to $25,000 of SUV Section 179 expensing.
130Notes4. Your SUV has a curb weight of 6,300 pounds and a GVWR of 9,700 
pounds. Although this is not a light truck, it is an SUV eligible for 
expensing of up to $25,000.
Avoid the Section 179 Gotcha When Renting 
Equipment to Your Corporation
Avoid the gotcha.
That’s a good tax rule to follow in all cases.
When you operate as an S or a C corporation, you generally want to get 
the money out of the corporation without exposing it to payroll taxes or 
double taxation. One technique for that is to rent equipment to your cor -
poration.
The Gotcha
As an individual, y ou can qualify for Section 179 expensing on equipment 
you rent to your corporation when you meet all three of the following 
requirements:
The lease term, considering options to renew, must be less than 50 per - 1. 
cent of the property’s class life.39
Your business deductions in the first 12 months of the lease must ex - 2. 
ceed 15 percent of the rental income.40
Your equipment rental activity may not involve holding property sim - 3. 
ply as an investment for the production of income.41 In other words, 
your rental has to rise to the level of an active business to qualify for 
Section 179 expensing.42
The 50 percent and 15 percent rules are hard to meet, but the real gotcha 
part is that the rental has to rise to the level of a business. In other words, 
you can’t qualify for Section 179 expensing as a passive investor who sim -
ply rents the equipment to his or her corporation.
Beating the Gotcha
Actually, none of the three requirements above are all that easy to meet, 
but there is a way for you to own the property personally and have the 
corporation get the deduction.
As explained in Section 41, you simply have your S or your C corporation 
reimburse you for the deduction using the employee reimbursement rules.

Move the Section 179 deduction to the corporation.3. 
Continue to own the asset personally, but now the asset’s basis in your 4. 
hands is reduced by the Section 179 deduction. (No problem—that’s 
what you were trying to accomplish in the first place.)
Create a gain or a loss when you sell the Section 179 expensed asset. 5. 
(Again, no problem—that’s what would have happened if you had 
rented to the corporation.)
Avoid claiming the asset as an “employee-business expense” where 6. 
either (a) the alternative minimum tax (AMT) would destroy that ex -
pense deduction in full, or (b) the 2 percent of adjusted gross income 
floor would cut into your deduction.
Yes, the reimbursement is the magic potion that beats the gotcha. It’s nice 
to beat the gotcha.

Section 179 Recapture Problems 
Lurk in the Shadows 
Strategies to Avoid Recapture
Here we explain what happens when you stop using your Section 179 
property, trade it, sell it, or give it away. As you will see, you have a couple 
of different roads to travel where your Section 179 deductions will make 
you either happy or really sad. This section will help you avoid the pitfalls 
and pocket the most cash. 
Don’t Let Recapture Destroy Your Deductions
Overview . If your business use of a Section 179 asset drops to 50 percent 
or less during the property’s designated recovery period, tax law makes 
you recapture and pay taxes on any advance deductions you achieved with 
expensing. In other words, the recapture rules can really hammer you. 
Avoid recapture. 
Recapture period.  To avoid recapture, you must keep your business use 
above 50 percent during the "designated" recovery periods. There are two 
of these:
l For listed property, you will avoid recapture if you keep your business 
use at more than 50 percent for the depreciation period that applies to 
the alternative depreciation system (ADS).
l For all other property, you will avoid recapture if you keep your 
business use at more than 50 percent over the MACRS depreciation 
period.
IRS Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property,  contains a table with all the 
ADS and MACRS recovery (depreciation) periods. We will discuss the 
two depreciation periods shortly, but first let’s look at what happens when 
you suffer recapture. 
Example:  In Year 1, you claimed a $53,000 Section 179 deduction on a 
qualifying motor home. In Year 3, your business use drops to zero, so you 
must recompute your Year 1 and Year 2 deductions.
Let’s say that this motor home is listed property because your primary use 
is for transportation.1 Because it is listed property, you must recompute the 
134Notesallowable deductions by using the ADS straight-line depreciation rates and 
lives,2 which will result in the following:
l A $5,300 depreciation deduction in Year 1 (10 percent of $53,000)
l A $10,600 depreciation deduction in Year 2 (20 percent of $53,000)
With Section 179 expensing, you originally deducted the entire cost, all 
$53,000 in Year 1. Now, because you let your business use decline to 50 
percent or less, you trigger the recapture computation above that produces 
a total allowable deduction for both Year 1 and Year 2 of only $15,900 
($5,300 plus $10,600). 
On this year’s tax return (your Year 3 recapture return), you must report 
$37,100 of taxable recapture income ($53,000 minus $15,900). You report 
the recapture in Part IV of IRS Form 4797, and it ends its taxable journey 
on the same tax form where you claimed the original $53,000 deduction.3 
Thus, if you reported the original deduction on Schedule C, the recapture 
amount ends up on Schedule C. 
Don’t Convert Section 179 Property to Personal 
Use during the Recapture Period
The Section 179 recapture rules and the listed property rules operate inde -
pendently of other depreciation recapture provisions. These two sections 
of the law require recapture whenever business use drops to 50 percent or 
less during the recapture period.4 
When you convert listed property to personal use before the end of the 
property’s ADS class life, you trigger depreciation recapture.5 Listed prop -
erty includes the following:6
l Passenger automobiles
l Other transportation property
l Computers and peripherals that, although not located in a regular 
office, you deduct on your taxes (Computers located in your regular 
office are not listed property.)
l Any property of a type generally used for purposes of entertainment, 
recreation, or amusement
You calculate listed property recapture by taking the difference between 
the amount expensed and depreciation (cost recovery) calculated by using 
l	ADS straight-line rates, and
l	ADS class lives.
 135NotesFor Section 179 property that falls outside the listed property category, 
you calculate the recapture by taking the difference between the amount 
expensed and depreciation calculated by using
l	the fastest allowable depreciation method available (usually MACRS), 
and
l	the shortest allowable class life (usually the MACRS life).
The fastest depreciation over the shortest life gives you the lowest amount 
of recapture.
Planning tip.  AVOID recapture due to a drop in business use to 50 per -
cent or less. Recapture due to the drop in business use is punitive. 
Tax law is much kinder to the trade-in or sale of your Section 179 property 
as discussed below . 
Avoid Gifts That Trigger Recapture of Your 
Section 179 Deductions
In general, a gift of personal property does not trigger income tax for 
either the donor or the recipient. However, a gift of Section 179 property 
does trigger the recapture tax for the business owner.7 
Example:  Last year, you claimed a $50,000 Section 179 deduction on a 
truck. This year, you give the truck to your daughter. Because of this gift, 
the recapture calculation puts $45,000 in taxable recapture income on this 
year’s return. It puts that income in the same place on the same schedule 
where you originally claimed it.8
Avoid Recapture with a Trade-In
When you trade in a business asset—for example, your car for another 
car—you are making a like-kind exchange.9 If you receive no cash or debt 
relief on the trade, you have no taxable income on the exchange.10
Example:  Two years ago, you bought a truck that qualified for Section 
179 expensing and you wrote off the entire $43,000 business cost. Now 
you want a different Section 179 qualifying truck. The dealer tells you to 
give him the old truck plus $12,000. Assuming 100 percent business use, 
this transaction produces
l no tax on the trade of the old truck, and
l a new basis in the new truck of $12,000.
136NotesThis new basis is eligible for Section 179 expensing (and/or depreciation). 
Note that there is no recapture on this transaction.
A retirement example:  Say the facts are the same as in the example above, 
but a few months after you make the trade for the new truck, you retire. 
Your new vehicle stands alone. Here are two benefits you will like:
1. You suffer no recapture tax on trade of the original business truck for 
the new business truck. 
2. You suffer no recapture on the new truck, because you are going to 
convert it to personal use upon your retirement and you will not have 
claimed any accelerated depreciation or Section 179 expensing. 
Planning tip:  Avoid trapping yourself: think about your recapture escape 
before you claim Section 179 expensing.
Avoid Recapture Detriments with a Sale
To the extent of prior depreciation including Section 179 expensing, your 
sale of furniture, equipment, or vehicles produces ordinary income.11 You 
report the income from the sale of your business assets on IRS Form 4797. 
Income from the sale of the assets you use in your business is not subject 
to self-employment taxes. 
Example:  Rhonda has a choice:
l	She could sell her fully expensed truck for $35,000 and buy a new 
truck for $55,000.
l	She could trade in her fully expensed truck plus $20,000 for the new 
truck.
Sale:  On the sale of her fully expensed old truck, Rhonda has taxable in -
come of $35,000. She offsets that taxable income by expensing the $55,000 
cost of the new truck. This gives Rhonda a net reduction of $20,000 in 
her ordinary income—the same as she gets by electing to expense the cash 
should she make a trade. Her big benefit from the sale is that the entire 
$55,000 she expenses reduces her self-employment income, netting her 
$7,771 in saved self-employment taxes.12
Trade:  There is no income tax on the trade. Rhonda expenses the $20,000 
boot to make the trade. This gives her a self-employment tax benefit of 
$2,826.13
Benefit:  The net reduction in ordinary income of $20,000 is the same in 
the trade and the sale of the old truck and purchase of the new truck. The 
self-employment tax benefit in the sale of the old truck and purchase of 
the new truck is $7,771 compared to $2,826 in a trade in of the old truck 
on the new truck. Thus, Rhonda gains $4,945 bottom-line after-tax cash 
 137Notesby knowing that, in her case where she is subject to the self-employment 
tax, the sale and purchase beats the trade. 
Summary
When the tax law gives you a great break like Section 179 expensing, you 
need an exit strategy to avoid getting burned. Seldom does the tax law give 
you a free lunch.
Your best strategy for Section 179 expensing is to keep the asset working 
in your business until the asset dies. Then you should either sell or trade it.
Don’t convert a Section 179 asset to personal use without knowing how 
much recapture you will suffer. Also, if you are thinking of retiring or oth -
erwise getting out of your business, make sure you know what recapture 
costs you may be liable for. 
In general, if property is not deducted using Section 179 expensing or 
Section 280A (listed property) MACRS depreciation, you may convert it 
to personal use without suffering a recapture tax.14

Section 22 
Add to Your Net Worth with Cost 
Segregation
Good tax planning tells you to accelerate your deductions and defer your 
income. Cost segregation can add tremendous acceleration to the de -
preciation deductions you claim on a building. That puts money in your 
pocket.
Imagine the acceleration in your depreciation deductions if 30 percent of 
your buildings could be depreciated using 5-year depreciation rather than 
27.5- or 39-year depreciation. The 5-year plan is almost eight times faster 
than the 39-year plan.
This can happen for you right now . It can happen with a building you 
already own and have owned for some time. It can happen with a building 
you plan to buy. It can happen with a renovation you are about to under -
take.
The purpose of this section is to expose you to “cost segregation,” which 
allows you to segregate a building into two components: personal property 
and land improvements. When you apply the cost segregation strategy, 
you realize deductions faster. Considering the time-value of money, you 
are adding dollars to your net worth.
One study we reviewed describes a $10 million building that segregated 
into
$2 million of equipment (20 percent); l
$2 million of land improvements (20 percent); l
$6 million of building (60 percent). l
Focus on the percentages: Had this building cost $100,000 rather than $10 
million, the percentages could have been the same. You may have an office 
in your home for which the percentages could be this high. Consider that 
20 percent of this building qualified for 5-year rather than 27.5- or 39-year 
depreciation, while another 20 percent qualified for 15-year depreciation. 
The end result: a major difference in the timing of deductions. The timing 
advantage can produce huge dollar benefits for you. 
140NotesTime-Value of Money
Tax law allows you to depreciate today’s buildings, land improvements, 
and equipment to zero. Thus, the $10 million building described above has 
the ability to produce $10 million in depreciation. 
Cost segregation hurries up your deductions. Assuming that your deduc -
tions produce tax benefits, you get the cash benefits earlier and put that 
cash to work sooner in your other investments. To illustrate, say that you 
earn 6 percent after taxes on your investments; l
are in the 50 percent tax bracket; and l
have $2 million that you could depreciate using either the 5-year  l
modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) or the 39-year 
straight-line depreciation schedule. 
Using a present value of 6 percent to put your tax refunds into today’s dol -
lars, you would have 
$852,624 in today’s dollars if you used MACRS depreciation, or l
$382,427 in today’s dollars if you used 39-year straight-line deprecia -  l
tion.
In this example, you are almost half a million dollars (223 percent) better 
off with the faster depreciation. This is real money. This is a huge differ -
ence. This is what makes cost segregation so valuable.
Will You Qualify for the Big Benefits?
Cost segregation works for you when you will
benefit from the quicker deductions (i.e., the passive loss rules do not  l
limit your deductions); 
benefit from the time-value of money (i.e., you will keep the building  l
or be in the rental business long enough to benefit); and
spend less on the cost segregation study than you realize in cash ben -  l
efits. 
To benefit from cost segregation, you must realize the tax benefits of the 
quicker deductions. You will not realize those benefits if the passive loss 
rules are limiting your real-estate loss deductions.
In general, the passive loss rules destroy the loss deduction benefits of 
rental properties. Before considering the cost segregation opportunity, you 
need to identify the effects of the passive loss rules on you. You might 
be exempt from the rules or you might be subject. If the rules apply and 
limit your losses, then creating a bigger loss with cost segregation does you 
absolutely no good.
 141NotesExample.  Your modified adjusted gross income is $200,000 and you are 
subject to the passive loss rules. You have no passive income and you have 
a $35,000 net loss on your rental properties. 
Result.  Your $35,000 loss is a passive loss, not deductible this year because 
of the passive loss rules. The loss carries forward to next year, when you 
will again look to offset it with passive income.
The passive loss rules do not apply to you if you qualify as a real estate 
professional. Similarly, the passive loss rules do not apply to your business 
building or home office, assuming you materially participate in the busi -
ness.
Planning tip.  Make qualifying to deduct your passive losses your number 
one priority in deciding whether you want to consider cost segregation. If 
you can’t deduct your losses now, you will not benefit from the time-value 
of money, meaning that you will not benefit from cost segregation.
The next consideration is the length of time you will keep the building. 
The longer you keep the building, the greater the benefit from cost segre -
gation. 
How many rental properties you own and how long you plan to own them 
are other factors to consider. With planning, you can use a Section 1031 
exchange not only to defer taxes, but also to carry the segregation benefits 
from one building to another. 
The final factor concerns the cost of the study. Surprisingly, segregation 
studies can be very reasonable, especially in light of the benefits. 
Tax Advantages to Consider
Cost segregation can produce an array of business advantages, including 
the following:
Faster depreciation l  (allowing you to put the time-value of money to 
work for you)
Section 179 expensing l  on qualifying personal property assets (usually 
in commercial buildings and home offices)
Look-back depreciation l  on a building you already own with which 
you have never used cost segregation1 (you probably don’t want to 
look back more than five years or so)
Bonus depreciation  l when your look-back period includes the bonus 
depreciation years of 2001–2004, and/or 2008-20122
A one-time big adjustment l  that you might want to use when you 
have a particular tax problem (you claim all the previous years’ depre -
142NotesEquipment Found in a Real Property Building
Cost segregation is hot not only with tax advisors and taxpayers, but with the IRS, too. The reason is 
simple: the building you see is not the building you depreciate.
The IRS Web site contains relevant court cases to help IRS examiners decide whether assets are equip -
ment or buildings.3 They need the guide because cost segregation takes the building you think you see 
and breaks it into smaller components, including equipment and building. 
For ideas about parts of a building that can be classified as equipment, review the following assets for 
which the courts have allowed equipment-style depreciation:
blowers l
cabinets l
carpeting l
chandeliers l
connecting fixtures to appliances l
coolers l
copper drain lines from refrigerators l
décor wall lights l
décor window treatments l
door units in partitions l
electric adapters, relays, and fuses l
electric gutters, plus ends and cuttings l
electrical branch to television equipment l
electrical outlets l
electrical switches (30 amps) l
electrical wiring for intercom equipment l
Eliason doors  l

spotlights and flood lamps l
storage sheds l
telephone jacks l
vinyl wall covering l
water lines to cooking tables l
 143Notesciation in one lump sum in the year of adjustment, using IRS Form 
31154)
Asset replacement identification l  for faster write-offs (As a side ben -
efit, say you identify the cost of a roof in the study, then replace the 
roof in a later year. Now, you can write off the remaining cost of the 
original roof and start the depreciation on the replacement. Without 
cost identification, you would not be in a position to write off the 
undepreciated cost of the old roof.)
Lower transfer taxes  l because you separated the cost of the personal 
property from that of the real property
Lower property taxes l  (depending on the taxes that apply to personal 
property and those that apply to real property)
No user fee payable to the IRS l  to make this accounting change5 
(Most people who make an accounting change have to pay the IRS a 
user fee of $2,500, although with gross income of less than $250,000, 
the fee is only $625.)
Immediate write-off l  for the cost of the segregation study as a busi -
ness (rental) expense in the year the study is done6
Tax Disadvantages to Consider
The first disadvantage: the depreciation recapture tax on personal property 
can be greater than the recapture tax on real property. 
To the extent of gain, the depreciation claimed on personal property is 
recaptured as ordinary income at rates up to 35 percent. The gain attrib -
utable to depreciation of real property is taxed at a maximum rate of 25 
percent. You might be looking at this difference when you sell. 
Of course, the longer you wait before you sell, the less impact the depre -
ciation recapture taxes will have. Further, you may not be in the 35 percent 
rate bracket at the time you make the sale.
Planning tip.  If you are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), 
use 150 percent declining balance depreciation on the personal property to 
avoid the 200 percent declining balance preference for AMT purposes.7
Again, you don’t want to use cost segregation if faster depreciation will 
not give you tax benefits because you suffer under the passive loss rules.
Engaging a Professional
To obtain the advantages of a cost segregation study, you must engage 
qualified professionals. This is a wise expenditure when it puts real cash in 
your pockets.
144NotesIn most cases, CPAs and engineers team up to provide cost segregation 
services. The American Society of Cost Segregation Professionals is a 
good place to look for a professional, although you should first check with 
your tax advisor for his or her recommendation.
The cost segregation professional puts together all the paperwork you 
need to prove the segregation. In general, the package you receive will be 
backed by
audit work papers, l
experience, and  l
credentials. l
If you use a professional and submit the paperwork to the IRS properly, 
you will suffer no increased risk of an IRS audit because of the cost seg -
regation study. In fact, a properly submitted cost segregation study might 
actually lower your risk of an audit, because you’re showing the IRS that 
you know the rules and have done your due diligence to comply.
Timing Your Look-Back Cost Segregation Study
When you do your look-back cost segregation study, you submit the cost 
segregation depreciation changes under the rules for an automatic change 
in accounting, which allow you to do this for free and without IRS approv -
al (the approval is automatic). But the IRS does not allow automatic ap -
proval whenever you get the urge. You get automatic approval once; after 
that, you have to wait five years or go through the IRS approval process.8 
Recommendation.  Do the cost segregation on all your properties at once. 
If you are going to change the depreciation in your business office, rental 
property, and home office, do so in a single submission.
An Unusual Opportunity
You might consider a cost segregation study when you receive an inheri -
tance. Say, for example, that your spouse dies and the property becomes 
yours with a stepped-up basis. You can use cost segregation on this new 
stepped-up basis to allocate basis to equipment and land improvements. 
You might mention to your heirs that cost segregation of the property can 
be a big benefit when they inherit the property after you die. 
 145NotesSummary
Cost segregation deserves your attention. It can create benefits with build -
ings you already own and buildings you will buy. 
The benefits are easy to quantify. Cost segregation is one of the few invest -
ments you can make that absolutely guarantees your rate of return. In 
fact, you know just about everything that will happen when you give the 
go-ahead for a cost segregation study.
Before doing the study, make sure you are on top of the passive loss rules. 
If the passive loss rules deny your annual real-estate losses, a cost segrega -
tion study will do you no good.
Also, consider the AMT in choosing the depreciation method for your 
cost-segregated personal property.
Once you have all this in order, do the cost segregation study. Smile. You 
are putting the time-value of money to work for you.

Section 23
Antiques Can Make Smart 
Assets for Your Business
Let’s say that you have narrowed the purchase of your business desk to 
either an antique or a regular desk. Each desk sells for $5,000. Which desk 
gives you the best business result? Is the difference worth thinking about?
First, some relatively recent events have pretty much turned the antique 
desk into just another asset, eligible for Section 179 expensing and depreci -
ation that produces the same business deduction results as a regular desk. 
However, the similarity in this equation ends with deductions.
There can be a huge difference in financial results at the time of sale. For 
example, in 10 years, 
the antique desk could increase in value to $15,000, whereas l
the regular desk could decline in value to $500. l
To see the true financial results, you need to look at the after-tax numbers. 
Let’s say you are in the 35 percent income tax bracket and the 15 percent 
capital gain bracket at the time of sale. On the $15,000 proceeds from the 
sale of the antique desk, your federal taxes would be
$1,500 on the $10,000 capital gain part of the profits ($15,000 selling  l
price minus $5,000 original basis times 15 percent);
$1,750 on the $5,000 of depreciation recapture ($5,000 depreciated in  l
full, taxed at the ordinary income tax rate of 35 percent).
After taxes, you pocket $11,750 on this sale of your antique desk ($15,000 
minus $1,500 minus $1,750)
On the sale of your regular desk, you pocket only $325 after taxes ($500 
sales proceeds minus $175 in recapture taxes).
The antique desk gives you 36 times more cash ($11,750 compared with 
$325). Imagine an entire office full of antiques! 
Ton of Logic
If you can buy an antique car, clock, rug, desk, cabinet, bookcase, paper -
weight, conference table, chair, umbrella stand, coatrack, library table, 
or other asset that will function just as well as a new purchase, take the 
antique that might increase in value. It simply adds to your net worth.
 147Notes
How many of the business assets you bought and used in your business 
have gone up in value? For most businesspeople, the answer to this ques -
tion is “none” or “very few .” In fact, antiques are seldom even on the 
table, so to speak. 
But now that you know their potential, give antiques a serious look. With 
antiques, you can get the best of all worlds:
Beautiful assets you use in your business  l
Assets you can depreciate and Section 179 expense against your busi -  l
ness income
Assets that can increase in value l
The Court Cases
In the Liddle1 and Simon2 cases, the appeals courts agreed with the major -
ity opinions of the Tax Court: that these two professional musicians who 
used antique and collector violins in their business as musicians for the 
Philadelphia Orchestra could depreciate the antique and collector violins 
as business assets. 
The musical instruments in these cases were almost 300 years old when 
they were purchased for about $30,000. After use in business for less than 
10 years and depreciated to zero by the musicians, the instruments were 
worth about $60,000. The courts noted that before the Economic Recov -
ery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) changed the depreciation rules, antiques 
could not be depreciated, no matter how often they were used in business.
According to the Tax Court, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and the 
Third Circuit Court of Appeals, you and these musicians may now depre -
ciate and Section 179 expense antiques. ERTA eliminated the useful-life 
rules and put in their place statutory depreciation periods. That change 
means that you now qualify for tax-favored expensing and depreciation 
when you 
physically use the antiques in the normal course of business; and 1. 
subject the antiques to wear and tear as you do any other assets.2. 
The IRS Position
The IRS did not agree with the results in the Liddle  and Simon  cases and 
issued a formal nonacquiescence in 1996, stating that it would attack tax -
payers seeking antique depreciation in the other seven circuits.3 This was 
11 years ago. The IRS has not attacked yet. 
148Notes
Your Position
As we discuss below, we think it unlikely that the IRS will attack any 
depreciation on an antique physically used in your business.  
The IRS is not going to attack antique depreciation if you live in Vermont, 
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, or the 
Virgin Islands. Why? These are the areas covered by the Second and Third 
Circuit Courts of Appeals where Liddle and Simon had their Tax Court 
wins affirmed at the appellate levels. 
Further, beginning shortly after ERTA, lawmakers improved taxpayer 
rights. Now the courts can order the payment of attorney fees when the 
IRS brings a case that is “not substantially justified.” The IRS, in its Publi -
cation  556, explains “not substantially justified” as follows:4 
The position of  the United States is presumed not to be substantially justified if  the 
IRS: 
Did not follow its applicable published guidance (such as regulations, revenue  l
rulings, notices, announcements, and private letter rulings and determination 
letters issued to the taxpayer)… 
Has lost in courts of  appeal for other circuits on substantially similar issues  l
If you live in a jurisdiction outside the Second or Third Circuits, you are not 
likely to face an IRS attack on your antique depreciation for two reasons:
The IRS has already lost in other courts of appeal—the Second and 1. 
Third Circuit Courts. (Thus, bringing a case along the lines of Liddle  
and Simon  and losing would clearly be “not substantially justified” 
and could require the IRS to pay lawyer fees.)
The IRS has not made any new challenges since it issued its nonacqui - 2. 
escence in 1996.
Your Tax Preparer’s Position
Your tax preparer can rely on Liddle  and Simon  for his position that you 
have better than a one-in-three or 50-50 chance of sustaining the antique 
depreciation deduction.
Artwork Doesn’t Make the Deduction Grade
To claim deductions for depreciation or 179 expensing of tangible prop -
erty, the asset must5
be of a type that is subject to wear and tear, and 1. 
be used in the taxpayer’s business.  2. Some tax services mis-
takenly say that Sam 
Kilpatrick lost his antique 
deductions in 2016. He 
did not lose his antiques. 
He lost his depreciation 
because he expensed the 
antiques as office sup-
plies. That’s a total no-no.  
Sam D. Kilpatrick v Comm., 
2016-166.
The antique strategy con-
tinues as a valid strategy 
as we go to press with 
this 2017 edition. If any 
changes occur, we will 
post them to the updates 
page at www.bradfor-
dandcompany.com/2017.
 149Notes
The antique violins in Liddle  and Simon  were deductible because they suf -
fered wear and tear from physical use in the business. 
In deciding that the antiques were deductible, the court followed Noyce  
and distinguished the holding in Clinger , where Ms. Clinger, a professional 
portrait painter, bought an oil painting for her business.6 However, Ms. 
Clinger merely displayed the painting on the wall. 
Unlike the violins, the painting on the wall did not endure ordinary wear 
and tear from physical use in the business. Therefore, the court ruled that 
the painting was not deductible.
Businessperson Beats Antique Dealer 
When you can use an antique in your business, you pocket more cash 
than the antique dealer would pocket. The dealer deducts the cost of the 
antique as a cost of sale when he makes the sale. He then pays taxes on 
the profits. Those profits are subject to both self-employment and ordinary 
income taxes.
As a businessperson, you have the following advantages over the antique 
dealer:
You can deduct your cost of the antique at the time of purchase, using  l
Section 179 expensing (the dealer has to treat the antique as inventory, 
and he gets no deduction for the antique’s cost until the sale takes 
place—maybe a year or so after purchasing it).
The profit in excess of your purchase price is a Section 1231 gain (be -  l
cause the asset is used in your business). Assuming no offset with Sec -
tion 1231 losses, your Section 1231 gains on the sale of antiques used 
in the business for over a year are treated as tax-favored capital gains
Retroactive Deductions
You may already own antiques that you are using in your business and 
that you have not deducted because you were following the old rules. You 
can claim the benefits from the overlooked depreciation this year by retro -
actively claiming what you missed, using IRS Form 3115. 
Example.  Eight years ago, Sam Aspen bought an antique clock to dress 
up the entryway to his office. At that time, he and his tax preparer decided 
that they would not depreciate the clock, because they were afraid of at -
tack by the IRS, as they lived outside the Second and Third Circuits. 
150Notes
Today, realizing that he can deduct this antique clock, Aspen files IRS 
Form 3115. This puts eight years’ worth of clock depreciation on Aspen’s 
tax return for this year. 
Summary
You have to love the two musicians who took on the IRS to win depre -
ciation deductions on their antique musical instruments. There must be 
something about the Philadelphia Orchestra. Over the years, musicians 
from this orchestra have won a variety of court cases on business issues 
ranging from the home-office deduction to violin depreciation.
If you were to buy antiques for your business today, you could expense up 
to $133,000 of qualifying costs. Thus, the “business antique” can produce 
immediate deductions.
When you sell, say, 11 years from now, you pay tax-favored capital gain 
taxes on any appreciation above your original basis (generally, your pur -
chase price). True, you have to pay recapture taxes on the depreciation 
claimed, but that’s a minor inconvenience when you compare the gain to 
that from the usual business asset, which is just about worthless when you 
sell it. 
The conclusion is easy: you have more after-tax cash when you choose 
antiques as working business assets.

 153Notes Section 24
Should You Use IRS Mileage 
Rates or Actual Expenses?
As we go to press, the IRS has not yet released its 2017 standard mileage 
rates. It's likely that the 2017 business mileage rate will approximate the 
2016 standard mileage rate of 54 cents a mile.1
In this section, we are going to answer the following questions, among 
others:
l Should you use the standard mileage rate to deduct the cost of your 
vehicle?
l Do you qualify to use the standard mileage rate?
l What happens when you sell or otherwise dispose of a vehicle on 
which you claimed the standard mileage rate? 
Should You Use the Standard Mileage Rate?
You have a choice:  You may use either the
l standard mileage rate, or
l actual expenses.
The standard mileage rate is in lieu of all operating expenses and deprecia -
tion or lease payments. When chosing the standard mileage rate as your 
deduction method, you deduct in addition to the standard rate 
l parking,
l tolls, 
l personal property taxes,
l interest, and
l loss on sale of the mileage-rate vehicle (assuming you don't trade).
To determine which is better—and how much better it is—you need to 
compare the standard rate with your actual expenses. To ensure that you 
get this comparison right, 
l compare expenses for the full period you plan to keep the vehicle (say, 
three or five years) and
l compare expected gains and losses on the future sale of this vehicle.
Make the comparisons with after-tax cash:  Vehicle expenses reduce 
business income, and that reduces your self-employment taxes. Gains and Go to the updates page at

IRS has released the rate 
for 2017 and what that 
rate is.

154NotesPick the Method (IRS or Actual) That Gives the Biggest Deductions
Note: You may not use the the standard mileage rate to deduct a motorcycle.2 Overview: To find which method is best, do as we have done below: compare projected actual expenses with 
IRS rates from the time you buy until the time you expect to sell, including any projected gain or loss on sale.
Facts: Y ou buy a car with a business cost to you of $37,000, expecting to drive it 60,000 miles during the 
next five years, and then selling it for $7,000 in the middle of January of Y ear 6. Y ou anticipate that the mile -
age rate will average 56.5 cents a mile and that embedded depreciation will be 23 cents a mile.
Operating expenses include:
l Maintenance (including car 
washes)
l Repairs
l Tires
l Gas and oil
l	Insurance
l	License fees
l	Registration fees
In addition to the IRS rate, you also 
deduct:
l Interest on vehicle loans 
(assuming you are not an 
employee)
l State and local personal prop -
erty taxes on the vehicle
l Parking
l Tolls
Note:  In the comparison on the left, 
we made sure that we compared 
apples with apples—none of 
these additional  expenses were 
used in either the IRS or actual 
computations.

Look at These Five Planning Tips to Help You Get 
the Most Out of Your Vehicle Expenses
Planning tip 1:  Unlike employees who may not deduct interest, self-
employed taxpayers may deduct interest on their car loans, regardless of 
whether they use the standard mileage rate or the actual expense method 
for deducting their vehicle costs.3
Planning tip 2:  If you use a home equity loan to pay for some or all of 
your business vehicle, the law treats treat the business part of the loan as a 
business loan; therefore, you deduct the interest as a business expense. 
Planning tip 3:  In addition to the IRS mileage rate, you may deduct, as 
business deductions, any state and local personal property taxes you pay 
on your standard-mileage-rate vehicle.4 
Planning tip 4:  Lawmakers recently made the sales tax deduction in lieu 
of the state income tax deduction a permanent part of the law .5 Divide 
your vehicle into its business and personal components. Add the sales tax 
that applies to the business component to your depreciable business basis. 
If you choose to deduct sales taxes in lieu of state income taxes, you may 
deduct the sales tax that applies to the personal portion of your vehicle. 
This is an easy decision if you live in a state with no income tax.
Planning tip 5:  Pay attention to your gain or loss on the sale of your stan -
dard-mileage-rate vehicle. First, you need to recognize that the mileage 
rate includes depreciation. Therefore, you have adjusted basis. That means 
you have a gain or loss on sale. Usually, this is a loss, which is to your 
benefit.The net self-employment 
tax is actually 14.13% 
because only 92.35% is 
taxable. The 35% is under-
stated because some item-
ized deductions are phased 
out. When comparing tax 
returns, we found phase-
outs offsetting the 92.35%; 
accordingly, we stayed with 
the gross amounts in this 
section of the course.  Continued from page 153
156NotesDo You Qualify to Use the Standard Mileage Rate 
on Your Vehicle?
You may not use the standard mileage rate if you 
l operate your business as a corporation and claim the vehicle as a cor -
porate expense;6
l use five or more vehicles at the same time in your business;7 
l claim a depreciation deduction on the vehicle using any method other 
than straight line (such as MACRS or bonus depreciation);8 
l claim Section 179 expensing on any part of the vehicle;9 or
l claim actual expenses on a leased vehicle.10
The new rules allow you to use the standard mileage rate on up to four 
vehicles at the same time.11 The old rule put the limit at two vehicles.
Example:  You have four vehicles in your household. You, your employee-
spouse, your employee-daughter, and your personal assistant are some -
times all on the road at the same time, driving your four vehicles. Under 
the new rule, you may claim the standard mileage rate on all four vehicles. 
Alternatively, you could claim the standard mileage rate on one of the 
vehicles and use the actual expense method on the other three vehicles. 
As you can see, qualifying for the standard mileage rate is not difficult. 
The bigger question is: Does the standard mileage rate put more money 
in your pocket than the actual expense method? Do the easy arithmetic 
described above to determine the better method.
What Happens When You Sell or Otherwise 
Dispose of a Vehicle on Which You Claimed the 
Standard Mileage Rate?
You depreciate your vehicle when you use the standard mileage method. 
The rate of depreciation is as follows:
 Year(s)  Cents per Mile
 2016 24.0
 2015 24.0
 2014 22.0
 2013 23.0
 2012 23.0
 2011 22.0
 157Notes 2010 23.0  
 2009 21.0 
 2008 21.0
 2007 19.0
 2005–2006 17.0
 2003–2004 16.0
 2001–2002  15.0
 2000 14.0
 1994–1999  12.0
 1992–1993  11.5 
 1989–1991  11.0
 1988 10.5 
 1987 10.0
 1986 9.0
 1983–1985  8.0
 1982 7.5 
 1980–1981  7.0
For tax years after 1989, the depreciation rates apply to all business miles. 
For tax years before 1990, the depreciation rates apply to the first 15,000 
miles. 
Example 1:  You bought a vehicle for $22,000 in 1987 and drove it 20,000 
miles that year. You calculate your adjusted basis by subtracting deprecia -
tion of 10 cents a mile on the 15,000-mile ceiling, not on the 20,000 miles 
you drove that year. Thus, your adjusted basis for gain or loss is $20,500 
after you subtract depreciation of $1,500 ($0.10 x 15,000 miles). 
Example 2:  You bought a vehicle for $35,000 in 2008 and drove it 20,000 
miles a year in 2008 and 2009. You deducted your car expenses using the 
standard mileage rates. Included in the standard mileage rates is deprecia -
tion of 21 cents a mile. Multiply the 21 cents by 40,000 miles and you get 
$8,400 of depreciation. Thus, your adjusted basis at the end of 2009 is 
$26,600 ($35,000 minus $8,400). 
Do you use the standard mileage rate?  If so, you will have a gain or loss 
when you sell. How much is your gain or loss? You should know! If it is a 
loss, think of this loss as money in the bank. You can deduct the loss and 
reap the tax benefits when you sell your car to a third party. 
Planning tip triggered by vehicle trades:  Did you do these two things 
with your business vehicle?
1. Did you trade your old business vehicle for your replacement business 
vehicle (say, a car for a car)?
2. Did you use IRS mileage rates?
158NotesIf you answered "yes" to both questions, your basis in the replacement 
vehicle consists of both vehicles. You might have a large deduction when 
you sell this vehicle.
  
Example:  Say you have been in business for 10 years; during that time, 
you have had four cars. You paid $30,000 for the first car; with each of the 
three subsequent trade-ins, you paid $15,000, for a grand total of $75,000 
invested in cars during your 10-year business life.
During this 10-year period, you drove your vehicles an average of 17,000 
miles a year. Further, to keep our numbers simple, let's assume that the 
average rate of depreciation in your standard mileage rate deductions is 15 
cents a mile, for a total of $25,500 over the 10 years.
This gives you an adjusted basis of $49,500 on the car you currently drive 
($75,000 minus $25,500). This basis is higher than the $30,000 sticker 
price for the car. How does that happen? Trades! Trades roll over your old 
basis to the new car. That's what allows you to think of all the cars at once 
in one easy-to-grasp arithmetic view .
If you can sell this standard mileage rate vehicle for $15,000, you have 
a deductible loss of $34,500 ($15,000 minus $49,500), producing a nice 
piece of change just for knowing what you are doing.
Luxury Auto Limits
When you use the actual expense method to deduct your vehicle, you can 
rub against the luxury auto limits that apply to depreciation deductions. 
Revenue Procedure 2016-23 contains tables detailing the limits on depre -
ciation that apply to passenger automobiles, including trucks and vans, 
first placed in service in 2016. The IRS will release the 2017 tables during 
spring 2017. 
Passenger auto limits:  The limits for passenger automobiles first placed in 
service in 2016 are as follows:12
Tax Year New Used
1st Tax Year $11,160 $3,160
2nd Tax Year 5,100 5,100
3rd Tax Year 3,050 3,050
Each Succeeding Year 1,875 1,875
The limits condemn a new car for which you choose bonus depreciation to 
a maximum of $23,060 in depreciation during the first five years of own -
 159Notesership. The practice of restricting depreciation on cars goes back to 1984, 
when Congress defined and limited deductions on so-called luxury cars. 
Planning note:  The luxury limits often mean that you have a deductible 
tax loss when you sell your business car to a third party. 
Question:  If you sold your business car today, would you have a gain or a 
loss? How much? 
Note:  When you sell a car that you deducted using the IRS mileage rate, 
you also have a taxable gain or deductible loss. 
Limits on light trucks and vans:  For purposes of the luxury limits, the 
term "trucks and vans" refers to passenger vehicles classified as trucks, 
including minivans and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). This group is clas -
sified as "light" because it fails the more than 6,000 pound GVWR test; 
therefore, luxury limits apply. The depreciation limits for light trucks and 
vans first placed in service during 2016 are as follows:13
Tax Year New Used
1st Tax Year $11,560 $3,560
2nd Tax Year 5,700 5,700
3rd Tax Year 3,350 3,350
Each Succeeding Year 2,075 2,075
This table condemns the new light truck or van to a maximum of $24,760 
in depreciation during the first five years of ownership. In other words, 
Congress thinks that a new light truck, van, crossover vehicle, or SUV 
costing $24,760 is a luxury vehicle.
Remember, trucks, vans, and SUVs with gross vehicle weights of 6,001 
pounds or more avoid the luxury limits. The first-year limits on these ve -
hicles are as follows:
l For qualifying SUVs, up to $25,000 in Section 179 expensing, plus 50 
percent bonus depreciation, and up to 20 percent MACRS deprecia -
tion.
l For qualifying heavy pick up trucks and vans, up to $500,000 in Sec -
tion 179 expensing, plus 50 percent bonus depreciation, and up to 20 
percent MACRS depreciation.

 Endnotes–Section 24Summary
To determine whether the standard mileage rate of 56.5 cents a mile is 
right for you, compare it with your actual expenses (operating expenses 
plus either depreciation or lease payments). This takes only a few minutes 
and can produce some true savings. Using the right method could easily 
enable you to pocket thousands in after-tax cash.
If you will save money with the standard mileage method, make sure that 
you qualify for the deduction. 
If you used standard mileage rates, be sure to calculate gain or loss on 
sale. Not only is this the law, but the results are usually to your benefit. 
Don't procrastinate—make the gain or loss on sale calculation now .
If you have traded in business cars, consider all the cars in the string of 
trades. A trade (technically a Section 1031 exchange) rolls over the basis 
of your vehicle to the new vehicle, which can produce some magnificent 
deductions when you sell the new vehicle to a third party. 
 161Notes
Section 25
Avoid Taxes with Section 1031 
Exchanges of Vehicles
All Exchanges Work, Including the Delayed and 
Reverse Starker Exchanges
How would you like to sell your old business vehicle without paying any 
taxes on the gain? That’s exactly what you can do with a properly designed 
1031 exchange. In this case, you first engage an exchange intermediary 
(sometimes called an exchange facilitator) for the proper paperwork and 
timing on the sale and replacement vehicles. 
You also can do a two-party 1031 tax-deferred exchange by going to the 
dealer and trading your old vehicle for a like-kind replacement. You do 
not need an intermediary or a facilitator to make this happen.
More business people are paying more taxes on their vehicle sales. Why? 
They took advantage of Section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation 
when it was available.  Now, when it’s time to sell, the basis is low (maybe 
even zero) and the taxes are high. Hence, the need for the 1031 vehicle 
strategies we give you in this section.
 
This section shows you how to stop paying taxes on the sale of your ve -
hicles. In the first part of the section, we will show you how to identify the 
tax problem or benefit with your vehicles. In the second part, we show you 
how to apply the immediate, delayed, and reverse 1031 exchanges to your 
vehicles. 
You Have Gain or Loss
If you own your business vehicle, you have a reportable tax gain or tax 
loss when you sell that vehicle, regardless of how you deducted it. To plan 
wisely, you need to know if you have a gain or loss. Why?
l Gains create taxes, which you can avoid with 1031 exchanges.
l Losses create cash from reduced taxes, which you can realize by sell -
ing your vehicle to a third party. 
162NotesTax law gives you only two ways to deduct vehicles:
1. The IRS standard mileage rate method
2. The actual expense method
Regardless of the deduction method you use—mileage rate or actual 
expense—the vehicle sale produces a taxable gain or a deductible loss. 
Example 1:  Wilson uses the IRS standard mileage rate to deduct his car. 
In 2010, he drove 30,000 business miles and used 50 cents a mile as his 
deduction. Inside the 50 cents is depreciation of 23 cents a mile.1 Thus, 
by claiming the 50 cent mileage rate, Wilson depreciated his car $6,900 in 
2010, and he will have a gain or loss when he sells the car.
Example 2:  Nelson used Section 179 to expense the entire business cost of 
his qualifying SUV . If Nelson sells the SUV , he will pay taxes on his gain 
(at ordinary rates to the extent of his expensing benefit). 
Six Easy Steps to Find Your Vehicle’s Gain or 
Loss
Remember, if you own the business car, you have a gain or loss when you 
sell it. If you want to make a wise decision on your vehicle, you need to 
know your gain or loss before you take action.
Step 1. Beginning Basis
Example 1:  Sampson bought a $30,000 car, paying $5,000 down and 
financing $25,000. Her beginning basis is $30,000, the amount paid. 
Example 2:  Nash bought a personal car for $30,000. She converts the per -
sonal car to business use when it has a retail Blue Book  value of $23,000. 
Nash uses the lower of the original cost or the market value at the date of 
conversion to find her beginning basis of $23,000.2
Example 3:  Mason converted her personal vehicle to business use when it 
had a market value of $30,000. She later traded this vehicle and $15,000 
for vehicle number 2. Later, she traded vehicle number 2 plus $15,000 for 
vehicle number 3, then traded number 3 plus $15,000 for vehicle num -
ber 4, which she currently drives. Her original cash basis is $30,000, plus 
$15,000, plus $15,000, plus $15,000, for a total of $75,000. 
Step 2. Split Basis between Business and Personal
To find your business basis, consider only the miles driven since you 
started using the vehicle for business. Mason, from Example 3 above, 
 163Notesdrove her four vehicles a total of 250,000 miles, of which 200,000, or 80 
percent, were for business. Thus, her business basis is $60,000 (80 percent 
x $75,000) and her personal basis is $15,000.
Business:  On the business part, you deduct losses and pay taxes on the 
gains. 
Personal:  On the personal part, you may NOT deduct the losses, but you 
pay taxes on the gains.
Step 3. Split Sale Proceeds between Business and Personal
Let’s go back to Mason’s fourth vehicle, the one she now drives. Say she 
could sell that vehicle for $20,000. In Step 2, Mason had business use 
of 80 percent; therefore, she has business sale proceeds of $16,000 (80 
percent of $20,000) and personal sale proceeds of $4,000 (20 percent of 
$20,000). 
Step 4. Find Adjusted Basis
At the time of sale, you are selling two assets: a business vehicle and a per -
sonal vehicle. We will look at the business and personal aspects separately, 
starting with the business aspect.
The final number you need to find for the business gain or loss is deprecia -
tion (including any amounts expensed using Section 179). You can find 
this number in your tax returns if you used the actual expense method.
If you used the IRS method, the depreciation is embedded in the mileage 
rate. Either way—actual expense or IRS mileage rate—you claimed depre -
ciation benefits in your tax returns. 
As with all assets, you calculate gain or loss by comparing net sales pro -
ceeds with your adjusted basis. Typically, your adjusted basis is
l beginning basis,
l plus improvements,
l minus depreciation. 
Mason claimed $23,000 in business depreciation on her four vehicles. 
Again, remember that regardless of how Mason deducted her vehicles—
IRS mileage rate or actual expense method—she claimed depreciation in 
her tax returns. Let’s find Mason’s adjusted basis in her vehicle. 
Her original business basis is $60,000 (see Step 1). She made no improve -
ments to her vehicles. Her business depreciation (and Section 179) de -
ductions totaled $23,000. Accordingly, Mason’s adjusted basis is $37,000 
($60,000 minus $23,000). 
164NotesStep 5. Calculate Business Gain or Loss
Here is how Mason calculates her business loss on the sale of her car for 
$20,000: 
 Business proceeds (Step 3) $ 16,000
 Adjusted basis (Step 4)   -37,000
 Business loss $-21,000    
When you will have a loss, you want to sell the vehicle to a third party so 
you may deduct the loss. 
Planning tip 1: Do not sell the vehicle to a relative or to a corporation of 
which you own 50 percent or more. In most cases, this will cancel your 
loss and neither you nor your relative will get any benefit from the loss 
deduction.3
Planning tip 2:  If you have a gain, use the Section 1031 exchange to avoid 
taxes on the gain.
Step 6. Calculate Personal Gain or Loss
Generally, vehicles go down in value, so your odds of having a taxable 
gain on the personal part are slim. But in those rare instances when 
vehicles appreciate in value, you could have a gain on your personal part. 
Here is how Mason calculates her personal part:
 Personal proceeds (Step 3) $  4,000
 Personal basis (Step 2) -15,000
 Nondeductible loss $-11,000
Section 179 Expensing and Bonus Depreciation 
in Previous Years Make Taxable Vehicle Gains
During the past seven years, tax law has created big deductions for Section 
179 expensing and, in certain years, added first-year bonus depreciation. 
If you took advantage of these breaks, you are likely to have a taxable gain 
on the sale of your vehicle.
Nelson, for example, expensed the entire $25,000 cost of his SUV . Thus, 
his adjusted basis is zero. If he sells this SUV for $14,000, he will have a 
gain of $14,000, taxable as ordinary income. If Nelson’s combined federal 
and state tax rate is 40 percent, he will pay $5,600 tax on the sale. But with 
a Section 1031 exchange, Nelson defers this $5,600 tax to the replacement 
vehicle, where, depending on how well he plans, the tax may or may not 
pose a problem in some future year.
 165Notes Applying Four Types of Section 1031 Exchanges 
to Vehicles
In general, you may use the following four types of exchanges with your 
vehicles:
1. Two-party exchange
2. Simultaneous exchange
3. Delayed exchange
4. Reverse exchange
The IRS now considers the following vehicles as like-kind for purposes of 
a Section 1031 tax-deferred exchange:4 
Cars l
Crossover vehicles l
Sport utility vehicles (SUVs) l
Minivans l
Cargo vans l
Light, general-purpose trucks for use over the road and having actual  l
unloaded weight of less than 13,000 pounds
The official definition of “unloaded vehicle weight” according to De -
partment of Transportation regulations is “the weight of a vehicle with 
maximum capacity of all fluids necessary for operation of the vehicle, but 
without cargo, occupants, or accessories that are ordinarily removed from 
the vehicle when they are not in use.”5
Under this definition of “like-kind,” you can exchange a Ford F-450 truck 
(this is a really big truck) for a little car such as a Ford Focus.
1. Two-Party Exchange
When you trade in your old vehicle for a replacement vehicle, you are en -
gaging in a two-party tax-deferred exchange. Most often, you do this with 
the dealer, arriving in your old vehicle and leaving in the new one. 
2. Simultaneous Exchange
Technically, in the simultaneous exchange, you use a qualified intermediary 
to facilitate the exchange. When the exchange is simultaneous, you arrive 
with your vehicle title and leave with the title to the replacement vehicle.  
166Notes3. Delayed Exchange
Do you like to sell your vehicles personally? If so, the delayed exchange is 
for you. Many people refer to the delayed exchange as the “Starker ex -
change,” after the Supreme Court case in which Starker prevailed.
Step 1:  Before doing the delayed exchange, you should find a qualified 
intermediary who will facilitate your exchange and ensure that you meet 
the tax-deferral rules. In Google, we entered “1031 exchange intermediary 
cars trucks fees” and got 950 hits, including many with fees under $500 for 
the entire exchange. 
Since the exchange of a vehicle is far simpler than the exchange of real 
estate, you might find or negotiate lower fees. Obviously, the fee will affect 
your desire to do the exchange.
Let’s say you find a fee of $450 and you can sell your vehicle for $5,000 
more than a dealer will give you. Obviously, you want to do the exchange, 
which means you sell the vehicle using an intermediary, pay the intermedi -
ary $450, and pocket the extra $4,550. The delayed exchange allows you 
to do this. 
Planning note: You do not physically pocket the money, as cash receipts 
and debt reduction trigger taxes in a 1031 exchange. You realize the cash 
in the form of paying less for the replacement vehicle (so, really, you do 
have $4,550 more cash in your pocket).
Step 2:  Here is an amazing thing: In the delayed exchange, you actually 
market the vehicle in your normal manner. When you find the buyer, 
you use the forms and exchange accommodation language that make 
the intermediary a “substitute seller.” Thus your first step is to find the 
intermediary, so your second step will be easy.
Step 3:  You have 45 days to identify the replacement vehicle.6 You will 
probably do this much quicker, or your feet will do a lot of walking.
Step 4:  You must own the replacement property within the parameters of 
the 180-day rule, which means the earlier of 7 
l 180 days after transfer of the property given up, or 
l the due date (with extensions) of your tax return.
In practice, you will have the intermediary buy your new vehicle almost 
immediately, maybe even before you get rid of the old vehicle, in which 
case you will use the reverse exchange.
 167NotesBrief review:  In the delayed exchange, the use of the intermediary allows 
you to 
l sell your old car to a third party,
l buy a new car, and
l defer the taxes.
Is this easy, or what? Absolutely! Tax knowledge is powerful; in this case, 
letting you do what you wanted to do in the first place and allowing you to 
defer the taxes into the future (with planning, perhaps forever).
4. Reverse Exchange
The reverse exchange is exactly that: the delayed exchange in reverse.8 
Here, as with the delayed exchange, put your intermediary in place before 
you do anything. 
With the reverse exchange of a vehicle, you buy your new vehicle first (so 
you don’t have to walk). Actually, your intermediary buys it. Then you sell 
your old vehicle, just as you planned, with the intermediary as substitute 
seller. 
The IRS gives your intermediary a new name in the reverse exchange, call -
ing the facilitator an “exchange accommodation titleholder.”
A Closer Look at the Intermediary
The IRS has embedded the intermediary (exchange accommodation title -
holder) in its 1031 exchange rules, making it far easier than ever before to 
do a 1031 exchange. You simply use the intermediary as a substitute buyer 
and substitute seller of your property. In effect, the IRS allows you to 
make the intermediary the facilitator of the exchange.
Summary
If you will have a big gain on the sale of your business vehicle, you should 
defer that tax and keep the money in your pocket, working for you. Think 
of it this way: if your tax is $10,000 on a sale, you can use the 1031 ex -
change to keep the whole $10,000 in your pocket (where you can see it, 
use it, and enjoy it). 
The 1031 exchange is the cure for the taxes on the sale of your old vehicle. 
With planning, the taxes on the old vehicle could disappear forever, but 
that’s beyond the scope of this section. For now, let’s just use the 1031 
exchange to move those taxes to the next vehicle.
 
168NotesYour choices for the exchange involve either an intermediary or another 
person, probably a vehicle dealer. You make this choice by counting your 
money. You need to consider the cost of the intermediary and then answer 
these questions: How much cash will you part with to get the replacement 
vehicle after you pay the fees to the intermediary? Next, how does this 
compare with what it would cost you to get the new vehicle if you simply 
did the exchange with the dealer?
Once you engage an intermediary, you can do a simultaneous exchange, a 
delayed exchange, or a reverse exchange. 
Finally, remember that you only do the exchange to save money on your 
taxes. If the sale of your car would produce a loss, you do not trade it or 
do an exchange with an intermediary. Instead, you sell the vehicle to a 
third party and deduct your loss.
If the sale of your vehicle would produce a taxable gain, you use the 1031 
exchange to avoid taxes on the gain.

Example:  You sell your car to your brother for its $10,000 fair market 
value and that produces a $5,000 loss. You may not deduct the loss.
Related party loss deduction—probably none:  When the related party  
sells the property to a third party, he, she, or it may deduct the loss, but 
only to the extent that a third-party sale produces a profit.2
Example 1:  Your brother sells the car for $10,000. He has no gain or loss. 
Worse, your $10,000 loss is lost forever.
Example 2:  Your brother sells the car for $11,000. He gets to offset the 
gain by using $1,000 of your $5,000 lost loss. You still get nothing. 
Who are your relatives?  For purposes of this tax law, your relatives are 
your:3
l Husband or wife
l Mom and dad
l Grandmother and grandfather
l Sons and daughters
l Grandsons and granddaughters
l Brothers and sisters
l Corporations and other entities, when you and your relatives own 50 
percent or more of them
Planning tip:  In-laws and cousins are not “tax relatives.” You can sell to 
them. Remember, you may not deduct a loss on a sale to a relative. So do 
not sell loss assets to relatives.
Caution:  Never make a gift of a loss-deduction car. Reason: The loss gets 
lost, as explained below .
Value of a car for gift tax purposes:  Tax law assesses gift tax on fair 
market value at the date of the gift.4 Your market value on the gift of a car 
is the price that the public pays an auto dealer for the car (generally, retail 
170Notesblue-book value).5 Market value is not the price you could fetch by selling 
the car yourself.6
Basis of a car gift:  Your income tax basis is different from your gift tax 
value. To find gain or loss on sale for income tax purposes, tax law makes 
the donee look to the donor’s basis.7 Thus, when you make a gift of your 
car:
l Fair market value decides the gift tax, and
l Basis leads to gain or loss, and that decides the income tax.
Big ouch—loss on sale:  To find loss on sale, tax law makes the donee 
seller go to the date of gift and use as basis the lower of:8
l Donor’s basis
l Fair market value
Obviously, this rule reduces the benefits of losses on resale of property 
acquired by gift. 
An ugly example: Sam Wilson kept his business car in mint condition so 
he could give it to his teenage son. This was Sam’s third business car. He 
traded in car 1 on car 2 and then traded in car 2 on car 3. At the time Sam 
wants to give his car to his son, Sam’s car has:
l A business basis of $45,000
l A business selling price of $5,000
l A business loss of $40,000
Sam gives the car to his son. The son sells the car for $5,000. The $40,000 
loss gets lost.
Money strategy:  Never make gifts of property that you can sell at a loss. 
Instead, sell the property and deduct the loss.
Example:  Sam sells the car, deducts his $40,000 loss and pockets $20,000 
in tax benefits. Now he can buy his son four cars.

To Buy or Lease Your Next 
Business Vehicle
Overview:   You need to consider:
l Out-of-pocket costs
l Cash available
l Tax law rules
l Time value of money
Gut check:   Also, you need a “gut check.” Do you look forward to walk -
ing into a car dealership and walking out with a good deal?  Do you an -
guish at the thought of negotiating with the car dealer?  Whether you buy 
or lease, negotiate or not, this section of the course will help you find the 
best deal.
It is a jungle out there:   Before we get into details, you need to know that
l sometimes leasing is better than buying.
l sometimes leasing charges are so outrageous that the lessors warrant 
jail for car theft.1 In Florida, some leasing companies take the trade-in 
vehicle and give the customer zero in return—stealing the traded car 
from the unwary customer2
l Sometimes companies lease cars at great deals to ensure loyalty and 
get customers back into the showrooms.
On the other hand, there are many horror stories from buyers who got 
fleeced.
Best way to compare:  The formula on the next page gives you the best 
way to compare the rent-or-buy results. You will need a financial calcula -
tor to make the present-value computations.
Did you lease or purchase?  Is your car lease a true lease or is it a purchase 
for tax purposes?  If you acquire title or equity, you treat your car lease 
payments as purchase payments for tax purposes.3 Generally, for tax pur -
poses, you bought the leased car if any one of the following is true:4
l Your rent payments build equity. 
l You get title to the car after you make payments.
l The amount paid to use the car for a short period approximates the 
amount you would pay to own the car. 
l You have the option of buying the car at a nominal price after the 
lease.

Simple Arithmetic Calculation (using quick-and-easy numbers):
1. Total all payments to buy the car and subtract residual value
2. Total all payments to lease the car
Compare with the same periods of time—three-year purchase compared to a three-year lease.
Residual value comes from the lease—it’s the amount you pay to buy the car at the end of the 
lease.CompareCompare
 173NotesTrue lease:   For tax purposes, you have a true lease even if you can buy 
the car at lease end for its “clean” value, the value published in the Na -
tional Auto Research Black Book.5 In other words, if you pay fair market 
value to buy the car at lease end, your lease can be a true lease. You also 
have a true lease for tax purposes if you have the option of buying the 
car at its projected end-of-lease residual value.6 You negotiate and set this 
value when you sign the lease. Because you set the buyout price at fair 
value when you sign the lease, you call this lease a closed-end lease.
Open-ended lease:  In an open-ended lease, you do not know your total 
liability until you turn in the car. If actual residual value exceeds the esti -
mate, you pay the difference. On the other hand, if the estimate exceeds 
the actual residual, you get a refund. In the open-ended lease, the leasing 
company passes the residual value risk to you. 
Tax law gives special treatment to open-ended leases of cars for business 
purposes.7 To figure out if the open-ended lease is a true lease or a sale, 
tax law says that you do not consider the car’s residual value.8 You get to 
exclude residual value from the tax lease or buy rules only when:9
l You lease a car, truck, or trailer.
l You certify in writing to the leasing company, under penalties of per -
jury, that you will use the car more than 50 percent for business.
l The leasing company states clearly in writing that it told you that you 
are not the owner of the leased property for tax purposes.
l The leasing company lacks knowledge that your certification is false.
l The leasing company has a tax-law defined liability in the car it is 
leasing to you.
Again, when you meet the above rules, you may exclude residual value 
when figuring whether a lease is a true lease or conditional sale. You sub -
ject all other elements of the lease terms to the same lease-versus-buy tests.
Leases of luxury cars:   You deduct the rent you pay on a car lease in pro -
portion to your business use. If you lease a car worth more than the luxury 
limits, you must add to your business income a dollar amount specified by 
IRS tables.  The IRS uses the “add back” to level the deductions of a lease 
to those of a purchase. You find IRS “add back” tables in IRS Publication 
463, Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses.  An example auto table 
appears on the next page. The IRS publishes different tables for leases of 
trucks, vans and electric cars.

 175NotesExample:  Say you leased a $40,500 car for $500 a month over 36 months. 
Your first-year add-back amount is $25 (see the table on the left). Thus, 
you deduct $6,000 and add back $25 for a net lease deduction of $5,975. 
You add back $56 next year and $82 the year after. (If business use is 80 
percent, you multiply all amounts by 80 percent.) 
Down Payments Usually Make for Deductible 
Advance Rents
Technical point:  With the exception of the safe harbor for prepaying rent 
as discussed in the “Prepay Your Expenses” section of this course, you 
generally may not deduct rent paid in advance. 
The down payment you make when you enter into a vehicle lease would 
usually fail the safe harbor in the “Prepay Your Expenses” section. Thus, 
on your vehicle lease, you generally write the down payment off in equal 
amounts as rent over the life of the lease.10
Why missed:  Many taxpayers report only lease payments in the organiz -
ers they complete for their accountants or in the interview section of a tax 
preparation program, like Turbo Tax. 
Example:  You lease a new car for $2,400 down and $400 a month for 
two years. Your rent totals $12,000 [$2,400 down plus $9,600 ($400 rent 
x 24 months)]. You deduct $500 a month for each month of business use. 
If business use is 85 percent, you multiply the rent times the 85 percent 
business-use percentage. 
Trade-In of Personal Vehicle on a Lease Gives 
You Deductible Advance Rents
Technical note:  The trade of a car on a lease is not a tax-deferred ex -
change because you did not trade like-kind property.11
Treat the value of the trade-in as prepaid rent:  As a cash basis taxpayer, 
you can deduct certain prepaid rent as explained in the “Prepay Your Ex -
penses” section of this course. It is highly unlikely that the value of your 
trade-in is going to qualify for the prepaid rent safe harbor deduction. In 
general, your trade-in is going to count as rent during each month of your 
lease.12
Why missed:  As with the down payment discussed above, you often re -
port only the monthly rents and miss the rent deduction available because 
of the trade-in.
176NotesExample:   You trade your existing personal car on a new car lease. The 
dealer gives you a cash credit of $12,000 for your existing car and charges 
rent of $300 a month for two years. Your rent over the 24 months will total 
$19,200 ($12,000 down payment from the trade-in value plus 24 times 
$300). You deduct your new car lease at the rental rate of $800 a month 
($19,200 divided by 24 months). 
Planning tip:  Make sure you tell your tax preparer that you traded your 
old personally-owned car on the new leased car. Many taxpayers only tell 
about the new lease payment, and that puts the preparer in the dark. Put 
your preparer in the light. Tell him or her exactly what you did!
Trade-In of the Business Vehicle You Own on a 
Lease Generates Both Advance Rent Deductions 
and Tax Gain or Loss
Technical reminder:  Remember, the trade-in of a car on a lease is not 
a tax-deferred exchange because you did not trade like-kind property.13 
Thus, think of the trade as a cash transaction in which:
 You sell the car traded in for cash equal to its fair market value l
 You make a cash down payment on the lease equal to the cash re -  l
ceived for the traded-in car
Trade personal car:  If you traded your personal car on the lease of your 
new business car, you sold the personal car for its fair market value. You 
probably have no taxable gain or deductible loss because you probably 
sold the car for less than you paid for it. The government does not allow 
deductions for personal losses.14 However, the government taxes personal 
gains.
Trade business car:  If you trade your existing business car on the lease of 
a replacement business car, you treat the trade as a sale. You must com -
pute gain or loss on sale. 
Planning tip 1:  With today’s restrictions on luxury car depreciation, most 
business car sales produce deductible losses. 
Planning tip 2:  Have you been in business for many years? Have you 
always traded the old business cars for new business cars? Did your trades 
take place every two, three, or four years? Did you drive nice cars? Your 
basis easily could be $40,000 to $70,000 on a car with a fair market value 
of $15,000. You could have a $25,000 to $55,000 tax-deductible loss on 
the trade of the car for a leased car.
 177NotesPlanning tip 3:  Did your trade for the leased car occur during the past 
three years? Did you fail to claim the loss deduction? If so, you may obtain 
a refund by amending your return.
Summary tip:  When you trade your existing business car for a leased car, 
you are not trading. You are selling the existing car and making a deposit 
on the new car lease. That trade can produce a:
 Desirable tax-deductible loss on disposition of the old car l
 Desirable write-offs of the trade-in value (advance rent deposit) over  l
the life of the lease

Building More Business Miles 
with Audit-Proof Records
Know Your Business Miles
Official method:  The more business miles, the greater your business-use 
percentage and the greater your deductions. Tax law uses mileage to find 
your business-percent use of cars.1
Commute:  You have a personal trip (called a commute) when you drive 
from home to one or more “regular places of business.”2 Thus, you take 
an ugly personal trip from your home to your downtown office. Tax law 
calls it a commute. It’s personal and nondeductible.
Escapes from commuting rules:  The IRS lets you escape the commuting 
rules and deduct trips from home to business locations when:3
l You drive to a “temporary work location” on the way to your “regular 
work location”
l You drive from your “home office” to work someplace (for this rule to 
apply, you must deduct the home office as a principal office, not as a 
meet-and-greet place or separate structure)
l You have no office at home and none downtown, and you drive to a 
work location outside the metropolitan area where you live and nor -
mally work
Regular work locations defined:  Your “regular” work locations are those 
where you work or perform services regularly. “Regular” does not mean 
you have to work there each week or on a set schedule.4 A doctor may 
travel from his or her home to several regular work stops, such as:5
l Offices
l Clinics
l Hospitals
Temporary stops defined:  The IRS defines a “temporary stop” as any 
location where you perform services on an irregular or short-term basis 
(location that you visit for one year or less).6 
180NotesWhen a Mile Is a Business Mile
This flowchart applies to a single business. If you have multiple businesses or you are a W-2 employee 
and working your business part-time, look at IRS Publication 463 for the business-mile rules.

 181NotesExample 1:  You have a personal commute (nondeductible) when you 
drive from home to your office downtown.7
Example 2:  Your trip from home to a temporary business stop (to see a 
prospect) produces business mileage.8 Then your trip from the temporary 
stop to your office produces business mileage.9 
Example 3:  You have business mileage when you drive 200 miles from 
your home to attend a training course in another city.10
Example 4:  You claim a deduction for an office in your home on the basis 
that your home office is your principal office. All trips from home to all 
business locations produce business miles.11
Example 5:  You do not qualify for the home office deduction, and you 
have no office outside the home. Your trip from home to see a prospect 
and return is a personal, nondeductible commute. 
Technical point 1:  The person with no principal office in the home and 
no office outside the home counts as personal commuting mileage the trip 
from:
l Home to first business contact, and 
l Last business contact to home.
Technical point 2:  The “office-less” person may not deduct those first and 
last business stops, but may deduct mileage going from business stop one 
to business stop two, etc.12 
Two business locations:  You count miles driven between two business 
locations as business mileage.13 Thus, trips between two job locations out -
side the home produce deductible mileage. Similarly, once you make your 
first business stop and then make a number of other business stops, your 
business mileage keeps growing. Say, for example, you drive from:
l Home to temporary stop
l Temporary stop to office
l Office to client
l Client to office 
You have 100 percent business mileage. 
Value:  If knowing the mileage rules increases your car deductions by 20 
percent, how much does that put in your pocket? That depends on the car 
you drive and the expenses you incur. With $10,000 in deductions, that 
puts an extra $2,000 on your return, every year you are in business. Or to 
put this another way, the car information is worth a lot of money.Eliminate commuting with 
an administrative office in 
your home. Tax law treats 
administrative offices as 
principal offices. (See the 
home office discussion for 
details.)Eliminate commuting with 
temporary stops.
Don’t be without an office. 
182NotesProtect Your Mileage by Knowing These Seven 
Mileage Myths
Overview:  Do not get trapped by mileage myths. Avoid myths! Review 
the following myths frequently to make sure your mileage is on track for 
unquestioned deductibility.
Mileage myth 1 —My car is a moving billboard. The “moving billboard” 
(advertising display on the car) does not convert personal miles to business 
miles.14
Mileage myth 2 —My car is a portable telephone booth. Making business 
calls from your “mobile telephone booth” (car phone) does not convert 
personal miles to business miles.15
Mileage myth 3 —My car is a moving conference room. Collecting busi -
ness associates for a discussion in your “migratory meeting room” (car 
seats) does not convert personal miles to business miles.16
Mileage myth 4 —I reserve a special vehicle only for hunting and fish -
ing trips. Driving your car to entertainment activities makes your car an 
entertainment facility, and that mileage is not deductible (if such mileage 
is more than incidental).17
Mileage myth 5 —My car is a “production of income” vehicle. Production 
of income mileage is not business mileage. You may deduct such mileage, 
but it does not count as business mileage for purposes of the more-than-50 
percent-business-use rule discussed later.18
Mileage myth 6 —I stop at the post office to eliminate my commute. A 
stop at the post office on the way to the downtown office is not a stop at 
a temporary location. To be temporary, you must perform services at the 
stop.
Mileage myth 7 —My trips are outside the metropolitan area. Do not 
count on driving outside your metropolitan area to a business stop. The 
metropolitan area covers the city, its suburbs, and some distance beyond.19 
In Walker, the IRS and the court agreed that the metropolitan area for this 
logger covered the entire Black Hills National Forest.20 The court noted 
that the forest seems large, but it covers less than 54 percent of the Chi -
cago metropolitan area.
 183Notes
This is a quick-and-easy 
calculation that tells you 
what’s best for you every 
time.
The calculation is over your 
use of the car. That’s where 
the estimated sales pro-
ceeds come into play.Using Two Vehicles Is an Easy Way to Increase 
Your Tax Deductions
Old advice:  In the past, your advisors told you to drive one car for busi -
ness and the other car for personal purposes. The new mileage records 
rules make that advice obsolete. Today, you should drive two cars for busi -
ness when that increases your deductions. 
Technical point:  Will the IRS allow use of more than one car for busi -
ness? Yes! The IRS official method for computing business car use is busi -
ness miles divided by total miles.21 In fact, the IRS recognizes in its Form 
2106 that taxpayers may drive two or more separate cars for business dur -
ing a tax year. Actually, if you drive more than two cars, the IRS has you 
attach a continuation sheet to your tax return. 
Calculate benefits:  To see if you can benefit, and by how much, make 
the computation that appears below . In this example, the taxpayer gains a 
minimum of $7,677 in “found” deductions with the two-car strategy. The 
added deductions come from depreciation and/or loss on sale. If the tax -
payer uses the actual expense method to calculate car deductions, he may 
gain more deductions than depreciation.

 185NotesBuild Audit-Proof Support of Your Mileage the 
Easy Way
Proof required:  You must prove your business car’s:22 
l Mileage
l Cost or other basis
l Actual expenses (if you use the actual-expense method)
How to accumulate proof:  You should:
l Record your entries in an account book, diary, log, statement of ex -
pense, trip sheet, or similar record. 
l Support your entries with receipts and other corroborating docu -
ments.23 
You must make entries in your log book at or near the time you incur the 
expenses or use the car.24 
Weekly log:  You may keep your log weekly. A weekly log meets the “at or 
near the time of the expense or use” rule.25 
Receipt rule:  You do not need to record receipt information in your log 
if:26
l You have the receipts 
l Your log and receipts complement each other
l You keep orderly records
As a practical matter, you avoid loss of deductions when you record re -
ceipt information on the same pages with mileage information. It presents 
a much better picture to the IRS auditor and shows that you know how to 
keep good records.
Recording mileage:  Your adequate record must prove business use. Detail 
varies. If you use your car to make 12 business stops in one day, you may 
or may not record each stop. If you contacted 12 different prospects, your 
appointment book should contain the 12 names. If you sell real estate and 
take your prospect to look at 12 homes, your diary entry might contain 
the prospect’s name and mileage to “look at 12 homes.” The IRS allows a 
single entry to account for a round trip or a series of uninterrupted busi -
ness stops.27
Ninety-day sample:  The IRS allows you to keep a 90-day log for a typi -
cal portion of the year to prove business use for the whole year.28 To use 
the 90-day test, you must have collateral support for the rest of the year. 
For example, your appointment book can confirm that your business use 
during the 275-day nontest period is comparable to the 90-day test period. 
With the 90-day sample and similar pattern for the non-90-day use, you 
prove your business use for the year. 
186NotesOne-week-a-month sample:  If your business use varies by season and the 
90-day test would not work for you, you should consider the one-week-a-
month test. Under this test, you pick one week a month—say the second 
week of each month—and you keep your log during that week. You may 
use the weeks to prove your business mileage, assuming your appointment 
book and other corroborative evidence prove that the weeks typify your 
driving patterns.29
Receipts needed:  You must prove amounts spent for gas and oil, repairs 
and maintenance, etc. You do not need receipts if the expense is less than 
$75.30 However, we recommend that you obtain receipts whenever practi -
cal. Remember, receipts corroborate other entries, such as the ones in your 
diary. 
Receipts alone are not enough:  You need more than receipts to prove 
business miles. Langer tried to use only receipts to justify his car deduc -
tion. The IRS said, “No!” Langer did not keep track of his miles or record 
the days or locations of his business trips. The gas receipts did not show 
the time, place, or business purposes for his trips. The court ruled that 
Langer’s receipts were not adequate records. The receipts alone provided 
no way to figure business-use percentage.31
Canceled checks:  A canceled check alone does not prove business cost.32 
You prove business cost when you support your canceled check with other 
evidence, such as a receipt, to show that you wrote the check for a busi -
ness purpose.33
Proof of cost:  You prove the cost of your car with your purchase receipts. 
You should have a copy of the dealer’s invoice to prove how much you 
paid for the car. You should have a canceled check to prove that you spent 
your money for your car. 
Proof of basis:  Basis is much more complex. To prove your basis, you 
need to keep: 
l Receipts and purchase records for all car purchases and trades
l Old tax returns, because they prove depreciation
l Old mileage logs, because they prove business-use percentages
l A copy of the blue book page that shows your car’s initial tax value 
If you converted a personal car to business use, you must be able to calcu -
late your car’s adjusted basis. You need it to report gain or loss on sale of 
the car,34 even if you use the IRS standard mileage rate.35 
Trades:  When you trade your old business car for a replacement, you need 
purchase documents that prove monies spent for both the old and new 
cars. For recent trades of business cars, you should file IRS Form 8824 to 
report the trades to the IRS.
 187NotesChecklist:  Good car records ensure your business-car deductions. Make it 
a habit to keep good car records. You have good records when you have:
l Invoices and receipts to support your payments
l Canceled checks to physically prove that you paid your bills
l Appointment books and records
l Mileage logs
l Old tax returns
If you charged gas and oil to a credit card, keep the invoices and receipts 
as support for the entries on the credit card statement. 
Final thought:  Think like an IRS auditor. Keep records that prove your 
case.

Ouch! Vehicle Totaled! Tax 
Benefits to Know
Wrecking your vehicle is never a good thing. But both wrecking your vehicle and 
missing out on your tax benefits is even worse. 
Corporations and individuals face the same rules on the business part of the 
totaled vehicle. But on the personal-use part of the vehicle, 
the individual has a personal casualty loss, whereas  l
the corporation has no personal part. It has a 100 percent business vehicle. l
Involuntary Conversion
Tax law calls the wreckage and totaling of your vehicle both an involuntary con -
version and a casualty. Apt descriptions!
The Insurance Check
When you have insurance and you total your vehicle, the insurance company will 
keep the vehicle and give you or your corporation a check for the pre-accident 
value of the vehicle.
If the check is made out to you because you operate your business as a  l
Schedule C taxpayer and you are the owner of the vehicle, you divide the 
insurance proceeds between business and personal use based on mileage.
If the check is made out to the corporation, you make no division between  l
business and personal use. On the corporate books, the vehicle is a business 
vehicle—period.
Gain or Loss—Proprietorship
Say you owned the vehicle for three years and drove it 20,000 miles for business 
and 5,000 miles for personal use during that three-year period. This gives you 80 
percent business use from the date of purchase to the wrecking of the vehicle.
As a proprietorship, you now divide the insurance proceeds according to business 
and personal use and compare that with your business and personal bases to find 
gain or loss, as in the following table:
Total Business Personal
Insurance proceeds $20,000 $16,000 $4,000
Adjusted basis1N/A $5,000 $8,000
Gain or loss N/A $11,000 -$4,000
 189Notes
As a Schedule C taxpayer, here are three things to know about the chart 
above:
Regardless of how you deduct your vehicle (actual expense method or IRS  l
mileage rates), you have adjusted basis, and thus gain or loss.
On the business part, you have either a taxable gain or a deductible loss. l
On the personal part, you pay taxes on any gain, but you may not deduct  l
any personal loss.
Gain or Loss—Corporation
If your corporation owns the vehicle and you use the vehicle for both business 
and personal purposes, the corporation assigns a value to your personal use and 
either that value goes on your W-2 or you reimburse that value to the corpora -
tion.
For purposes of depreciation and gain or loss, the corporation owns 100 percent 
of the vehicle. Using the numbers from the example above with business use now 
at 100 percent, you calculate the gain or loss as follows:
Insurance proceeds $20,000
Less adjusted basis $6,250
Gain $13,750
Defer the Business Gain
The proprietorship has a business gain of $11,000 and the corporation has a 
business gain of $13,750. Most business gains on vehicles come about because of 
depreciation and expensing deductions that you or your corporation claimed on 
the vehicle.
When the gain results because of the vehicle deductions, you have what’s known 
as recapture income, and that recapture income is taxed at ordinary income tax 
rates.
That’s what’s happening in our example—recapture tax, meaning ordinary in -
come taxes on both the $11,000 for the proprietor and the $13,750 for the corpo -
ration. Both likely want to avoid that. And both can do just that—avoid (actually 
defer) the taxes!
You have the option to choose deferral of this gain by replacing the vehicle with 
like-kind property. The law gives you a two-year window for the replacement, 
beginning the day of the wreck and ending two years later.2
Like-Kind Property
With respect to vehicles, like-kind property includes cars, light general-pur -
pose trucks (for use on the road and having actual unloaded weight of less 
than 13,000 pounds), and vehicles that share characteristics of both cars 
190Notes
and light general-purpose trucks (e.g., crossovers, sport utility vehicles, minivans, 
cargo vans, and similar vehicles).3 For more on this new development, see Sec -
tion 25, Avoid Taxes with Section 1031 Exchanges of Vehicles.
To defer all the gain, you need to invest the entire insurance proceeds in the new 
vehicle. If you invest less, you have taxable gain to the extent of your failure to 
reinvest.4
Example.  You wrecked your SUV last week, and you now invest the $20,000 
insurance proceeds in a new car. Presto, you owe no taxes on the business gain. 
The corporation gets the same treatment.
But if you reinvest only $16,000, you have taxable gain of $4,000.
Disclose the Deferral on Your Tax Return
To defer the gain, attach a statement to your personal Form 1040 or to the corpo -
rate tax return that discloses5
the date and details of the wreck; l
the insurance reimbursement; l
how the gain is calculated; l
the replacement property; l
the amount of the gain postponed; l
the adjusted basis on the replacement vehicle (as reduced by the deferral of  l
gain); and 
how much of the gain, if any, is taxable. l
Personal Loss
If you file your business taxes on Schedule C of your Form 1040, you treat the 
personal part of your wrecked auto as a personal casualty loss. Under the person -
al casualty loss rules, you deduct the lower of your cost or the fair market value, 
less the insurance proceeds.
If you have insurance, it’s likely that you will not have a casualty loss deduction 
on the personal part, because the insurance company will reimburse you the fair 
market value, less your deductible.
In the example above, you had an $8,000 personal cost (20 percent of $40,000) 
and a $4,000 fair market value—the value that the insurance company reim -
bursed. Thus, in this case, you have no personal casualty loss deduction because 
your fair value equals the insurance reimbursement.6
What if the insurance has a deductible? It’s highly unlikely that any deductible 
will produce a tax-deductible personal loss deduction, because tax law
reduces the amount of each casualty loss by $100, l7 and then
allows casualty losses only to the extent such losses exceed 10 percent of  l
adjusted gross income.8
 191Notes
Example. You have a $1,000 deductible on the above insurance policy. Your per-
sonal loss portion is $200 (20 percent personal use times $1,000). Next, subtract 
$100 and then disallow any amount that’s less than 10 percent of your adjusted 
gross income. In this example, with adjusted gross income of only $1,000, tax 
law eliminates the remaining $100 of your personal casualty loss deduction 
caused by the insurance deductible.
Business Loss
If the calculation shows that you have a business loss on the wreck, you want to 
deduct that business loss right this minute. That’s easy. Report the business loss 
as a business casualty loss. Deducting the business loss immediately is the right 
choice for both the corporation and the Schedule C business.
Why You Can Smile
Wrecking your vehicle is never a pleasant experience, but you have to admit that 
knowing you can defer taxes on the insurance proceeds that can cause a taxable 
gain is money-saving information. 
Further, this is pretty much a straightforward process when you know the basics, 
as you now do.
Endnotes—Section 29
1.  In the absence of a trade, basis is original cost plus improvements minus depre -
ciation. In this case, you bought a vehicle for $40,000 and allocated its purchase 
price 80 percent to business use and 20 percent to personal use. On the busi -
ness part, you depreciated the vehicle, and at the time of the wreck its basis was 
$5,000. On the personal part, the basis is 20 percent of the $40,000, or $8,000. In 
a trade, you determine basis using the rules for Section 1031 exchanges.

Commission Rebate Deductions 
Allowed
Robert Corrigan worked as a stockbroker for Smith Barney. In two years, 
Corrigan earned $1,403,005 in commissions and rebated $424,926 to one 
of his clients, JLB Capital. He contended that the rebates were necessary 
to induce purchases of certain syndicated stock. 
The court noted that it is not unusual for brokerage firms that offer syn -
dicated stock to accept reduced commissions, because commissions for 
syndicated stock transactions are generally larger than those for other 
stock transactions. On the front of his Form 1040, Corrigan reported his 
gross W-2 commissions, deducted the rebates against those commissions, 
and reported his net commissions. 
At trial, the IRS brought up several issues regarding the rebates, including 
these:
l The rebates, if deductible, would be deductible only as an employee 
business expense and not as an offset against income as Corrigan had 
claimed on his tax return.
l The rebates may violate California securities law .
l The rebates may result in disciplinary action or suspension by the 
New York Stock Exchange.
l The rebates are not deductible by Corrigan because the commissions 
were paid to Smith Barney.
The court ruled as follows:1
l Corrigan may not deduct the rebates as an offset to his commissions.
l Corrigan qualifies to deduct the rebates as employee business 
expenses.
l The rebates are ordinary and necessary business expenses under the 
law .
l Tax law does not make the rebates “illegal” as set forth in Section 
162(c)(2).
l The IRS failed not only to assert, but also to prove as required by law, 
that the rebates are illegal payments barred from deduction.
Planning note 1:  Corrigan’s status as an employee puts his rebate deduc -
tions in jeopardy. As instructed by the court, he deducts the rebates as 
“employee business expenses” in the miscellaneous deduction category, 
194Noteswhere they are not deductible under the Alternative Minimum Tax 
(AMT). 
Planning note 2:  The AMT will cost Corrigan about $50,000 for his re -
bates. Had Corrigan been an independent contractor rather than an em -
ployee, his AMT would have been zero. 
Definition of illegal payments:  Section 162(c)(2) states that you may not 
deduct any payment that constitutes an illegal bribe, illegal kickback, or 
other illegal payment under any law of the United States, or under any 
law of a state (but only if such state law is generally enforced), where such 
payment would subject you to criminal penalty or loss of license or privi -
lege to engage in the business. Kickbacks include payments for referrals. 
Unlike most sections of the tax law, where you carry the burden of proof, 
here the IRS bears the burden to prove that the payments are illegal and 
not deductible.

Section 31
Save Big Tax Dollars—Hire Your 
Dependent Children
Overview:  The IRS acknowledges that a proprietor’s child over the age of 
6 may be a bona fide employee.1 Tax law says that wages paid by parents 
to children under age 18 are exempt from payroll taxes.2 Do you operate 
your business as
l an independent contractor?
l a sole proprietor?
l an employee?
If you answer “yes” to any of the three, you have a tax-planning opportu -
nity with your children who are over age 6 and under age 18.
Caution:  You do not get any payroll tax breaks if your child is hired by
l your corporation, or
l your partnership (unless each partner is a parent of the child).
However, you and your child still benefit to the extent your tax bracket 
exceeds the payroll tax cost. Thus, if your combined federal and state tax 
bracket is 50 percent and the payroll tax on the child’s wage is 20 percent, 
your family saves 30 percent on money paid to the child.
Maximum benefits: The biggest benefits go to individuals who file Sched -
ule C and can employ their dependent children. 
The law:  Tax law allows a deduction for your ordinary and necessary 
business expenses, including wages paid to others for personal services 
rendered to your business.3 You may deduct compensation only when it is4
l reasonable in amount,
l based on services actually rendered, and
l actually paid.
Wages to children:  The IRS says that you may deduct wages paid to your 
dependent child when the facts show that your child5
l did the work as a bona fide employee in the operation of your busi -
ness, and
l received reasonable compensation for the work effort.

 197NotesThe IRS noted that a parent may employ his child just as he can employ 
someone else’s child. The IRS made it clear that it would not be rational 
to penalize the taxpayer who employs his dependent child.6
Extra scrutiny:  The courts note that payments by a parent to a dependent 
child require careful scrutiny.7 Because of the family relationship, the court 
needs to take a close look to make sure there is both a bona fide employer–
employee relationship and performance of services for the business.8 
One court noted that transactions among family members must clear the 
tax law hurdle that does not allow deductions for personal, living, or fam -
ily expense.9 Another court noted that tax law10
l taxes income to the person who earns it, and
l disregards devices to divert or assign income from the person who 
earns it to another. 
Caution:  Your child’s employment must be bona fide. Moreover, you must 
be able to prove it. 
Benefits:  You benefit when you pay your child who is under age 18 
because:
l You get a tax deduction for wages you pay the child. This tax deduc -
tion reduces both your income and self-employment taxes.
l Both you and your child are exempt from payroll taxes.11 
l Your child pays zero income tax on his or her 2017 earnings up to the 
standard deduction amount of $6,350.12
l Your child can make a deductible contribution of up to $5,500 to an 
IRA.13
l Your child may take funds from his or her IRA to pay for college with -
out incurring the 10 percent penalty tax.14 
l Your child pays tax of only 10 percent on 2017 taxable income of less 
than $9,325.15
Example 1:  You earn $90,000 net (after expenses), report it on Schedule C 
of your tax return, and live in a state that has no income tax. You employ 
your two under-age-18 children, paying them each $5,000 a year. You de -
duct $10,000 and save almost $4,000 on your combined self-employment 
and income taxes. Your children pay zero tax. Thus, the family savings are 
almost $4,000.16
Child’s money: The children may use their wages for whatever they want. 
It is their money. They can even pay part of their own support without 
impairing the parent’s deduction for the wages.17
198NotesValue of food and lodging:  The value of meals and lodging may not be 
considered wages by the parents, because parents are legally liable for 
support and maintenance of their minor children.18 Thus, where food and 
lodging furnished to a third-party employee might be a deduction, it is not 
a deduction when furnished to your minor children, no matter how bona 
fide the business relationship.
Example 2:  After expenses, you net $101,000 in your Schedule C business 
and your spouse earns $350,000 on a W-2. You pay your 16-year-old child 
$20,000 for his work in your business during the year. Your child claims 
the full $5,500 IRA deduction because he plans to use the IRA money for 
college during those years when his tax bracket is going to be zero. 
You and your son live in a state with no income tax. Your son reports 
his wages of $20,000 and claims the standard deduction and a deduction 
for his IRA contribution. His net income tax is $820 on his $20,000 of 
wages. Because of your $20,000 deduction for wages to your son, you and 
your spouse save $10,746 in taxes (39.6 percent in federal taxes and 14.13 
percent in net self-employment taxes—15.3 percent x 0.9235). Your family 
saves $9,926 in taxes. 
Money for college:  If your son uses the money for college, it is as if you 
got an $9,926 tax break for your child’s college tuition. That is a great ben -
efit, and in addition, you get to work with someone you know and love.
Advantages:  By hiring your children, you get more individual and family 
benefits than you would by hiring an outsider. There are four major advan -
tages:
1. You do not pay Social Security taxes on the wages you pay to a depen -
dent who is under age 18.19 
2. You do not pay unemployment taxes on the wages you pay your 
under-age-21 child.20
3. Your child does not pay taxes on the first $6,350 of wages earned and 
then pays tax at only 10 percent on the first $9,325 of taxable income.21
4. The family money supply grows in direct proportion to the net taxes 
saved.
In effect, you can look at the tax savings as a form of tuition tax credit.
Good “shoebox” needed:  The IRS does not pay its auditors to believe 
that your children are actually working for you. In fact, the IRS tells its 
auditors to look harder at transactions between you and your dependent 
children. It expects you to have proof! It expects its auditors to ask you for 
the proof.
 199NotesProof is easy:  Here are six easy steps to excellent proof:
l Get an employer ID.
l Require time sheets.
l Document the reasonable wage.
l Pay by check.
l Complete the payroll paperwork.
l Apply common sense.
Get an employer ID:  If your kids work for you, you must first set yourself 
up as an employer. That starts with your employer identication number 
(EIN). You may obtain your EIN 
online at www .irs.gov ,  l
by calling the IRS at (800) 829-4933, or l
by completing IRS Form SS-4. l
Require a time sheet:  You should collect completed time sheets on a daily 
or weekly basis. You should require your children and other part-time em -
ployees to complete time sheets according to your schedule. (Often, with 
kids under 10 years old, it is best to get daily time sheets and pay the kids 
daily to keep them motivated.)TIME SHEET
Name: Your Child
Date Description of Work Completed Hours
7/10/08  Web site design 2
7/11/08 Web site design 2
7/12/08 Web site design 5
Total Hours Worked 9
Rate of Pay per Hour 38
Gross Pay from This Time Sheet 342
200NotesIn any event, you should require a time sheet to prove that your child did 
the work and to show how long it took. Review the time sheet example on 
the previous page, and use it as a guide for designing your own. Note how 
it documents the date, task, and time spent working.
The IRS will disallow your wage deduction if you do not prove that the 
children did the work. Vernon E. Martens hired his two sons and two 
daughters, but he lost about 80 percent of his deductions because he did 
not require time sheets.22 
Document the reasonable wage:  Next, you have to prove that the wage 
you pay your dependent child is not too high. You need proof that the 
wage is equal to what you would pay a third party to do the work.
Example:  You pay your son $15.50 an hour to do your monthly promo -
tional mailing. He produces 60 units an hour. You tried your neighbor and 
paid her $16.00 an hour, but she produced only 47 units an hour. You tried 
a $22.75-an-hour worker from a temporary employment agency, but he 
produced only 43 units an hour. 
You need to document the wages paid to your neighbor and the fee paid 
to the temporary help agency. You should record the units produced and 
perhaps have the neighbor and temporary-help person sign statements of 
production. 
Remember, you must have proof:  The IRS considers written statements 
at or near the time you pay your neighbor far more important than state -
ments made later, when both you and your neighbor have less chance of 
accurate recall. 
When your neighbor signs the time sheet, make sure the description 
includes the number of items mailed. When you combine the time sheet 
with your summary, you have very convincing evidence.
You can build reasonable support for the wage you pay your minor child 
if you build a written answer to the question: Why am I paying my child 
this amount? Once you put your answer in writing, file it with your tax 
records. 
Pay by check:  Always pay wages by payroll check. You create a business 
image when you pay your child like you pay other employees. Also, you 
need to establish a clear audit trail from your business checkbook to your 
child’s savings or money market account. 
 201NotesNew Regulations on Employing Your Children
The Department of Labor recently issued new regulations on employing 
your children. You can find the new rules at the department’s interactive 
web site: www.dol.gov/elaw s. 
Your 15-year-old or younger child may work for you, the parent, for any 
number of hours at any time of day. However, you may not employ your 
child in mining, manufacturing, or occupations declared hazardous (enu -
merated on the web site).
When you hire your children to work in your business, it is probably not 
so you can work them to death. It’s likely that your goal is to pay them all 
you can so they will have money for college but still have time to learn and 
develop while they’re in grade school and high school. Try to find work 
tasks that pay a lot so your children can earn money for college but still 
have plenty of time to be children. 
Complete the Payroll Paperwork
You must complete the dreaded payroll paperwork. If your child will be 
your first and only employee, you will find the payroll paperwork a ma -
jor and disgusting hurdle in the hire-your-child strategy. Do not fret! You 
could:
l Hire your child to take care of the paperwork, or 
l Hire a payroll service like ADP , Paychex, or Payroll One Solutions.
To find a payroll service, ask your accountant or look in the Yellow Pages 
under “Payroll Services.” Also, consider the Internet, where QuickBooks 
has an online payroll service that costs about $25 a month. Costco recently 
had a QuickBooks payroll special at $12.95 a month.
If you hire your child as the employee in charge of payroll, you have more 
business chores that your child can complete.
If you choose the payroll service, you will have an extra $155 to $700 in 
expenses for the year, but the service will take care of the payroll paper -
work, including
l automatically taking any tax money due out of your bank account 
and sending it to the IRS; and
l automatically preparing each IRS form, such as the W-2, and filing it 
with the proper taxing authorities.
Federal payroll forms that you will need include the following:
l IRS Form W-4: Your child will use this form to tell you how many 
exemptions and allowances he or she claims.Remember, your wage 
payments to your under 
age 18 children are 
free of payroll taxes, 
but could be subject to 
withholding.
202Notesl IRS Form W-2: If you paid your child $600 or more in wages, you 
must provide your child with a copy of IRS Form W-2. You file IRS 
Form W-3 and copies of the W-2s with the Social Security Adminis -
tration.
l IRS Form 941: If you pay periodically, you file this form each quarter. 
If your child is your only employee, you enter zero as the amount sub -
ject to Social Security tax. If you pay wages once a year, you file Form 
941 on a “seasonal” basis—once a year.
l IRS Form 940: The wages you pay your under-age-21 child are ex -
empt from unemployment taxes. Even so, you must file IRS Form 
940. If your child is your only employee, you enter the amounts paid 
to your child as both (1) gross pay and (2) exempt pay, making a net 
pay of zero subject to federal unemployment tax. 
Apply common sense:  Besides the payroll paperwork, you need to use 
common sense. How young can your child be and still do the work? Ac -
cording to the IRS, any child over age 6 can be a bona fide employee.23 For 
peace of mind, you may want to use the IRS-approved age of over 6 years 
old as the minimum age for your hire.
One final thought:  When you pay your child, the money is your child’s 
money. If your child is a minor, you may be the custodian, but remember 
to exercise your fiduciary responsibilities and protect your child’s money 
for the child’s benefit.

Section 32
Solo 401(k) Could Be the Perfect 
Retirement Plan
In spite of recent headlines about the housing market, a revealing statistic 
shows that in the United States people have most of their net worth in 
their homes. The home captures wealth in spite of people. 
This makes sense. Unlike bank accounts, stock portfolios, or most other 
places you can store your funds, you cannot quickly withdraw money from 
your home. So, while your other accounts ebb and flow, depending on 
immediate needs, your home captures wealth and imprisons it for the long 
term. Thinking long term is a good thing. 
If you have no employees and you or you and your spouse are the own -
ers of a business, new rules make the solo 401(k) another highly desirable 
capture mechanism for the following reasons:
You get an individual tax deduction for the money you put into the  l
plan.
Your business gets a tax deduction for the money it puts into the plan.  l
The money in the plan grows tax-deferred. l
Strict rules limit when you can touch (tamper with) it. l
This adds up to a capture mechanism with great long-term benefits. 
If you have employees, you need to consider them in your plan design; but 
if you don’t, you need consider only yourself. 
That’s what this section does. It considers only you. It shows you how to 
put away up to and likely a little more than $59,000 for retirement with
zero administrative cost, and  l
very little tax hassle. l
The $59,000 is the 2015 amount and it’s indexed for inflation. Expect the 
2016 amount to stay the same or increase slightly. Check www .bradfor -
dandcompany.com/2016 for the final 2016 indexed amount.
If you, or you and your spouse, own the business, you can have a solo 
401(k) whether your business is incorporated or unincorporated. This 
includes businesses you operate as C corporations, S corporations, single-
member LLCs, husband and wife LLCs, partnerships, and proprietorships. If you have employees, 
this section gives a great 
overview of strategies. 
Finish this section. Then, 
speak with your advisor 
about a “target” plan that 
will produce the results 
you want. 
Your 401(k) plan may 
exclude employees who 
have not completed a 
year of service (generally 
1,000 hours of service). 
IRC Sections 401(a)(1)(A)
(ii) and 410(a)(3)(A).
 203Notes
Socking the Money Away
The biggest deal in today’s solo 401(k) is that the new law allows you to 
sock away and deduct far more money than in the past. Prior law had big 
restrictions on how much you could put into a solo 401(k) that made it a 
far less desirable plan. Today, the enhanced ceilings on the solo 401(k) al -
low
the  l employee  deduction for a contribution of 100 percent of your first 
$18,000 in earnings1 ($24,000 if you are age 50 or over2), plus 
the  l employer  deduction for a contribution of 20 percent of your self-
employment income3 (or 25 percent of compensation if you operate 
as a corporation4). 
Example:  You are 53 years old and your self-employment income is 
$90,000. 
With your 1. employee  contribution, you may put away and deduct 
$24,000. 
With your 2. employer  contribution, you may put away and deduct 
$18,000—that’s 20 percent of your $90,000 of self-employment in -
come. 
Thus, at age 53 with earnings of $90,000, you can sock away and deduct 
$42,000. 
Limits.  The law imposes an overall ceiling on the combined employer and 
employee 2017 401(k) deductions and contributions of 
$54,000 if you are under age 50, and  l
$60,000 if you are age 50 or over.  l
That’s a tidy chunk. 
Tax deferral.  Two big deals with the 401(k) retirement plan are the tax 
deductions for the monies put into the plan and the tax-deferred growth 
of the money inside the plan. Growing money at 8 percent or 12 percent 
is far superior to growing money at 5 percent or 7 percent. Tax deferral al -
lows growth at the higher number.
Start early , earn a lot. You put away $40,000 for 21 years. Your tax-
deferred compounding accumulation at 8 percent is $2.18 million.5 That’s 
a hefty amount. But if you could earn 9 percent, you would have an extra 
$300,000, for a total of $2.48 million. Add four more years and you’d have 
$3.69 million. So start your plan now; keep it for a long time; and get a 
good rate of return.The Dow Jones Industrial 
average increased at an 
average compound rate 
of 9.21 percent from 
January 1, 1982 ($882) 
to November 3, 2016 
($17,931). Add about 3 
percent for dividends and 
you have about 12 percent 
as the average annual 
compound rate of return. 
That average annual 12 
percent return would 
make for a GREAT retire-
ment plan.
204Notes
Unlike the simplified employee pension (SEP) where you contribute at the 
rate of 25 percent of earnings,6 the 401(k) allows you to sock away 100 
percent of the first $18,000 in earnings ($24,000, if you are 50 or older). 
Example:  Bill’s wife, Andrea, makes big bucks and has a retirement plan 
at her company. Bill is just starting his self-employment, but he managed 
to squeak out $11,000 of proprietorship income. Bill may contribute the 
entire $11,000 to his 401(k) plan. 
The Flexibility Advantage
The solo 401(k) has the great advantage of not requiring annual contribu -
tions—you decide each year how much you want to contribute. You are 
not locked into a fixed amount, and you can skip years whenever you like.
Further, you may contribute less than the tax law allows. If cash is tight 
and you don’t want to make the 20 percent self-employment contribution, 
you can contribute 11 percent, 3 percent, or nothing at all. The choice is 
yours.
The total flexibility of the solo 401(k) is one of its many attractive features.
Set Up Your Plan Now
Since you must have your 401(k) in place by the end of the year, you 
might as well start this very day. In addition, you should make your em -
ployee contribution of up to $18,000 ($24,000 if you are 50 or older) 
before the end of your business year.7 
Don’t procrastinate.  If you wait, your money does not start working. You 
want your money working in a tax-favored environment at the earliest pos -
sible moment. 
No-Fee Setup 
Charles Schwab and Fidelity do not charge account service fees for solo or 
individual 401(k) accounts. 
Of the many brokerage accounts we examined, we found fees that vary 
widely, from zero at firms like Charles Schwab to as much as $1,500 a 
year. That’s a big difference. Make sure you do a little research here. Note: under a SIMPLE plan, 
your elective under age 50 
deferral limit is $12,000. 
Under the 401(k), it’s 
$18,000.
 205Notes
Filing the Form 5500 EZ
When your 401(k) plan balance exceeds $250,000, you must file IRS Form 
5500-EZ.8 Although the form is straightforward, you probably should have 
your tax preparer complete it for you. Some plan administrators provide a 
service whereby they do the 5500-EZs for a fee.
Do not make the mistake of not filing this form. Because you are not re -
quired to file the form until your plan balance exceeds $250,000, it is easy 
to miss the deadline, especially in the first year you have to file it. Depend -
ing on your plan contributions and the earnings in your plan, you won’t 
have to file this tax form for at least the first two years. Make a note of the 
deadline so you don’t miss it. 
The penalty for failing to file Form 5500-EZ is $25 a day.9 That doesn’t 
sound like a lot until you consider that in just one year the $25 daily pen -
alty grows to a whopping $9,125. Further, the penalty is not deductible.
In what must have been a weak moment, lawmakers put a $15,000 maxi -
mum lid on the $25-a-day penalty. 
Avoid the penalty .  Make sure you have the filing deadline for this form on 
your calendar. You have until the last day of the seventh calendar month 
after the end of the plan year to file the return. For the plan year ending 
December 31, 2017, you have until July 31, 2018. That’s plenty of time for 
this easy-to-file return. 
Rollovers
When you establish your 401(k) account, you may roll over your existing 
pensions, IRAs, or other tax-deferred retirement accounts into the new 
401(k).10
Similarly, when you decide to close down your 401(k), you can put togeth -
er a rollover to your IRA.11
When you’re doing a rollover, follow this general keep-out-of-trouble rule: 
Use a trustee-to-trustee rollover. The trustee-to-trustee rollover (e.g., from 
a Schwab to a Fidelity account)
keeps the money out of your hands,  l
avoids the tax withholding rules, l
ensures that all monies are properly transferred, and  l
uses the services of professionals to help you avoid mistakes.  l
206Notes
The Borrowing Booby Trap 
Because you are the sole participant in the plan, the law treats you as a key 
employee.12 Your key-employee status makes your 401(k) plan top-heavy, 
and that precludes deductions for interest paid on a 401(k) loan.
You will see ads explaining that one of the many great attributes of the 
solo 401(k) is the fact that you can borrow up to the lesser of $50,000 or 50 
percent of the balance. The ads explain that many people roll their existing 
pensions and IRAs over to a 401(k) and, because they can borrow from it, 
have less fear of going into business for themselves.
This is absolute baloney. First, the ability to borrow from your 401(k) is 
probably the last reason on earth that you are going into business for your -
self. Second, your key-employee status makes borrowing from your 401(k) 
a mistake, because you cannot deduct the interest. 
Here is how borrowing from your solo 401(k) works, step by step, and why 
you make a sad mistake when you borrow: 
You borrow money from the 401(k)—you now have the cash.  l
You must repay the principal and interest on a business 401(k) loan  l
within five years.13—you don’t have the cash for very long. 
Because you are a key employee, you may not claim a tax deduction  l
for the interest you pay on the 401(k) loan.14
When your 401(k) distributes to you the interest on which you  l
claimed no deduction, you have taxable income.
You are booby-trapped here. You get no deduction for the interest that you 
pay to the 401(k), but you pay taxes on that interest as you collect retire -
ment money from your 401(k). 
Planning tip.  If you need cash for your business, have your business 
obtain the cash from a source other than your 401(k). That way your busi -
ness may deduct the interest.
Example.  You are a sole proprietor in the 31 percent tax bracket. You 
borrow money at 8 percent interest from an outside source—not your 
401(k)—for use in the proprietorship. Because you may deduct the inter -
est, your after-tax cost of this money is only 5.52 percent. Deductions 
reduce your cost of money and help build your net worth. 
 207Notes
Steps to Set Up Your Solo 401(k) Plan
Remember, when you have a solo 401(k) plan in either your proprietorship 
or corporation, you are two entities for plan purposes: You are both the 
employee and the employer. Keep your two entities in mind and follow the 
steps below to put your solo 401(k) plan in place.
1. Decide where to put the money. You want a high rate of investment 
return; low rates can render the retirement benefits of your 401(k) useless.
2. Put your plan in place now . The law requires that your 401(k) plan be in 
place before the end of your business year (that’s probably December 31). 
3. Deposit your employee contribution of up to $18,000 ($24,000 if you 
are age 50 or older) today. There are two reasons to make the deposit to -
day. First, you must make your employee contribution by the end of your 
personal tax year (probably December 31). Second, the sooner you put the 
money into the 401(k), the longer it compounds and grows tax-deferred.
4. Deposit your employer contribution of 20 percent if you operate as a 
proprietorship or 25 percent if you operate as a corporation. Do it now . 
Today. Don’t wait. (The law gives you the ability to later correct excess 
contributions.) 
5. File IRS Form 5500-EZ when your 401(k) assets at the end of a plan 
year exceed $250,000.
Summary
The solo 401(k) plan is catching on. Although the solo 401(k) has been in 
this new, enhanced mode for only a few years, you can find many offer -
ings and investment opportunities on the Web. To search, try these short 
phrases in quotes: “solo 401(k)” and “individual 401(k).” 
Don’t limit your search to the Web. Speak with your financial and tax 
advisors. Because your advisors have many clients with 401(k) questions,

To make the plan produce a strong result, you need a strong rate of invest -

Tips for Building Audit-Proof 
Support
Proof embedded in this course:  You probably noted while reading various 
sections of this book the good records recommended within the sections. 
This section is an overview that complements the other proof discussions. 
Appointment book is focal point:  Build your documentation system 
around your appointment book. Note in the chart below how your ap -
pointments create a line of reasoning to your activities and expenditures. 
212NotesKeep a Happy “Shoebox”
Shoebox:  The shoebox is simply your storage place for receipts and other 
documentary evidence. It may be a file cabinet, box, or even a real shoe -
box. If you fail to keep adequate receipts, you lose deductions.1
Happy shoebox:  Keep your shoebox happy by giving it receipts, canceled 
checks, invoices, charge slips, correspondence, log books, photographs, 
and other corroborative evidence. Remember: Pack rats pay less tax.
Make Your Diary Love Your Shoebox
Diary:  For all practical purposes, tax law requires you to keep a diary 
(your appointment book enhanced) to prove ordinary and necessary busi -
ness activity.2
Diary and shoebox need to agree:  A good diary/shoebox system requires 
that you support entries in a diary with receipts and other corroborative 
evidence. Sanford, a taxpayer, lost his deductions for travel expenses that 
were $75 or more because he did not have receipts in his shoebox.3 (Note: 
The old $25 threshold increased to $75 effective October 1, 1995.)4 You 
must gather evidence such as receipts to deduct lodging and expenses of 
$75 or more while out of town.5
Tricks for Your Checkbook
Canceled check:  A canceled check is not adequate documentation be -
cause it does not show the items making up the expenditure.6 You should 
have receipts, invoices, or other written evidence to prove expenses paid by 
check. The IRS tells its auditors to examine canceled checks with invoices 
to find the nature of expenditures and verify actual costs.7
Three-part voucher checks:  To ensure adequate support for business ex -
penditures, use three-part voucher checks.
l Part 1: Original goes to the vendor and ends up at your bank. Your 
bank should either return it to you or digitize it as part of your bank 
statement. Make sure you have either the canceled checks or digitized 
copies in your files at the office.
l Part 2: Attach copy 1 to the receipt, invoice, or other documentation 
that supports the payment and file alphabetically or by check number.
l Part 3: Numerical file copy. (In the days of computers, this seems re -
dundant, but it makes a good impression in an IRS audit and it takes 
only a minute to do.
 213NotesWhen to Make the Record
Timely recording:  Tax law states that written evidence is far superior to 
oral evidence. The probative value of written evidence is greater the closer 
in time the recording is to the expenditure. Tax law does not require a 
contemporaneous log. It says that a log of an expenditure’s elements, sup -
ported by sufficient documentary evidence, has a high degree of credibil -
ity—more credibility than that found in a statement prepared later, when 
generally there is a lack of accurate recall.8
Proving timely recording:  Use a credit card to record your entertainment 
and travel expenses. On the top copy of the credit card receipt, note the 
business purpose and other pertinent documentation. You produce one of 
two possible corroborative pieces of evidence with this method:
l A carbon copy that supports the original entry.
l An original that contains handwriting and ink that starts aging that 
day. With today’s science, experts can approximate the date of entry.
What the IRS Expects
Records examiners expect to find:  The IRS notes that taxpayers in per -
sonal services businesses have some or all of the following accounting and 
financial records:9
l Appointment book
l Customer or client card file
l Daily log or receipts book
l Disbursements book, such as a checkbook
l Running account of expenses paid
l Duplicate deposit slips, bank statements, and canceled checks
Think like a good auditor:  Tax evidence tells:
l How many people are sleeping in your room (lodging receipts show 
occupancy—single and double).
l Side trips you took (airline tickets show stops on the way to and from 
a business destination).
l Child’s use of business car (signatures on gasoline credit-card charge 
receipts can suggest use by family members other than the business 
taxpayer).
l Overstated auto mileage (repair bills establish mileage driven during 
the year).To visualize how the 
audit-proofing process

Choosing the Right Business 
Entity Can Be Critical to Your 
Business Health 
New Stimulus Law Adds Flavors to Choices
Being in business means facing two vultures:
l The legal system that puts your hard-earned assets at risk.
l The tax man who wants his share of your earnings.
Say the delivery man slips and falls on a banana peel left on the doorstep 
of your business location—which might be inside your home. Your per -
sonal assets could be at risk when he decides to sue for his disabling back 
injury.
How do you protect your personal assets? Well, you could operate your 
business as an entity that limits your liability to the assets of your business. 
The entity choices include S and C corporations and limited liability com -
panies (LLCs). Each of these entities forms a protective legal wall around 
your personal assets. Since most business-related liabilities can’t penetrate 
that wall, your personal assets should be safe from the delivery man’s as -
sault on your wealth. 
On the other hand, if you continue operating your business as a sole 
proprietorship or as a husband-wife partnership, you expose your personal 
assets to all business-related liabilities.
Once you conclude that you need a liability-limiting entity, the next step is 
to choose the appropriate kind. Now you have to consider the second vul -
ture. This is where the tax angles become important, because each entity 
involves different tax rules. You want the entity that delivers the best tax 
results for you. 
Also, because your business and personal circumstances change with time 
(marriage, children, employees), you need to revisit your choice of entity 
periodically to ensure maximum benefits.

 217NotesBefore we start kicking these vultures around, you need one more bit of 
global knowledge about liabilities. In general, no liability-limiting entity 
can protect your personal assets from your
l professional errors and omissions, or 
l tortious acts. (Tortious acts are things like reckless operation of an 
auto resulting in injuries or property damage to others.)
To protect your assets from exposure to professional and tort liabilities, 
you must conduct your business and personal life with due diligence and 
buy adequate insurance coverage. No surprises here! 
Next, you need to consider adding a second layer of protection by 
establishing a liability-limiting entity to shield your personal assets from 
business-related liabilities that might arise from things totally beyond your 
control, like 
l bad things done by an employee, or 
l the dreaded banana on your business doorstep. 
 
The series of sections that follow will help you defend yourself against 
both the legal and tax vultures by
l explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each entity, 
l showing you an ironclad way to get to the best bottom line for you, 
and
l putting a smile on your face as you see the dollar savings. 
The next section of this book deals with the single-member LLC, followed 
by one-owner S corporations, then one-owner C corporations, and finally 
considerations for the husband and wife.
On the left you see a chart of selected winners and losers for the entities. 
As you can see, many things can happen when you choose a business en -
tity. Some good! Some bad! How do you know what’s best?
There is one and only one way to know what’s best for you. Put pencil 
to paper and compare the forms of business and your after-tax cash. In 
general, we recommend that you and your tax advisor do this together. 
Further, you want this in writing for two major reasons:
1. An opinion in writing from your tax advisors carries great weight.
2. A written analysis is done with far more care than a casual off-the-cuff 
comment, which may not consider all the consequences.
Tax advisors enjoy opinion assignments. It gives them more chargeable 
time and it takes advantage of their training, which is the most enjoyable 
work.Selected Winners and Losers for Entity Choices
218NotesYou should clearly understand your written document. Suppose you asked 
your tax advisor to compare your current proprietorship to an S corpora -
ton. If he or she gave you the comparison that you see in the chart below, 
you would have a very good understanding of why your current propri -
etorship is best for you. 
Before looking at this chart, keep in mind that this is just a sample. Your 
answer could easily be the opposite of this result. Your result depends on 
your situation.

Section 35
Single-Member Limited Liability 
Companies (LLCs) Are Simple to 
Operate 
All states now allow single-member (one-owner) limited liability 
companies. Owners of LLCs are referred to as members . The 
single-member LLC provides
l liability protection, and
l maximum simplicity for tax purposes.
The single-member LLC offers corporate-style liability protection. This 
generally means that only assets owned by the single-member LLC are 
exposed to liabilities related to the LLC’s business activities. So, if you put 
no assets in the LLC, you have no real exposure. Further, with the LLC, 
your personal assets are generally off limits. Good! 
Single-member LLCs also deliver favorable federal income tax results. 
First, IRS regulations say that you ignore a single-member LLC for federal 
tax purposes.1 For example, say you set up a new single-member LLC to 
conduct what was previously your sole proprietorship business. As far as 
the IRS is concerned, nothing has changed; the IRS ignores the existence 
of your single-member LLC. So your business is still considered a sole 
proprietorship for federal tax purposes. Therefore, you continue
l reporting your business income and expenses on Schedule C, 
l computing your self-employment tax on Schedule SE, and
l making quarterly estimated tax payments as usual.
Now say you establish a new single-member LLC to take over your ex -
isting rental real estate operation. Once again, for federal tax purposes, 
the single-member LLC existence is ignored. You continue reporting the 
rental real estate income and expenses on Schedule E, and you keep mak -
ing quarterly estimated tax payments just as before. 
As you can see, extreme simplicity is the major tax advantage of single-
member LLC status. 
220NotesTax Breaks
The single-member LLC allows you to capture the tax breaks below that 
accrue to Schedule C businesses:
l Creating a Section 105 plan strategy by hiring your spouse and 
enabling business deductions for family medical expenses
l Deducting interest paid on car loans
l Incurring no extra cost for a second tax return
l Experiencing no unexpected tax problems when you conduct transac -
tions between yourself and your business (like taking money out of 
the single-member LLC’s business checking account, or transferring 
ownership of an asset between you and the single-member LLC).
Yes, keeping things simple is good!
Single-Member LLC Caveats 
Of course, nothing is perfect—including the single-member LLC. Here are 
the two significant downside considerations. 
First, when you use a single-member LLC to operate a trade or business, 
the member—meaning you—must pay the federal self-employment tax in 
the same fashion as a sole proprietor. Basically, you must multiply your 
bottom-line Schedule C net income by .9235 and pay 15.3 percent self-
employment taxes on earnings up to $113,700. 
The self-employment tax rate on income above $113,700 is 2.90 percent 
(this is for Medicare only). There’s no upper limit on the amount taxed at 
that 2.90 percent rate. Finally, you get no deduction for self-employment 
tax purposes for contributions to your tax-deferred retirement plan ac -
count because this deduction does not go on your Schedule C; instead, it 
goes on the front of your Form 1040.2
For example, if your Schedule C net income is $100,000, you pay self-
employment taxes of $14,130.3 That’s a lot of money! 
And this is not a one-time thing; your tax partner takes this money from 
you year after year. 
With a different choice of entity, and the will to put up with some heavy 
paperwork, you can seriously reduce the Social Security and Medicare tax 
hits with the S and C corporation options explained later. You actually pay 14.13% on a 
maximum of $123,119 (.9235 
of which is $113,700).
 221NotesAnother caution:  some states mistreat the single-member LLC and tax it 
not as a proprietorship, but as a corporation. Most jurisdictions follow the 
beneficial federal guidelines and ignore single-member LLCs for state tax 
purposes. In those states, you do not file a separate state return for your 
single-member LLC. 
However, a few states tax the single-member LLC like a corporation. For 
example, Texas imposes the corporate tax on a single-member LLC. This 
is pretty bad. Texas does not assess the income tax on the sole proprietor, 
so the corporate classification in Texas is a definite downside. Thus, it is 
important to know how your state addresses LLCs.
Summary on Single-Member LLCs 
With the single-member LLC arrangement, you get the liability protection 
you need with maximum federal tax simplicity (state tax simplicity too, in 
most jurisdictions). This is a great combination! However, you may pay a 
price in the form of higher Social Security and Medicare taxes. If you can 
live with that, we heartily recommend the single-member LLC option. 
On the other hand, if you are willing to incur more paperwork to pay less 
Social Security and Medicare taxes, you should consider the S and C cor -
poration options.

 223Notes Section 36
The One-Person S Corporation
In the preceding section, you learned how the single-member LLC could 
protect you from legal liability and keep your tax life simple. In the right 
circumstances, the single-member LLC is a better tax reduction choice 
than the S corporation or the C corporation. 
This section shows you when the S corporation is the best legal choice for 
your business. 
First, since the trigger for changing your form of business from a propri -
etorship is liability protection, you will be happy to learn that the solely 
owned S corporation does job one and protects you against business-
related liabilities. 
       
With an S corporation, you also qualify for pass-through taxation  for federal 
income tax purposes. Under this taxpayer-friendly concept, the law does 
not assess entity-level federal income taxes on the S corporation itself. 
Instead, all the corporation’s income, deductions, and tax credit items are 
passed through to you, the shareholder, on a Schedule K-1. Then you re -
port the Schedule K-1 tax items on your Form 1040, and pay the resulting 
federal income tax at your personal level.
In contrast, if you run your business as a C corporation, you potentially 
run into the double-taxation problem. Why? First, corporate income is 
taxed at the corporate level. Then, when the C corporation sends the cash 
to you as dividends, you pay taxes on the dividend income. 
You avoid the threat of double taxation with an S corporation, because 
the S corporation acts like a big funnel that catches all of the income and 
expenses and passes through the net income and other condensed items to 
your Schedule K-1.
Beware of Restrictions and Disadvantages
To qualify for S corporation status and the pass-through taxation benefit, 
your company must meet strict criteria. Specifically, it must:1
l be a domestic corporation or a limited liability company, electing S 
corporation status,
l have 100 or fewer shareholders,
l have no shareholders other than U.S. citizen individuals, resident alien 
individuals, estates, certain types of trusts, and certain types of tax-
exempt entities, and
l have only one class of stock. 
224NotesIf your corporation violates any of these criteria, the C corporation tax 
rules apply (which means that the threat of double taxation lurks in the 
background).2
Thankfully, a single-owner or husband-and-wife owned business generally 
does not have to worry about violating the rules on being a qualified S cor -
poration. But before you make the decision to operate as an S corporation, 
consider the disadvantages and advantages that follow . 
Disadvantage 1:  Even though an S corporation generally pays no corpo -
rate-level federal income taxes, you still must file a corporate return each 
year on Form 1120S. And you must issue yourself a Schedule K-1 each 
year. The Schedule K-1 includes all the pass-through tax information from 
your S corporation’s business activities (amount of taxable income, deduc -
tions, tax credits, and so forth). You must take this information into ac -
count when you prepare your personal Form 1040. Depending on where 
you live, your state may require you to file a state return for your S corpo -
ration too, and there could even be a corporate-level state tax bill. 
This whole S corporation drill can get very complicated. You should use 
a competent tax pro to keep things straight. In contrast, choosing to run 
your business as a single-member LLC keeps things much simpler and 
keeps your tax-filing obligations to a minimum.
Disadvantage 2:  With an S corporation, you’ll also face extra tax-related 
paperwork each time you take money (or any other asset) out of the cor -
poration. Here’s why. You must treat each withdrawal as
l salary or bonus paid to you in your capacity as a corporate employee,
l a dividend paid to you in your capacity as a corporate shareholder, or 
l proceeds from a loan made by the corporation to you. 
If you treat the withdrawal as salary or bonus money, you’ll have to deal 
with employment taxes, employment tax forms, and W-2s. If you treat the 
withdrawal as a loan, you’ll need a written loan document to keep the IRS 
off your back. No fun! 
In contrast, if you choose to run your shop as a single-member LLC, 
transactions between you and your business generally won’t result in extra 
tax-related paperwork.
Disadvantage 3:  An S corporation may not transfer appreciated assets 
(current value greater than tax basis) to you without triggering a taxable 
gain that passes through to your Form 1040 and triggers tax at your per -
sonal level.3 With a single-member LLC, you do not have this problem. 
You can ignore this disadvantage if your business will not own any signifi -
cant appreciating assets. 
 
 225NotesDisadvantage 4:  If you die, the tax bases of your S corporation’s appreci -
ated capital gain assets (real estate, patents, copyrights, customer lists, and 
the like) do not get a step up to their date-of-death fair market values. The 
single-member LLC gives you a step up in basis, and that means lower 
bills for your relatives when they sell those assets.4 
You do not have to consider this disadvantage in a service business that 
will own very few, if any, appreciating assets.
Disadvantage 5:  Unlike the single-member LLC, where you can hire your 
spouse to put in place a Section 105 medical reimbursement plan, you 
have no such option with the S corporation. The reimbursement aspect 
of the Section 105 plan is not available to a more-than-2-percent owner of 
an S corporation. Moreover, the hiring-your-spouse strategy does not get 
around these rules, as the tax rules attribute your shareholder ownership 
to your employee-spouse. In other words, if you own 100 percent, your 
spouse also owns 100 percent for purposes of not qualifying for fringe 
benefits.
Disadvantage 6:  Compared to the sole proprietorship and the single-
member LLC, you get far less benefit when your S corporation hires your 
under-age-18 children to work in the business. Why? On wages paid to 
the children, the S corporation pays FICA, Medicare, and unemployment 
taxes. The children pay FICA and Medicare. This combination creates 
taxes of more than 20 percent that eat mightily into the benefits of the 
hire-your-child strategy. 
Disadvantage 7:  Defined contribution retirement-plan benefits are based 
on a percentage of salary for the corporation. If the corporate salary is 
low, the defined contribution is low . 
Tax law allows sole proprietorships and single-member LLCs to base 
defined contributions on net business income, a higher number. Thus, sole 
proprietorships and single-member LLCs produce bigger retirement contri -
butions.
When it comes to choosing a form of business, you need to weigh the 
aggregate dollar effects of disadvantages with the dollar effects of advan -
tages. Do this right. Get your tax professional’s help. The money you pay 
for this service is truly money well spent. 
Now turn your attention to the advantages of the S corporation.
226NotesAdvantage 1: S Corp + Modest Salary = Lower Taxes
An S corporation makes you both a corporate employee and a corporate 
shareholder. The corporation will pay you a salary that reflects the work 
you do for the business. 
In 2017, the first $127,200 of salary is subject to a 15.3 percent federal 
employment tax rate. Of that, 12.4 percent is for Social Security tax 
and 2.90 percent is for Medicare tax. Half of these taxes are withheld 
from your salary checks. The S corporation, in its role as your employer, 
pays the other half directly to the government. You must, of course, pay 
income tax at your personal level on salary received from the corporation. 
On the corporation’s annual tax return (Form 1120S), the corporation de -
ducts your salary and the employer’s half of Social Security and Medicare 
taxes. These corporate-level write-offs reduce the taxable income passed 
through to you on the Schedule K-1 you receive from the corporation. 
Then all corporate-level taxable income left after deducting your salary 
and related employment taxes can be paid out to you as a cash distribution 
without any Social Security or Medicare taxes.5
The leftover profit distribution can save you major bucks! Here’s why. 
With a single-member LLC, you pay self-employment taxes (Social 
Security and Medicare) on essentially all of your business income. 
However, with the S corporation, the law charges these taxes only on the 
portion of business income paid to you as salary. The following example 
illustrates this tax-saving distinction. 
Example:  Let’s say that you have your “choice of entity” decision nar -
rowed down to the single-member LLC and the S corporation. For 2017, 
you expect to earn $100,000 after paying all expenses, but before you pay 
any Social Security or Medicare taxes. Let’s assume that you choose the 
S corporation option, and a $40,000 salary is reasonable for your work in 
the business. The cash advantage to the S corporation is shown below:
  With LLC  With S Cor p
Business income $100,000 $100,000 
Corporate salary N/A -40,000
Corporate-level SS & Medicare
 taxes on salary N/A -3,060
Unemployment taxes N/A -342
Net business profit $100,000 $56,598
Salary N/A 40,000
SS & Medicare taxes paid by owner -14,130 -3,060
Income tax benefits 1,766 851 
Cash to owner $87,636 $94,389
Cash advantage to S corporation  $6,753The cash advantage 
here is money in 
the pocket from 
tax savings. Nice!
 227NotesThe $6,753 advantage is due solely to the Social Security and Medicare tax 
savings.
The “income tax benefits” in the example above come from deducting 
l 50 percent of the self-employment tax for the single-member LLC, 
and 
l 100 percent of the corporate level Social Security, Medicare, and un -
employment taxes. 
Also, we did not consider the extra cost for the S corporation tax return. 
We assumed that lawyer fees were about the same for both the S corpora -
tion and the single-member LLC.
Remember: if this were you, you could expect to reap the $6,753 in after-
tax cash savings year after year.
Caveats on the Low Salary
Naturally, there are limits on this strategy of using an S corporation com -
bined with a relatively modest corporate salary to slash Social Security 
and Medicare taxes. 
If your business ever gets audited, you must show that your salary level is 
reasonable for the work you perform. If it’s clearly way too low, the IRS 
could hit your S corporation with bills for back taxes, interest, and penal -
ties.6 That said, all instances of taxpayers who lost their court cases on this 
issue involved absurdly low salary levels.7
The moral: do not tempt fate by setting your salary so low that it’s clearly 
ridiculous.
Big Advantage 2: Income Splitting
Another major reason some proprietors prefer the S corporation is the 
income-splitting benefits. If you are in the 35 percent tax bracket and your 
78-year-old father is in the 10 percent tax bracket, why not make some 
of that corporate income available to your father and save 25 percent in 
taxes? Exactly!
To achieve the savings, you make your father a partial owner of the cor -
poration. You can do this by making gifts of stock. Let’s say your father 
owns 1/3 of the stock and that, after deducting your corporate salary, 
the S corporation’s profits are $63,000. Your father receives $21,000 (1/3 
of $63,000) in cash profits from your corporation, pays tax of $2,100, 
228Notesand uses the remaining $18,900 for living expenses. As a family, you save 
$5,250 in taxes with this strategy.
Income splitting has a downside: The father now owns the stock! How do 
you get it back? Obviously, you need to think about this. It’s highly prob -
ably that the stock will find its way back to you as an inheritance. 
Beware with children:  Effective 2008 and later, new kiddie tax rules apply 
the parents’ tax rate to college children under the age of 24. Thus, income 
splitting with these children is no longer productive. 
Summary 
There are three reasons to choose the S corporation as your 
liability-limiting entity.
Reason 1:  You want to save Social Security and Medicare taxes. In ex -
change for this advantage you are willing to live with the extra tax-related 
paperwork that S corporation status entails compared to sole proprietor -
ship or single-member LLC status.
Reason 2:  You want the income-splitting benefits of the S corporation and 
are willing to live with the extra paperwork. 
Reason 3:  You want pass-through taxation, and the single-member LLC 
option is not available to a one-owner business in your state.

 229Notes Section 37
The One-Owner and Husband-
and-Wife-Owned C Corporation
In the last section, you learned how the S corporation could protect you 
from legal liability and put money in your pocket by
reducing your self-employment taxes, and l
 splitting income with family members.  l
You also learned that you get that legal protection with a single-member 
LLC and also keep your tax life simple. Further, you learned that, in the 
right circumstances, the single-member LLC is the best tax-reduction 
choice compared with the S corporation or the C corporation. 
Here you will be happy to learn that, like the single-member LLC and 
the solely owned S corporation, the solely owned C corporation generally 
protects your personal assets from exposure to business-related liabilities. 
Good! (Under applicable state law, you get exactly the same degree of 
liability protection from either an S or C corporation; the only difference 
between the two is how they are taxed.)
Historical Disadvantage of Double Taxation
The historical disadvantage of C corporation status is the threat of double 
taxation. Basically, double taxation means business income and gains 
get taxed once at the corporate level and again when you receive cash or 
assets from the company in the form of dividends or liquidating distribu -
tions. This double-taxation problem arises because your C corporation 
cannot deduct these dividends or distributions even though you pay taxes 
on them at your personal level. 
Before the 2003 Economic Stimulus Tax Act, double taxation was an 
absolutely horrible outcome. Why? Because dividends were taxed at up 
to 38.6 percent. Now it’s not nearly so bad. Under current law, you face a 
maximum tax on dividends of 23.8 percent (20 percent for the dividends 
and 3.8 percent for Medicare).1 Even so, you still want to avoid double 
taxation whenever you can.
Bad Place for Business Losses
If your business is in the start-up phase or suffering a business downturn, 
the C corporation puts you at a disadvantage when it generates tax losses. 
230NotesWhen the loss occurs inside your C corporation, the C corporation cannot 
pass those losses to you. In contrast, with a single-member LLC or an S 
corporation, the tax losses do pass through to you, and generally you can 
deduct them immediately on your Form 1040.
So does the C corporation option ever make sense? Yes. It can be a tax-
smart choice when you
l don’t anticipate tax losses, and
l can avoid double taxation. 
In fact, the C corporation can be a great choice in exactly the right circum -
stances, as you will soon see. 
Zero Out Corporate Income to Avoid Double 
Taxation
Your solely owned C corporation may be able to avoid double taxation 
simply by zeroing out  its taxable income every year with deductible pay -
ments that benefit you. Such payments can take the form of 
salary and bonuses paid to you for your work in the business,  l
 rent paid to you for business assets that you lease to the company (copy -  l
rights, patents, land and building at the business location, and so forth), 
 interest paid to you for money you loan the company, l
 payments to a health plan that covers your family health insurance premi -  l
ums and your uninsured medical costs, and
 company contributions to your personal tax-deferred retirement plan.  l
If you can zero out the corporation’s taxable income every year with these 
types of payments (all of which benefit you personally), your company 
won’t owe any income tax. So there won’t be any double taxation. Of 
course, you’ll owe income tax at the personal level on the salary and bonus 
payments. All in all, this is a very good deal! 
Still, you’ll always have the threat of double taxation hanging over your 
head. If your company gets audited and the IRS decides your purported 
salary and bonuses were actually disguised dividends, all the apparent 
advantages of operating as a C corporation can vanish overnight. Not a 
good deal!
Our take:  Relying on the strategy of zeroing out your C corporation’s tax -
able income in order to avoid double taxation is a time-honored practice. 
It’s also risky! In most cases, it’s probably not worth the risk of reclassifica -
tion in the case of an audit, even though your risk of audit is mighty low . 
When you intend to siphon as much cash as possible out of your business 
for the benefit of you and yours, we advise against the C corporation and 
recommend the single-member LLC and S corporation alternatives.
 231NotesLeave Everything Inside the Corporation to Avoid 
Double Taxation
Say you are a high-bracket taxpayer. You have a growth business that 
generates a healthy, but not huge, amount of annual taxable income. To 
the extent possible, you want to finance your business’s growing capital 
requirements with internally generated cash. You expect to withdraw little 
or no cash for yourself. Down the road, you plan on selling the business 
for a big profit. 
If you run this operation as a C corporation, you can
l pay income taxes at favorable corporate rates, 
l completely avoid double taxation, and 
l avoid the dreaded Social Security and Medicare taxes by taking zero 
cash out of the company. 
At the personal level, you’ll owe zero income taxes until you bail out by 
selling your corporate stock to the new owner. When you sell the corpo -
rate stock (assuming you’ve owned the stock for more than a year when 
you sell), you pay capital gains taxes at the following rates:2 
Capital Gains Tax 
RateAdjusted Taxable 
Income SingleAdjusted Taxable 
Income MarriedAdjusted Taxable 
Income Head of   
Household
0 percent Up to $37,950 Up to $75,900 Up to $50,800
15 percent$37,950 to 
$418,400$75,900 to 
$470,700$50,800 to 
$444,550
20 percent Over $418,400 Over $470,700 Over $444,550
In addition, you pay the 3.8 percent Medicare tax when investment in -
come such as capital gains exceeds $250,000 if married, or $200,000 if 
unmarried.3
This can be a good plan; in fact, this plan may be even better than it looks 
at first blush. The following example illustrates how a C corporation can 
save major taxes in this scenario.
Example: Save Taxes with Corporate Rates 
Under our federal tax system, a C corporation’s annual income is taxed ac -
cording to the following graduated rate schedule:
l 15 percent on the first $50,000;
l 25 percent on $50,001 to $75,000; 
l 34 percent on $75,001 to $100,000;
l 39 percent on $100,001 to $335,000; 
l 34 percent on $335,001 to $10 million. 
232NotesAs you can see, the first $50,000 of annual income is taxed at only 15 per -
cent. The first $75,000 is taxed at an average rate of only 18.33 percent. In 
fact, the first $100,000 is taxed at an average rate of only 22.25 percent. 
Those are some pretty low rates—especially when your personal marginal 
rate is 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, or 35 percent because you have 
income from other sources. 
If you choose for this new business either the single-member LLC or the 
S corporation, the taxable income it generates passes through to you and 
gets taxed at your current personal rate. Further, with a single-member 
LLC, you pay Social Security and Medicare taxes even when you do not 
take any cash out of the business. 
To make this crystal clear, let’s look at some easy numbers. Let’s assume 
the business we are talking about will generate $75,000 of annual taxable 
income. You do not need the cash. You simply leave the cash in the busi -
ness. Depending on your choice of business entity, your federal tax bill 
stacks up as follows:4 
 Personal Rate  C Corp  S Corp  SMLLC 
 25% $13,750  $18,750  $20,508
 28% 13,750 21,000 22,727
 33% 13,750 24,750 26,427
 35% 13,750 26,250 27,907  
Wow! By running this new business as a C corporation, you reap annual 
tax savings of up to $14,157. Using the 35 percent rate, compare your 
taxes at the C corporation level ($13,750) with the taxes at the single-
member LLC level ($27,907). 
Again, the annual savings accrue because you let the net income ride in -
side the C corporation. If it does not ride, your result is much different, be -
cause you then pay the 15 percent tax on dividends from your corporation. 
In this example, that increases the net tax on the C corporation profits to 
$22,937 when you add both the tax the corporation pays and the tax you 
personally pay on the dividends.
So failure to let the profits ride kills the C corporation strategy.
When you sell your stock in this corporation, you will pay capital gains 
taxes, say at 15 percent. If you do this early in the game, you also kill the 
C corporation strategy. But if you can wait for 10, 20, or 30 years, you win 
with the time value of money, which can be huge. In 2017, your individual tax 
on dividends ranges from 
a low of zero to a high of 
23.8 percnet depending on 
your income and whether or 
not you pay the 3.8 percent 
Medicare tax..
 233NotesSummary 
The C corporation is seldom the tax-smart choice, but in certain circum -
stances, it can produce savings. For example, a single taxpayer who needs 
a medical reimbursement plan might use the C corporation to good advan -
tage. Additionally, if you have all four of the following attributes, you save 
money with the C corporation. 
You expect the business to generate annual taxable income of 1. 
$100,000 or less, and your personal marginal tax rate is 25 percent 
or higher (meaning you would benefit from the lower corporate tax 
rates).
You don’t expect the business to generate tax losses (with a C corpora - 2. 
tion, you would get no annual flow-through benefit from the losses, 
and that’s a bad thing).
You will let the cash profits ride and will not withdraw any significant 3. 
cash or assets from the business (with a C corporation, such 
withdrawals generally result in double taxation, a no-no for your cash 
flow).
You will keep the business for a minimum of 10 years and then will 4. 
effect a tax-deferred transaction or sell at your favorable capital gains 
rate.
It takes special circumstances to make the C corporation the liability-limit -
ing entity of choice. If you do not have those special circumstances, then a 
single-member LLC or an S corporation is the best choice for you.

 235Notes Section 38
Tactics for Paying the Owner 
of an S Corporation the Lowest 
Possible Salary
Seven years ago the IRS hired 5,000 new auditors to look at S corpora -
tion salaries and employment tax issues. Why this huge increase? The IRS 
spotted an alarming trend: Some taxpayers are forming S corporations and 
cheating on the salary part.
Make sure you get your salary right. If the S corporation gets the salary 
business wrong, it faces penalties that can exceed 100 percent of the taxes 
due.1 In other words, the IRS computes the amount that should have been 
paid in taxes and then slaps that amount with individual penalties ranging 
from 2 percent to 100 percent each.
To achieve the S corporation benefits, small business owners try to keep 
the salaries low so they can realize:
l Social Security and FICA tax savings over what they would normally 
pay as a proprietorship
l Profits they can split with others in lower tax brackets
For example, say that the bottom line of your Schedule C shows a profit 
that will make you pay self-employment tax on $90,000 of income for a 
total self-employment tax of $13,770. If you could form an S corporation 
and justify a salary of $30,000, you would pay only $4,590 in Social Secu -
rity taxes. 
The $30,000 salary saves you $9,180 in after-tax cash. That’s huge!
You can see that you have a powerful motive to keep the salary low . On 
the other hand, if that salary is too low, you could face the more-than-100 
percent penalty problem and your tax reduction strategy could turn into a 
tax-and-penalty-paying-strategy. 
The other reason to keep the salary low is to split profits with relatives in 
lower tax brackets. If you take a $40,000 salary and earn $100,000, you 
can split $60,000 with the relatives. But with earnings of $100,000 and a 
salary of $70,000, you have only $30,000 to split. 
If you are in the 40 percent tax bracket and the college freshman you want 
to split income with is in the 10 percent bracket, your family unit keeps 
236Notes30 cents on the dollar for each dollar in profits you split. If you split 1/3 
with the freshman, your family saves only $3,000 in after-tax cash with a 
$70,000 salary, but with $40,000 produces a family savings of $6,000.
Not all S corporations are formed for the purpose of saving Social Securi -
ty taxes and/or splitting income. However, most proprietorships and 1099 
taxpayers that form the S corporation, for other than liability protection, 
are looking for tax savings.
So how low can you go with the salary? Can the salary be zero? No! 
If you own the S corporation and you provide services to the corporation, 
your salary may not be zero.2 Tax law says that you are an employee of 
your corporation for Social Security tax purposes, unless exempted from 
this rule.3 You are not going to be exempt. As an officer of the corpora -
tion, you are exempt only if:
l You do no work for the corporation, and
l You neither receive, nor are entitled to receive, directly or indirectly, 
any remuneration.4 
In Spicer Accounting, Inc., the sole shareholder and only worker of this S 
corporation paid himself dividends, but no salary. The court ruled that all 
the so-called dividends were salary.5 
In Revenue Ruling 74-44, two shareholders of an S corporation took zero 
salaries and claimed all profits as dividends not subject to employment 
taxes. Wrong, ruled the IRS as it classified the dividends as wages for 
FICA, FUTA, and federal income tax withholding.
The IRS is not the only government agency that gets upset by zero sal -
ary. The Social Security Administration has an interest in this issue. In 
Ludeking v Finch, the taxpayer incorporated his sole proprietorship as an 
S corporation. He took zero salary, but received corporate distributions. 
The court ruled that the Social Security Administration had the authority 
to change improper dividends to wages for services performed.6
The bottom line:  Zero salary is out! The IRS wins its cases against zero 
salary. The Social Security Administration wins its cases against zero sal -
ary. The taxpayer pays taxes and penalties.
The IRS won in Radtke. Here, the S corporation paid zero salary. The 
court ruled that the S corporation had to treat its sole full-time worker 
as an employee and classify the dividends as wages.7 In Weiss, the court 
noted that case law makes it clear that the S corporation may not choose 
to classify wages as dividends.8
 237NotesThe zero salary approach simply does not work. Then what is the proper 
division between dividends and salary? Is there a formula? Does the IRS 
provide guidance? No, this is an area where the practice of taxes becomes 
an art form, not a scientific endeavor.
Thus, rule one: Pay a salary! 
The courts have decided many cases on the “no-salary” issue. However, 
the courts have faced far fewer cases when the IRS attacked as unreason -
able the salary paid the S corporation officer. 
In Rocco,9 the IRS lost its bid to allocate S corporation dividends to Roc -
co’s salary. Rocco created an S corporation with a total capital structure of 
$2,500, kept 4 percent for himself, and sold 96 percent to family members. 
Obviously, Rocco was looking at some income-splitting benefits.
After Rocco’s salary payment, the company distributed big dollars to the 
shareholders. The IRS thought the small capital structure, small salary, 
and large dividend too much and took Rocco to court. The Court ruled 
that Rocco’s salary was more than adequate. Rocco and his accountant 
proved to the court that an outside person could do his job for one-third of 
what he took in salary.
Planning tip:  Rocco not only took a salary, but he also proved that the sal -
ary he took was reasonable. Think like this when you plan your salary.
The IRS also lost the Davis case.10 Davis, an orthopedic surgeon, orga -
nized two S corporations: (1) the X-ray company and (2) the physical 
therapy company. He gave 90 percent of the stock in the two corporations 
to his three minor children. The IRS tried to allocate all income of the two 
corporations to Davis as salary. The court said no, absolutely not! Davis 
spent little time on the two corporations, although most of the patients 
came from Davis’ referrals.
The IRS won a partial victory in the Roob case.11 Roob offered no evi -
dence to support his low salary. He operated his photo studio as a sole pro -
prietorship. When he incorporated and chose S status, he split ownership 
equally among himself, his wife, and his eight children. 
The IRS got the court to raise Roob’s salary and cut the dividends to the 
shareholders. However, even with the loss to the IRS, Roob came out 
ahead. 
As an S corporation, he made the same money he would have made as a 
sole proprietor. The court ruled that 55 percent of the income should be 
wages and 45 percent should be dividends. Thus, Roob had 45 percent of 
the income:
238Notesl Not subject to employment taxes
l Split in 10 parts for himself, his wife, and his eight children
Roob could have done better. He presented no evidence to refute the IRS 
allocation of income to his salary. He should have had evidence of a 
proper salary based on such factors as:12
l Time spent working
l Business size and complexity
l Responsibilities 
l Nature of work
l Wages and salaries paid by similar firms
Had Roob taken a little time to create some tax evidence, he could have 
saved himself considerable time and grief. Also, think of the attorney fees 
and anxiety he suffered to solve this matter. 
If you are looking to save money on Social Security taxes and/or split in -
come with family members, you want to pay a low salary. Make sure you 
do your homework up front. 
If you are the owner and sole employee of the S corporation, your best 
evidence is wages paid by comparable firms. Then you can justify the divi -
dends based on business goodwill, know-how, location, physical plant, and 
equipment.

 239Notes
Section 39
Corporation Must Earn the 
Income; Assignment of Income 
Fails
The Checks Must Come to the Corporation in the 
Corporate Name. No Exceptions.
In an effort to save self-employment taxes, some people form corporations 
and then “assign their incomes” to the corporations. This “assignment 
method” does not work!
The law says that “gross income” includes all income from whatever 
source derived, including compensation for services, fees, and commis -
sions.1 Fundamental to this principle is that the government taxes income 
to the person who earns it.2 The person or entity who earns the income is 
the person or entity who controls the earning of the income.3
Truxal assigned his income to a family trust (a separate legal entity). The 
court ruled that the income belonged to Truxal as an individual because 
the customers did not deal with the family trust and probably did not 
know anything about the trust.4
Brooks assigned his insurance commissions to his corporation. The court 
ruled that the insurance commissions belonged to Brooks and should be 
taxed to Brooks.5 The insurance contract was between Brooks and the 
insurance company. The insurance company made the checks in Brooks’ 
name, not the name of the corporation. 
Evatt assigned his real estate sales commissions to his corporation. The 
court ruled that the real estate commissions belonged to Evatt and should 
be taxed to Evatt.6 The court noted that the real estate sales contracts were 
between Evatt the individual and the customers. The corporation was not 
a party to the contracts. 
240NotesMany people form S corporations in an effort to save Social Security taxes. 
An S corporation does not pay tax. Instead, S corporation profits flow to 
the stockholders and get taxed to the stockholders as individuals.7 To save 
Social Security taxes, the S corporation compensates the person in two 
ways:
l Salary—earned income subject to self-employment taxes
l Distributions of profits (think of them as dividends), which are not 
subject to Social Security
In the right circumstances, an S corporation is a wonderful form of busi -
ness, but you must be careful when commissions are involved. The two 
cases that follow illustrate what happens when you do it right and what 
happens when you do it wrong. Jackson does it right by receiving com -
missions in the corporate name. Isom does it wrong by receiving commis -
sions in his personal name. Jackson and Isom get two completely different 
results.
Example:  Jackson forms Jackson, Inc., an S corporation. Before 
incorporating, Jackson had Schedule C income of $60,000 and he paid 
self-employment taxes of $9,180. After incorporation, his corporate/
employer and individual/employee FICA and Medicare (the equal 
of self-employment tax) totals only $6,120 on his $40,000 salary. He 
pays zero employment taxes on his $20,000 dividend. Thus, with the S 
corporation strategy, Jackson saves more than $3,000 a year in after-tax 
cash. 
Fly in the ointment:  The S corporation strategy to save Social Security 
works when the law recognizes the S corporation as the legal entity that 
earns the money. Many companies will not make commission checks pay -
able to a corporation. In such cases, some salespeople hope to get around 
the problem by simply assigning the income to their corporations. This 
“assignment” can fail. 
Example:  Bruce Isom8 worked as an independent agent for American 
Family Insurance Co. For several years after Isom incorporated and chose 
S corporation status, American Family cut commission checks in favor of 
Isom’s S corporation. Then, after a legal review in 1987, American Family 
stopped cutting checks in favor of Isom’s S corporation. 
The stoppage upset Isom. He did not want to abandon his S corporation. 
To keep things going as before, he simply took the checks made out in his 
name and endorsed them to his S corporation. That worked until the IRS 
audited Isom’s S corporation and declared it a “sham.” The court agreed 
 241Noteswith the IRS and allocated more than $100,000 of the S corporation’s 
income to Isom so that he could personally pay self-employment taxes on 
this income.
Technical notes:  The court noted that Isom’s corporation failed the tests 
for corporate recognition because:
l Isom’s corporation did not have the right to direct Isom’s activities in 
some meaningful way, and
l Isom’s S corporation did not have a contract to sell insurance with 
American Family Insurance.
Doing it right: For the corporation to stand up to scrutiny, you want the 
corporation recognized as the:9 
l Entity authorized to make sales 
l Employer of the agent (you) who makes the sales 
Also, you want the checks to arrive in the corporate name.10
Summary:  To get the benefits of incorporation, you need first to establish 
that the corporation is a bona fide legal entity. The corporation should: 
l Execute contracts
l Receive commissions in its name
l Direct your activities (remember you are the employee—have your 
“corporate-self ” talk to your “employee-self ” in writing)

Section 40
Loans to Your Corporation Could 
Be Hazardous to Your Financial 
Health
Once you incorporate your business, you no longer engage in that busi -
ness. The business now belongs to the corporation.1 The corporation 
engages in the business. You are simply the owner of the corporation.
You might work for your corporation. When you work for your corpora -
tion, you are an employee of the corporation.
Let’s say you own 100 percent of the corporation. This corporation has 
operated quite well for a number of years but now is having a little finan -
cial difficulty. You need to give the corporation a cash infusion. 
You make a loan of your personal funds to the corporation. It continues to 
underperform. You give it another loan, and another. Soon, you have no 
choice but to take the corporation into bankruptcy.
The trustee liquidates the corporation and gets pennies on the dollar. 
There’s no cash for you; the lawyers get the pennies. You want to write off 
the bad loans on your taxes. You are out the cash. How is the write-off go -
ing to work? In a word, badly.
You made the loans to the corporation in your capacity as an employee 
of the corporation. At the time you made the loan, the tax law considered 
you in the business of being an employee.2 Thus, your deductions for the 
bad loans are going to be bad-debt miscellaneous itemized deductions, 
subject to the 2 percent of adjusted gross income floor. The 2 percent of 
adjusted gross income subtraction from your miscellaneous deductions is 
not great, but this could be minor compared with the real problem.
The real problem is that for alternative minimum tax (AMT) purposes, 
you get zero deduction for the bad loans. 
As we have stated many times before, the AMT is a truly unfair tax: It 
taxes the deductions lawmakers grant you on your regular tax return.
In this case, your bad loans are bad-debt deductions that tax law allows in 
the miscellaneous itemized deduction section of your Schedule A, Form 
 243Notes
  1.  Graves v Commr., 99 AFTR 2d 2007-950, 2/8/2007.
  2.  Ibid.1040—the part subject to the 2 percent of adjusted gross income floor. But 
when you compute the AMT, you get no deduction whatsoever for any 
miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2 percent of adjusted 
gross income floor.
Example.  On your regular taxes, you claimed a $100,000 bad-debt deduc -
tion based on the money you lost when you made the loan to your cor -
poration. For AMT purposes, you get a zero deduction for the $100,000. 
Further, the AMT does not allow you to carry over the lost $100,000 
deduction. The AMT makes the $100,000 deduction disappear forever. 
Yikes!
Planning tip.  If your business needs a loan, ask yourself and answer truth -
fully: Is the business going to make it? If not, don’t make the loan. That’s 
hard, no question. But face it; if the business isn’t going to make it, the 
loan only delays the inevitable.
If the business is going to make it, then make the loan, put the terms in 
writing, and live by the repayment terms. Don’t fool around with this. 
Remember, you get the short end of the stick when you are an employee 
of your corporation and the loan you make to your corporation goes sour. 
This loan problem is one of the disadvantages of incorporation that you 
need to consider when choosing your operating entity. 
Planning tip.  If you think the business is going to fail but, against your 
better judgment, you still want to make the loan, consider an additional 
investment in the corporation, called an additional contribution to capital . If 
you do this and the business fails, you generate a capital loss. Although the 
limit on net capital losses (after offsets with gains) is $3,000 a year, that’s 
certainly preferable to no deduction at all.

Section 41
What Your Corporation Can 
Reimburse to You and Its Other 
Employees and Why That’s Very 
Important
Who owns the business car, you or your corporation? If it’s you, you can 
often pocket considerably more after-tax cash when you know the reim -
bursement rules. 
The IRS says that the corporation (an employer) may reimburse an em -
ployee for business expenses which include, among others,1
trade or business expenses, l
interest expenses, l
taxes, l
losses, l
bad debts, l
depreciation,  l
cost recovery, l
research and development,  l
amortization of lease acquisition costs, l
Section 179 expensing, l
deductions for clean fuel vehicles, l
amortization of costs for removing barriers to handicapped workers, l
start-up expenditures, and l
goodwill. l
The employee must incur these expenses in the performance of duties for 
the corporation or other employer.2 Further, the employee must substanti -
ate the expenses to the corporation in accordance with any specific condi -
tions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.3
For example, if the corporation or other employer reimburses travel, enter -
tainment, automobile, computer, or airplane expenses, the employee must 
submit the documents that support these deductions in accordance with 
the rules for these deductions. Thus, for travel, the employee must submit 
receipts for expenses of $75 or more, and justify the business reason for 
the trip, etc. For automobile, the employee must prove the business use of 
the vehicle, like keeping a three-month log of use, and have receipts for 
expenses of $75 or more.
 245Notes
If the employee is reimbursed for the home-office deduction, the employer 
must demand proof that substantiates administrative use, regular use, and 
exclusive use. In other words, the employer acts like an auditor for the IRS 
making sure that the expenses meet the requirements of the law .
If the employee fails to submit adequate proof, the employer must include 
the expense reimbursements in the W-2 of the employee.4 Yikes! No one 
wants that.
Avoid the W-2. Submit proper proof. With proper proof, the corporation 
or other employer gets the tax deduction and the employee who gets the 
reimbursement has no taxable income.5
This is the result you want. You do not want to claim the expenses person -
ally as employee business expenses on your IRS Form 1040. If you do 
claim employee business expenses, two bad things attack your deductions,
the 2 percent of adjusted gross income floor, and l
the alternative minimum tax. l
The IRS regulation includes depreciation and cost recovery as reimburs -
able expenses.6 A while back, Ralph M. Parsons Company reimbursed 
Milton Lewis $14,007 to cover 60 percent of the depreciation and main -
tenance expenses on the home that he used for business entertainment.7 
(The law authorizing the deduction for depreciation of a home used for 
home entertainment has been eliminated for some time now, but this case 
illustrates the depreciation reimbursement). IRS Private Letter Ruling 
6406174570A states that a college can reimburse a professor for his home-
office expenses, including depreciation.
Failure to Ask S Corp. for Reimbursements Costs 
Travel Deductions
Tibor Horwath and his wife owned 100 percent of their S corporation. 
Tibor also operated his consulting business as a sole proprietorship and 
periodically consulted with the S corporation.
The S corporation got a contract from Primex. The S corporation con -
tracted with Tibor for some consulting on its Primex contract. Tibor 
incurred $16,812 of legitimate travel expenses while performing the con -
tract, but he made a fatal error: he did not submit the travel to his S corpo -
ration for reimbursement. Instead, he deducted the travel on his Schedule 
C sole proprietorship return.
246Notes
The court ruled that Tibor gets no deductions for this travel.8 His contract 
said to submit the travel to his S corporation. Tibor’s failure to submit the 
travel for reimbursement destroyed his proprietorship deduction. But this 
gets worse.
The S corporation also gets no deduction because it did not claim the 
expenses on its original tax return and now more than three years have 
passed, making it too late for the S corporation to amend its tax return.
Planning note:  When you operate all or some of your business as a corpo -
ration, you must pay attention to the separate legal status of the corpora -
tion. You also have to honor the agreements you make with your corpora -
tion, even when you own 100 percent of the stock.
AMT Destroys Employee  Business Expenses
Elmer Hopson suffered a shock to his tax return. He claimed $38,062 in 
employee business expenses as itemized deductions against his wage and 
salary income of $69,432. After other deductions, he calculated his regular 
income tax at $1,526.
But, as the IRS pointed out, Elmer made a tragic mistake. He failed to 
calculate the “alternative minimum tax” (AMT). In the AMT calculation, 
his $38,062 of employee business expenses disappear and turn to a zero 
deduction. 
The AMT changed his taxes from $1,526 to $5,341. Shocked, Elmer 
amended his tax return and took the IRS to court, where he promptly lost 
and paid the AMT as required by the law .9
Planning note:  Regular business expenses reduce your taxes, both regular 
taxes and AMT taxes. Employee business expenses do not reduce your 
AMT taxes. Avoid this problem. Have your corporation reimburse your 
expenses or have the corporation pay the expenses directly.

Tax Tips to Save Your Social 
Security Benefits
Are you collecting or about to collect Social Security benefits before you 
reach full retirement age of 66?
Are you going to have business income while collecting Social Security?
If you said “yes” to both questions, you could pay taxes equal to 97.99 
percent on your Social Security benefits. We suspect this would not make 
you happy.
Whoo, Explain that 97.99 Percent Tax
Jan Smith, age 62, is married to Fred Smith. They are in the 25 percent 
income tax bracket and file a joint tax return.
Ms. Smith is self-employed, earning $26,920 in net self-employment 
income for the year. The $26,920 is $10,000 more than the $16,920 maxi -
mum early retirement earnings allowed by Social Security. Watch how Mr. 
and Mrs. Smith part with 96.14 percent of this $10,000 in excess earnings:
Because Ms. Smith earns $10,000 more than the $16,920 lawmakers 1. 
allow in earned income for early Social Security retirement benefits, 
she must return 50 cents on each excess dollar.1 She has $10,000 in 
excess dollars so she can say goodbye to the $5,000 she has to return.2
Ms. Smith also pays $1,413 in self-employment taxes on the $10,000 2. 
excess earnings.3
The $10,000 in excess earnings triggers $2,323 in net income taxes on 3. 
this $10,000 of self-employment income.4
Finally, the stealth income arrives. Because Mr. and Mrs. Smith earn 4. 
more than $44,000, Ms. Smith must include 85 percent of her Social 
Security benefits in taxable income. The net amount left from the 
original $10,000 in excess earnings is $5,000. The tax on 85 percent of 
this $5,000 is $1,063.5 
250NotesTotal tax.  $9,799! Wow, that seems awfully unfair. On this $10,000 of ad -
ditional income, Ms. Smith keeps $201.
What Do You Think?
When you pay into Social Security, you probably think you are
earning your Social Security benefit, l
entitled to your Social Security benefit, and l
going to receive your Social Security benefit. l
That’s what Ms. Smith thought. 
She needs to do some tax planning.
Taxes to Consider
If you under full retirement age drawing Social Security benefits and 1. 
you earn more than $16,920, your Social Security benefits are cut 50 
cents on the dollar for each dollar of earnings in excess of $16,920.6
If you are drawing Social Security benefits and earn more than 2. 
$44,880 in the months before the month in which you reach the 
month of your 2017 full retirement age of 66, your Social Security 
benefits are cut by $1 for every $3 of earnings in excess of $44,880.7
Regardless of retirement age, your Social Security benefits are subject 3. 
to the income tax.
Income Tax on Social Security Benefits
To determine whether Social Security benefits are subject to income taxes, 
you first have to find your inclusion category, which tells you how much 
of your Social Security is subject to the income tax. There are three pos -
sible inclusion categories:
Zero. l
50 percent of your Social Security benefits over the threshold. l
85 percent of your Social Security benefits over the threshold. l
 251NotesFirst Step
The first step in finding your inclusion category is to find your threshold 
amount by adding together all of the following:8
Adjusted gross income from your Form 1040 l
50 percent of your Social Security benefits l
Tax exempt interest l
Student loan interest deduction l
Tuition and fees deduction l9
Domestic production activities deduction l10
Exclusion of interest from Series EE and I U.S. Savings Bonds issued  l
after 198911
Exclusion of foreign earned income or housing l12
Exclusion of income for bona fide residents of American Samoa l13
Exclusion of income for bona fide residents of Puerto Rico l14
Exclusion for employed-provided adoption expenses l15
Above
If your threshold total from the above exceeds16
$44,000 for married taxpayers, or l
$34,000 for single taxpayers, l
you include and pay tax on 85 percent of the Social Security benefits that 
exceed the threshold amount. 
Below
If your inclusion total falls in the range from17
$32,000 to $44,000 for married taxpayers, or l
$25,000 to $34,000 for single taxpayers, l
you include and pay tax on 50 percent of the benefits to the extent such 
benefits fall in the range.
252NotesUse a C Corporation to Avoid the Taxes
If you do not operate a tax-defined personal service business, you could 
incorporate your business and operate as a C corporation to
shelter income inside the corporation until you reach full retirement  l
age;
hoard up to $250,000 in corporate income with no plan for this  l
money;18
adopt a retirement plan to reduce and defer income until after full  l
retirement age;19
keep your earned income (salary) at a level that does not trigger taxes  l
on your Social Security and/or does not trigger recapture of benefits;20
defer income by using a fiscal year that ends in January; l21
grant you fringe benefits, like group term life insurance and a 100 per -  l
cent medical reimbursement plan.
Caution for Personal Service Corporations 
The strategies above work for corporations that are not classed as personal 
service corporations. In general, your corporation is a personal service 
corporation if you are the one who does the work and you do that work in 
one of the following fields:22
Health l
Law  l
Engineering (including surveying and mapping) l
Architecture l
Accounting l
Actuarial science  l
Performing arts l
Consulting l
Sales are not consulting.23 If your remuneration depends on the con -
summation of a transaction—as in insurance, financial planning, or real 
estate—you are not a consultant. You are in sales, and you may form a 
corporation without it being classed in the unfavorable “personal service” 
group.
If you are in the personal service corporation group, consider the S corpo -
ration strategy. 
 253NotesUse an S Corporation to Avoid Taxes
The S corporation is a regular corporation, but the shareholders (for ex -
ample, you) elect to be taxed as individuals.24 
Think of the S corporation as a funnel with two spouts. In the top of the 
funnel, you put all your income and expenses—just as you would with a 
sole proprietorship. However, out of the two spouts you receive
salary (earned income), and1. 
distributions (like dividends, which are not earned income).2. 25 
Further, on the distributions that your S corporation makes to you, you do 
not pay FICA or Medicare taxes. Thus, the S corporation can help you
avoid the loss of Social Security benefits before you reach full retire -  l
ment age, and
avoid paying Social Security taxes into the system.  l
Example.  Let’s say that Ms. Smith from the example above forms an S 
corporation and now earns a $15,480 salary and receives a $10,000 dis -
tribution. Assuming that the salary is reasonable, Ms. Smith’s corporate 
form 
saves $1,413 in FICA and Medicare taxes;  l
saves $5,000 in Social Security benefits; and l
spends an extra $1,063 on the additional $5,000 in Social Security  l
income of which 85 percent is subject to income taxes. (The extra 
$5,000 comes from the fact that Ms. Smith does not have excess 
earned income over the $15,480 and thus does not have to return half 
of the $10,000 to the government like she did earlier.) 
Her net savings with the S corporation form of business are $5,350 or 54.6 
percent of what she lost in the earlier example.
Final Thoughts and Pointer
Somehow, it just doesn’t feel right when you have to plan to save your 
Social Security benefits. After all, you’d think that your Social Security is 
yours.
If you are planning on receiving your Social Security benefits before full 
retirement age, this is a good time to start thinking about your plan. 
254NotesRegardless of your current form of business, you need to examine what you 
plan to do with Social Security. There are several parts to this equation as you 
learned in this section. We recommend spending a few moments with your tax 
advisor to get the best strategy in place. 
This section gives both you and your advisor some of the basics to consider, 
but the planning part is a put-pencil-to-paper exercise to produce the best 
results.
If you are already receiving early retirement Social Security and taking a 
licking, it’s not too late to get your plan in place and start saving your money.
 255Notes

  2.  Technically, this is not a tax—just a return of benefits. But since she loses the 
money to the government, we are calling this a tax. Also, she does not write a 
check to return the excess benefits, she simply suffers a reduction in future ben -
efits. But the bottom line is that she is suffering a $5,000 loss in income.
  3.  2017 self-employment tax rate of 15.3 percent times .9235 times $10,000 equals 
$1,413.
  4.  25 percent times ($10,000 minus $707—the 50 percent of the employer’s portion 
of the self-employment tax) equals $2,323.
  5.  25 percent times $5,000 times 85 percent equals $1,063.
  6.  The 2017 full retirement age is age 66. Self-employment earnings and wages in 
excess of the $16,920 limit reduce Social Security retirement benefits.

 257Notes Section 43
Avoiding and Coping with the 
Dreaded IRS
Who audits the returns:  Ignoring the computer inquiry or correspon -
dence audit, your initial return examination will be conducted by a:
l Tax auditor, or
l Revenue agent.
Tax auditor:  If you go down to the IRS to present your side of the story, 
you generally visit with a tax auditor. Don’t expect a tax expert. The IRS 
requires a tax auditor to have a four-year college degree (in any field, for 
example, history). Tax auditors advance above the mid-salary range by 
completing six semester hours of accounting (such as the basic introduc -
tion courses: Principles of Accounting I and II). CPAs refer to the Prin -
ciples courses as “bookkeeping” courses. 
No interpretations:  Tax auditors do not interpret IRS guidelines or en -
gage in tax research. A “classifier" defines the auditor’s scope for the audit 
and the auditor follows a set of questions regarding the items the classifier 
identified. Often, the auditor looks at your return for the first time when 
you walk through the door and take your seat for the audit. 
The adding machine:  Tax auditors like to take your receipts, add them up, 
compare them to your return, and disallow any shortage. Tax auditors are 
not trained to know that you do not need receipts for travel and entertain -
ment under $75.00. 
Go to the audit naked: If your return is audited by a tax auditor who 
knows little about tax law, you may want to go to the audit by yourself (af -
ter consultation with your tax advisor). After all, why send a technical tax 
person who speaks a language that the IRS auditor will not understand? 
Revenue agents:  Revenue agents must have four-year college degrees and 
a minimum of 24 semester hours of accounting education or the equiva -
lent in experience. The revenue agent learns tax law from the IRS and 
handles your return the IRS way. 
Don’t go naked:  You need your tax advisor to speak the agent’s language 
and to ensure that you do not lose rightful deductions. Your tax advisor 
should attend the initial meeting when you deal with the revenue agent.

 259NotesDuring that meeting, your advisor will agree, preferably in writing, to the 
rules and procedures for your audit, including:
l Business hours to be observed
l Where the agent will work
l Agent access to machines, such as copiers
l Agent access to personnel, like your bookkeeper
Most good tax advisors limit the agent’s access to machines and people. 
Generally, your advisor gets the agent to explain what documents he or 
she needs and then acts to satisfy those needs. 
Protect your documents:  You should make two copies of all documents 
you give to the IRS (one for you and one for the IRS). That gives you a 
trail that you can follow later should that need develop.
Restrict access to machines:  You should not give the IRS free access to 
the copy machine and you should not allow the IRS to bring its own copy 
machine.
Restrict access to people:  You do not want the agent speaking in tax jar -
gon to your bookkeeper. If the agent has questions for the bookkeeper or 
other employee, try to get the questions in writing. Then have your book -
keeper answer the questions in writing, after review by your tax advisors 
so that there are no mistakes understanding the tax jargon. If the written 
response is not appropriate, your tax advisor should be present for the 
question-and-answer session to make sure your employee answers the 
questions that the IRS asks.
Beware of informants:  Recently, the IRS paid a record $5.3 million in 
informants’ fees to recover $172 million in taxes. A good return on in -
vestment, don’t you think? That year, the IRS paid an average reward of 
$6,340. More than 90 percent of the informants do not collect any money. 
For the $6,340 average, the IRS paid only 7 percent of the 11,393 infor -
mants. Most informants do not collect because they do not snitch for the 
money. They are mad at their employers, past employers, spouses, past 
spouses, or neighbors. The IRS does have about 800 controlled informants, 
of whom about 40 are accountants.1
As you would expect, the IRS makes informants pay tax on rewards as 
income for services rendered.2 As you can tell from the average award, the 
IRS is not a big spender. It places limits on most awards and sets the fol -
lowing guidelines:3
l For responsible information that results in recovery of tax, the re -
ward is 10 percent of the first $75,000 recovered, 5 percent of the 
next $25,000, and 1 percent of the balance (not to exceed a reward of 
$100,000).
260Notesl For information of value in recovering tax, the reward is 5 percent 
of the first $75,000 recovered, 2.5 percent of the next $25,000, and 1 
percent of the balance (not to exceed a reward of $100,000).
l For information that caused an investigation but had no value in find -
ing the tax due, the reward is 1 percent of the first $75,000 recovered 
and 0.5 percent of the balance (not to exceed a reward of $100,000).
You can negotiate snitch fees greater than the guidelines.4 
Strategy for the Audit
Overview:  Obviously, you should be ready for an IRS audit on the day 
you file your tax return. Your information should be complete, organized, 
and readily accessible. You should have notes and technical memoranda to 
support unusual or aggressive positions. 
Tips for the audit:  Once the audit is under way, you should abide by the 
following guidelines:
l Bring organized information that you can retrieve rapidly.
l Control the scope of the audit by bringing only those records 
requested.
l Do not volunteer information.
l Do not answer questions that the IRS did not ask.
l Stick to the subject and make sure you answer the examiner’s ques -
tions.
l Do not claim that the income tax is unconstitutional.
l Do not claim that the only legal tender is gold, therefore you do not 
owe any paper dollars in taxes.
l Give the examiner only the information he or she needs to answer the 
question.
l Do not take charge of the audit! Let the examiner ask the questions 
and decide which issues to cover.
l Allow the examiner to decide which adjustments, if any, to propose. 
If he or she proposes adjustments, you should try to use additional 
documentation to eliminate the adjustments.
l Do not panic before, during, or at the adjustment stage.
l Deliver your records with a smile (because you know that the burden 
of proof is on you).
l Do not chitchat or engage in small talk.
l Ask for the auditor’s supervisor if you know he or she is wrong on a 
technical point.
l Dress normally.
l Do not plead poverty or ignorance.
l Be early for all appointments.
l Never say: “I have always done it that way.”
l Do not praise the agent.
l Be businesslike.
 261Notesl Be prepared to answer economic questions regarding where you get 
the money to support your lifestyle.
l Do not give in to audit adjustments.
Planning tip:  The IRS Audit Manual  states: “Hasty agreement to adjust -
ments and undue concern about immediate closing of the case may indi -
cate a more thorough examination is needed.” If you appear soft, the IRS 
will try to get more from you. 
Review needed:  Most important, you need to review all proposed adjust -
ments. The IRS easily could be wrong. Look at technical books to make 
sure of the law . Ask your tax advisor about the proposed adjustments. 
Reducing Your Chances of IRS Audit
TCMP audits:  Currently the IRS is not conducting any Taxpayer Com -
pliance Measurement Program (TCMP) audits. This could change any -
time. Your return could be selected at random for the worst of all possible 
audits, the TCMP audit. The IRS uses this audit to develop statistics for its 
audit selection process. In the TCMP audit, the IRS examines every detail. 
It is time-consuming, costly, and an overall terrible experience for the tax -
payer. Your odds of a TCMP audit are very small.
Reduce chances of audit selection:  You can reduce your odds of regular 
audit selection by:
l Mailing your tax return by registered mail, return receipt requested.
l Mailing your return the day before the due date. Take no chance that 
the United States Post Office turned its postage meters ahead to the 
next day. They do that in Houston. At 8:00 p.m., the Houston Post 
Office turns its postage meter to the next day.5
l Writing the registered mail receipt number on the original return be -
fore you copy and mail it to the IRS.
l Adding supporting statements and photocopies of canceled checks, 
appraisals, and police reports to any claim of casualty or theft loss. 
(You should try to satisfy the IRS’s audit requirements for a casualty 
or theft deduction before you file your return.)
l Sending your changes of address to the IRS so that IRS notices arrive 
in a timely manner.
l Filing your return on time (extension dates are okay, but filing late for 
a regular return or for an extended return is a major problem). 
l Having a qualified tax advisor sign your return, such as a CPA or 
enrolled agent.
l Never using a dishonest tax return preparer (the IRS has a list).
l Reporting all income.
l Reporting some small miscellaneous income that displays your 
honesty.
262Notesl Not claiming unallowable deductions.
l Not claiming more than 14 withholding allowances. 
l Answering audit questions in advance.
Work for the IRS:  If you have an unusually high deduction or expense, 
you should add a supporting schedule that reveals the details. Next, you 
should answer audit questions in advance. You can look at the IRS Audit 
Manual  to find the questions. The manual is a public document and your 
tax advisor probably has a copy. By answering the questions in advance, 
you reduce the chances of a face-to-face visit with the IRS.
After the Audit
Settle quickly:  If you survive the audit with no adjustments or the govern -
ment owes you money, settle quickly. 
Disagree:  If the IRS wants money from you, you should disagree with the 
auditor’s findings and respond to the IRS’s 30-day letter. It takes a while 
for the IRS to send you your letter. The 30 days refers to the time you have 
after you receive the letter demanding adjustment, not how long it takes 
the IRS to send it to you.
Protests:  Depending on the size of the audit adjustment, you protest the 
audit findings to a supervisor or appeals officer. You must arrange or file 
your protest during the 30-day period after receipt of the so-called 30-day 
letter. When responding to any IRS notice by telephone, make sure you 
send a confirming letter to the IRS by registered mail, return receipt re -
quested. 
Notice of Deficiency:  If you do not agree with the IRS while discussing 
the 30-day letter, the IRS will send you a Notice of Deficiency, also known 
as the 90-day letter. In this notice, the IRS tells you that at the end of 90 
days it will assess the tax due. Thus, for you, the 90-day is an ultimatum. 
You may either pay the tax or take the IRS to court. 
Legal fees:  If the IRS took an unreasonable position that forced you to 
take the IRS to court to win your deductions, you may recover legal fees. 
The courts generally award up to $200 an hour for attorney fees plus ex -
penses when you can prove that the IRS position was not substantially jus -
tified.6 In special circumstances, and sometimes in more expensive areas, 
the courts award more than $200 an hour for fees. You may not recover 
legal fees if your net worth exceeds $2 million.
 263NotesYour rights:  You have rights as a taxpayer. Congress passed the Taxpayer 
Bill of Rights and those rights include, among others, the following:
l The IRS must explain your rights before starting the audit7 (such as by 
giving you a copy of the IRS publication on your rights).
l You have the statutory right to representation during the audit.8
l The IRS must stop the audit and let you consult your representative 
when you make the request.9
l The audit must take place at a reasonable time and place.10
l You may record the audit interviews.11
l The IRS must forego tax and penalties that arise from inaccurate 
“written” advice it gave you.12
l The IRS may not use quotas to evaluate the performance of collection 
employees.13
l If the IRS is unjustified, you may collect attorney fees and litigation 
costs.14
l You may sue the IRS for its agents’ reckless or intentional disregard of 
tax law .15
Some Final Thoughts
Unclaimed deductions:  While working on your audit evidence, it is likely 
that you will find some unclaimed deductions. Do not report them to the 
IRS when you find them. Wait until the end of the audit. That way the 
IRS will not be interested in trying to find more problems in your return to 
offset your new findings.
Never ignore an IRS notice:  Respond promptly to all notices and make 
sure you can prove that you responded by using registered mail.
Always file a tax return:  The penalties for failure to file far outweigh the 
penalties for failure to pay. Thus, even if you are short of money, you are 
better off filing.
Offer in Compromise: If you failed to file in the past, meet with a tax 
advisor to discuss an “Offer in Compromise” that you can send to the IRS. 
Since this is a compromise, you obviously offer less than you owe and the 
IRS might accept it. You need to get the offer ready before you let the IRS 
know what you intend to do. Thus, find a good advisor who has experi -
ence with such offers.

IRS Makes Deducting Start-Up 
Expenses Easier
Before explaining how the IRS just made your life easier, let’s briefly re -
view what defines a “start-up expense.” Basically, a start-up expense is an 
expense that would not be deductible without this special tax break which 
allows you to deduct both your “thinking about getting into business ex -
penses” and your “getting your business started expenses.”
Start Up of a New Business
You probably had not thought about deducting your “thinking about get -
ting into” business expenses. Most people don’t. But in the start-up classi -
fication, the “thinking about it” expenses qualify. 
If you started a business during the last three years, ask yourself these 
questions: Before beginning the business and while thinking about getting 
into this business, did you 
travel to meet with and learn from others who are in the business? l
go to lunch, dinner, movies, theater, or play golf with friends and  l
business acquaintances to find out about the business and learn if you 
might be good at the business? (If you paid only for yourself at these 
entertainments, your Dutch-treat cost qualifies for deduction just as if 
you had picked up the tab.)
take classes in or out of town to learn more about the business? l
spend money analyzing the market and how it looks for the future? l
buy books and magazines to find information about the market? l
use your car to make prospecting and other calls before getting your  l
license or meeting the other qualifications necessary to enter the 
business?
obtain training for the new business (excluding the training to qualify  l
for entry into the new business)?
make long-distance telephone calls to others to learn more about the  l
business and how you might fit into the business?
These types of costs qualify as start-up expenses. The list clearly reveals 
that without this special write-off provision you would get nothing. This is 
one of those tax-law rules that makes you like lawmakers.
266NotesStart-up expenses also include expenditures you make for any of the fol -
lowing:1 
Surveying or analyzing potential markets, products, labor supply,  l
transportation, and other aspects of the business
Advertisements for the opening of your business l
Salaries and wages for employees you train and their instructors l
Travel and other necessary costs for securing prospective distributors,  l
suppliers, or customers
Salaries and fees for executives and consultants, or for similar profes -  l
sional services
How Things Got Easier
Now, in addition to thanking lawmakers for start-up deductions, you have 
the regulatory IRS to thank for making it easier to realize the cash benefits 
from your start-up deductions. Beginning with start-up expenses incurred 
after September 8, 2008, you no longer have to make that exacting election 
under Section 195 to qualify start-up expenses for deduction.2 
Don’t let that September 8 date throw a road block in your path. The 
“no election needed” requirement is also effective for your prior open tax 
years.3 Therefore, if you failed to make the election in a prior year, you 
can use the new rules in effect after September 8 to amend that prior year 
if that prior year is an open tax year (generally, the year is open for three 
years from the day you mail the return to the IRS).
Under the new rules, you do not make an election to write off your start-
up expenses. Instead, the regulations make that election for you automati -
cally. You have to love this: the new regulations “deem” that you made the 
start-up election unless you expressly elect out of these tax-favored start-up 
write-offs.4
Planning tip:  We can think of no logical reason not to write off your start-
up expenses. 
How the Write Off Works
Under the new rules, the write-off method of deducting start-up expenses 
remains as is. In the taxable year you begin an active trade or business, 
you deduct the lesser of what you spent on start-up or $5,000 reduced (but 
not below zero) by the amount by which the start-up expenditures exceed 
$50,000.5 You deduct the remainder using straight-line amortization over 
the 180-month period beginning with the month in which your active 
trade or business started.6 
 267NotesExample:  You spend $21,740 on start-up. You write off $5,000 on the day 
the business starts and amortize the remaining $16,740 at $93 a month 
over 180 months.
If you sell or discontinue the business before the 180 months expires, you 
write off the unamortized start up at that time.
Now that you know about this new and easy-to-use write-off of start-up 
expenses, ask yourself these questions:
Did you deduct your start-up expenses? l
Did you incorrectly claim start-up expenses as business expenses? l
If you got either of these wrong, now is the time to get these corrected. 
When Does the Business Start?
You begin deducting start-up expenses in the month your business begins. 
In determining what month your business begins, a good rule of thumb is 
the month you start making your first sales calls, see your first patients, or 
have customers come into your place of business.7
Example:  Sam Jones spent $150,000 over three years to develop a service-
assessment system. He deducted the $150,000 on Schedule C. In case the 
expenses were not deductible, he added a note to his tax return saying that 
the expenses may be start-up expenses. Jones made zero sales and was 
constantly changing his product. In technical advice, the IRS ruled that 
Jones may neither deduct the $150,000 nor treat it as a start-up expense, 
because he never actually started the business.8
 
Planning note:  Had Jones created one product or service then worked at 
selling that one product or service, he would have had a business and his 
$150,000 tax write-off, even if he never made any sales.
If you do not qualify to be in business or the law prohibits you from start -
ing the business, you are not in business.9 A suspended broker did not 
incur tax-deductible costs when seeking reinstatement, because he was not 
in business.10 
Robert L. Duecaster, a high school teacher, attempted to deduct his law 
school tuition and other costs as start-up costs for his law practice. Wrong! 
The court ruled that Duecaster gets no deduction for the educational ex -
penses because the education was necessary to qualify him to practice law, 
not to start a business.11 The law school expenses were personal.
Ignoring the fact that you cannot deduct your costs of getting the creden -
tials necessary to get into your business, think of how this start-up law 
268Notesgrants you benefits for thinking about and investigating the beginning of 
your business. Lawmakers have made it clear that they want you to get 
into business and help grow this economy.
What Happens to the Costs of an Unsuccessful 
Search?
When a corporation abandons an unsuccessful search for a new business, 
it may deduct the costs of investigating the venture as a loss.12
Planning tip:  If this loss puts the corporation out of business, your stock 
in the corporation becomes worthless, and you may claim the worthless 
stock as a capital loss. In general, stock losses produce capital losses. How -
ever, with a Section 1244 election on small business stock, your loss on 
this stock is a more favorable ordinary loss.
If you, as an individual, abandon your search, you do not receive such 
favorable treatment.13 The IRS ruled that individuals may deduct losses 
for a new business search only when they do more than investigate. You 
must enter a transaction for profit and later abandon the transaction.14 The 
IRS has ruled that you enter a transaction for profit when you go beyond a 
general investigatory search and focus on the acquisition of a specific busi -
ness investment. 
Thus, you may deduct costs incurred in an unsuccessful search when you 
identify and focus on a specific business.15 Documents that help you prove 
identification include agreements, profit-and-loss projections, and advice 
from professionals about a specific business. 
Planning tip:  You may not deduct losses incurred in the general investiga -
tory search.16 The IRS declares that such a loss is personal.
Expansion of Existing Business
You may deduct as current expenses the costs of expanding your existing 
business.17 Obviously, the key is to have an existing trade or business that 
you can expand.18 The IRS and the courts have ruled that the following 
costs are deductible as business-expansion expenses:
l Developing a new sales territory19
l Promotional activities to increase sales20
l Start-up of new equipment for existing business21
l Expenses of a residential developer investigating development of in -
dustrial sites22
l Addition of new branches by a bank23
 269NotesIf you start a new line of business, you treat the expenses of start-up under 
the start-up rules.24 Defining a new line of business is a question of fact 
that is not always easily resolved. 
Example:  Fragrance, Inc., manufactures and imports fragrances and 
cosmetics. At first it sold its goods only at the wholesale level. Later, to 
broaden its base, the company opened a retail boutique. The store was a 
great success. The company then opened 11 more retail stores. 
IRS Ruling:  In technical advice, the IRS ruled that25
l the company’s first retail boutique was a new business; and 
l the 11 additional boutiques were simply an expansion of an existing 
business.
Thus, the company would treat the costs of opening the first boutique as 
start-up expenses; however, the costs of getting the other 11 boutiques up 
and running are those most tax-favored ordinary business expenses, de -
ductible as incurred.
Three Cautions for Start-Up Expenses
Caution 1. Purchasing an Existing Business
When you start or enter a business from scratch, you can easily identify 
start-up expenses as those incurred before you make your first sales calls or 
list your property for rent. However, when you take over an existing busi -
ness, your tax life is more complicated. For an existing business, start-up 
costs include only the costs that help you seek a business, review busi -
nesses, and decide which one to purchase. Once you have identified your 
target, you incur capital acquisition costs that do not qualify for start-up 
treatment.26
Example:  You hire an accounting firm and a law firm to assist you in the 
potential purchase of Jimmy Company. The firms research the industry 
and analyze the financial projections of Jimmy Company. On the basis of 
this information, you have the law firm prepare and submit a letter of your 
intent to buy Jimmy Company. The letter states that a binding commit -
ment will result only after a purchase agreement is signed. The law firm 
and accounting firm continue to provide services, including a review of 
Jimmy Company’s books and records and the preparation of a purchase 
agreement. After the review, you sign the agreement to buy Jimmy Com -
pany.
You have start-up costs only to investigate the business before submitting 
the letter of intent. Once you submit the letter of intent, your legal, ac -
270Notescounting, and other expenses to purchase this existing business are capital 
costs.27 
Caution 2. Failure to Identify and Buy the Business
The expenses are personal if you (1) did not identify or (2) did not buy a 
specific business. You get no deductions because28
l no business exists to produce start-up deductions, and 
l no loss exists because you did not identify a specific acquisition.
Caution 3. Investments, Corporations
You must spend money to investigate or create an “active” trade or busi -
ness. Money you spend to look into investments does not qualify for tax-
favored start-up treatment.29
In the case of rentals as active businesses, the Senate has said that, in 
general, your operation of an apartment complex, office building, or shop -
ping center qualifies as an active business.30 The Senate further stated that 
rentals in which you furnish significant services incident to the rentals con -
stitute an active business.31 
The word “active” means that you, your corporation, or your partnership 
participates in the management of the trade or business.32 The special 
treatment of start-up expenses goes to the taxpayer who incurs the start-up 
costs and enters the trade or business.33
A sole proprietor claims start-up costs on his Schedule C for a new busi -
ness.34
A C corporation or an S Corporation claims its start-up expenses on its 
corporate return.35
In general, if you’re starting a business using a corporation, you need 
to differentiate clearly among investment, start-up, and organization 
expenses. Start-up and organization costs both qualify for the $5,000 and 
180-month amortization, but investment expenses are capital expendi -
tures. 
Also, keep in mind that the corporation is a legal entity separate from you. 
You may not deduct expenses paid on behalf of another, so make sure the 
corporation pays the corporate expenses. If you pay any of the corporate 
expenses, make sure that the corporation reimburses you for the expenses.

Tax Planning in the Event Your 
Business Loses Money
Overview:  Should you incur a tax loss in any tax year, you want that activity 
classed as a business activity so that you can deduct your losses. Tax law gives 
no loss deductions for activities not carried on to make a profit.1 Activities 
you do as a hobby, or mainly for sport or recreation, come under this limit.2
Application of the hobby rules:  The limit on not-for-profit losses applies to 
individuals, partnerships, estates, trusts, and S corporations.3 It does not apply 
to corporations other than S corporations.4
Planning tip 1:  Incorporate to avoid the hobby-loss rules.
Planning tip 2:  Invest money in the corporation up front and treat the stock 
as Section 1244 stock to avoid problems. Then, if the business fails, you can 
deduct your initial investment on your personal return not as a capital loss 
limited to $3,000 a year, but as a fully deductible ordinary loss.
Planning note:  The 1244 election that produces ordinary losses applies only 
to the original investment. Your additional investments produce capital losses 
subject to the $3,000 annual limit. 
Best bet:  Schedule C losses are fully deductible business losses. You can have 
a Schedule C loss deduction if you can prove that your activity is a business 
and not a hobby. You prove business activity by meeting some of the tests that 
follow (the more you meet the better your proof).
Expectation of profit:  Although the IRS does not require a “reasonable ex -
pectation of profit,” your facts and circumstances must show that you entered 
the activity, or continued the activity, with the objective of making a profit.5 
The IRS grants a profit motive if you prove that you have a small chance of 
making a large profit.6
Intent:  Whether your business meets the test to be a business is a question of 
fact that depends on an analysis of your intent as determined from all facts 
and circumstances.7 
Desire income:  To be a business, you must be involved in your activity with 
continuity and regularity and your primary purpose for the activity must be 
for income or profit. A sporadic activity, a hobby, or an amusement diversion 
does not qualify as a business.8
274NotesPresumption of profit:  The IRS presumes you carry on your activity for 
profit if it produces a profit in at least three of the last five tax years, including 
the current year.9 You can rely on this presumption every time, unless the IRS 
shows it is not valid.10
Proving profit intent when you have losses:  If you fail the three-out-of-five 
test, you may still deduct losses if you can prove that your activity operated as 
a business. The IRS lists nine factors that may be important in establishing a 
profit motive. 
1. Businesslike manner:  The fact that you carry on your activity in a busi -
nesslike manner and maintain complete and accurate books and records may 
show that the activity is engaged in for profit.11 You look more businesslike 
when you:
l Have a separate business checking account
l Have a separate business credit card
l Keep monthly financial statements
l Prepare an annual budget for the business
2. Expertise:  You help your profit motive when you study accepted business 
practices for your activity and consult with those who are expert therein.12 
You especially help your cause when you carry on your activity as directed by 
the experts. Failure to follow expert advice suggests lack of profit intent, un -
less you can show that your new or superior techniques may produce profits.13
3. Time and effort:  The fact that the taxpayer devotes much of his time and 
effort to carrying on an activity, particularly if the activity does not have 
substantial personal or recreational aspects, may show an intention to derive a 
profit.14 If you depend on income from your activity for your livelihood, you 
show strong intent to make a profit.15 
Planning note:  Almost anything you do for the sole purpose of putting food 
on the table makes a for-profit endeavor. 
4. Asset appreciation:  The IRS accepts profit from appreciation as part of 
your profit motive.16 In other words, if you expect to lose money on rents, but 
make money on the increase in value of the property, you have a profit mo -
tive.
5. Prior success:  The fact that the taxpayer has engaged in similar activities 
in the past and converted them from unprofitable to profitable enterprises 
may show that he is engaged in the present activity for profit, even though the 
activity is presently unprofitable.17
6. Income and loss history:  A series of losses during start-up does not mean 
your activity is not engaged in for profit.18 However, when losses continue be -
yond the period ordinarily required to make the activity profitable, that excess 
period may suggest that your activity is not being engaged in for profit.19 
275NotesPlanning note:  A series of years when your activity produces net income 
would, of course, be strong evidence that the activity is engaged in for profit.20
7. Occasional profits:  An occasional small profit compared to large losses 
does not show that you engaged in the activity to make a profit.21 However, 
substantial profit, though only occasional, suggests that an activity is engaged 
in for profit.22 Moreover, an opportunity to earn a substantial ultimate profit 
in a highly speculative venture indicates that the activity is engaged in for 
profit even though you generate only losses.23 
8. Your other income:  If you attempt to make a living from your activity, 
you usually establish a profit motive and can deduct your losses. Substantial 
income from sources other than your activity may suggest that you engaged in 
a not-for-profit activity, especially if that activity involves substantial personal 
or recreational elements, like golf.24 
9. Personal pleasure or recreation:  Your personal motives for the activity 
may suggest that the activity is not engaged in for profit, especially when it in -
volves recreational or personal elements.25 On the other hand, an activity that 
lacks any appeal other than profit suggests a profit motive.26 However, your 
intent to derive profit does not  have to be your exclusive or sole intent.27 You 
can have a for-profit motive combined with purposes or motivations other 
than solely to make a profit.28 Also, the fact that you derive personal pleasure 
from the activity does not make the activity not for profit if you engaged in it 
for profit as evidenced by other factors, whether or not listed above.29
Planning note:  If your activity involves recreation, you must pay attention to 
the profit motive or the IRS could take your deductions under the personal-
pleasure motive. 
Hobby-loss limits:  If tax law classes your activity as a hobby:
l The law limits your deductions to no more than your income from the 
hobby30
l The law reduces your deductions by 2 percent of adjusted gross in -
come—because you report your hobby on Schedule A31 
Moreover, you may not carry over any unused losses from the current year to 
any future year.32 You want to avoid the hobby results because the results are 
truly ugly.
Planning tip:  Make your activity a business, have fun, and enjoy your profits. 
That way, should you experience a few loss years, you secure your loss deduc -
tions. 
Filing tip:  Do not agree to make a profit in three of the first five years by 
filing IRS Form 5213. Instead, make your activity a business, keep good 
records, and attempt to make a profit. Unlike a hobby, if you fail to make a 
profit in your business, you may deduct your losses. 
276NotesWorking example:  Horses are not a hobby for a computer programmer. 
Michael Shane worked full time as a computer programmer. In addition, he 
raised, bred, and raced horses. His horse activities lost money and the IRS 
classed the activity as a hobby. Shane won his loss deductions in court be -
cause he:33
l Conducted his horse activity in a businesslike manner
l Saved money by operating the horse activity from his personal checking 
account (generally, you should have a separate business account to make 
your activity look like a business)
l Redirected operations in attempts to stop losing and start making money
l Developed expertise in horses and racing
l Spent substantial time and effort on his horses and racing
l Expected his horses to appreciate 
l Allowed no one, not even himself, to ride his horses other than qualified 
jockeys
Lesson:  Shane had a business because he conducted his activity as business, 
even though it gave him great personal pleasure. Get maximum benefit and 
personal pleasure—conduct your activity as a business!

Answers to Questions
179 Deduction for S Corporation Produces Less 
Cash Benefit
Every year, I buy about $50,000 of equipment for my business. I always 
claim the Section 179 deduction for the entire $50,000. I incorporated 
my business last year and claimed the Section 179 deduction on the S 
corporation return. This seemed to produce less of a tax benefit than 
when I claimed the deduction on my personal return. Where is the best 
place for the Section 179 deduction?     (T .B.M., Watsonville, CA)   
When you had the business personally, you claimed the income and 
expenses on Schedule C of your IRS Form 1040. Say you had income of 
$100,000 last year and you claimed a $50,000 Section 179 deduction. The 
deduction would produce a tax benefit of $19,182.
With your S corporation, the Section 179 deduction comes to your per -
sonal return as a K-1 line item, which offsets your income. With $100,000 
of S corporation income, your Section 179 deduction would produce a tax 
benefit of only $13,259.
Why the $5,923 cash difference? For an individual businessperson report -
ing on Schedule C of your Form 1040, the Section 179 deduction reduces 
both your income and self-employment taxes. The K-1 reduces only your 
income tax. 
Planning tip:  Before incorporating, consider all the benefits and draw -
backs. Your best bet is a side-by-side analysis of dollar savings and losses 
by incorporating. This is a great exercise for your tax advisor and a worth -
while expenditure of tax advisory fees by you. 
W-2 for Section 105 Plan
Do I have to report the Section 105 medical reimbursements on a Form 
W-2?     (L.F.P ., Carmel, IN)
No. IRS Publication 15, (Circular E) Employer’s Tax Guide , states that 
reimbursements under an employer’s self-insurance plan are not wages. The questions answered in this section 
are from our questions e-mail.

Further, the W-2 specifically excludes a block for reporting this nontaxable 
fringe benefit. 
Both CPA and IRS Wrong
Thank goodness I have taken your course. Last week, I took my CPA 
along as I marched down to the IRS office for an audit. During the au -
dit, the IRS rejected my home-office deduction because I have a shared 
office at the Coldwell Banker real estate office where I am an agent. 
My use of the Coldwell Banker office consists of floor duty once every 
other week and attendance at sales meetings twice a month. All my 
other work is done at my home office, including all my administrative 
and management duties. I use my home office exclusively for business 
on a regular basis. 
As you can see, I know the rules for the home office. Well, here is what 
happened. First, my CPA agreed with the IRS that I should not get a 
home-office deduction because Coldwell Banker gives me an office. Sec -
ond, they both agreed that Soliman  (the case where the anesthesiologist 
worked at three hospitals and lost his home office) controlled my deduc -
tion. I think both my CPA and the IRS are wrong. Can you help me out 
here?     (F.W ., Pahoa, HI)
Your CPA is a disappointment. He or she has not been keeping up with 
the rules. Because they found Soliman  truly unfair, lawmakers changed the 
rules in 1997. However, because of a lack of money, lawmakers made the 
new rules effective on January 1, 1999. The rules that became effective in 
1999, six years ago, explicitly authorize more than one office.1
To see this authorization and gather some ammunition for your audit, go 
to the IRS website at www .irs.go v and retrieve IRS Publication 587, Busi-
ness Use of  Your Home , in PDF format. Go to page 3 and look in the lower 
righthand column under Principal Office and you will find these words: 
You can have more than one business location, including your home, for a single 
trade or business.  
Thus, right from the IRS’s own publication, you have your position in 
writing. You may want to offer both your CPA and the IRS auditor the 
opportunity to eat their words on the more-than-one-office rule. But hold 
on—we have more for you. 
Stay right where you are in this IRS publication and move down this 
column about an inch or so, and you will find these words: Your home office 
will qualify as your principal place of  business if  you meet the following require -
ments.
278Notes
You use it exclusively and regularly for administrative or management 
activities of your trade or business.
You have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial adminis -
trative or management activities of your trade or business.
These words were enacted to overturn the harsh and unfair results of the 
Soliman  case. On page 5 of this publication, you will find Paul, an anesthe -
siologist, who has exactly the same attributes Soliman had when he lost 
his case in the Supreme Court in 1993. But now, because lawmakers found 
Soliman  unfair, Paul wins his deductions. 
In summary, you win your home-office deduction. Both your CPA and the 
IRS are dead wrong and definitely behind the times with their outdated 
information. Obsolete knowledge is not uncommon, even among profes -
sionals; that’s why it’s important to protect yourself with your own solid 
base of tax knowledge.
Deducting Golf
How do I deduct the golf when I have a business discussion on the golf 
course with a prospect? (Z.H. Venice, FL)
If you want to deduct the golf, you need to move the business discussion 
to the clubhouse. Discussing business only on the golf course puts your 
golf deductions in jeopardy because you are in direct conflict with IRS 
regulation 1.274-1(c)(7), which says that it presumes the distractions on 
the golf course are too great to qualify your discussion during the golf 
game as an entertainment deduction.
You’ll like the solution. It’s easy. Have a business discussion with the 
prospect over lunch or snacks in the clubhouse before, or after the golf. 
Document that discussion in your diary. You want this discussion to have 
the possibility of giving you a specific business benefit (like turning the 
prospect into a customer). In your diary documentation, be specific about 
the business-benefit intent.
By doing this in the clubhouse, you put yourself on the right side of two 
different IRS regulations, either of which is going to grant you a “directly 
related” entertainment deduction for the meal or snack consumed dur -
ing the discussion. Now that you have this directly related entertainment 
deduction, you can precede or follow it with golf that qualifies for deduc -
tion as associated entertainment. 2 In other words, the golf is deductible 
because it is connected with the discussion in the clubhouse.
 279Notes
105 Medical Plan
My wife is going to hire me to work in her proprietorship. My medical 
plan is through Kaiser. To get the best pricing, I am buying one plan to 
cover my wife and child and a separate plan to cover myself. Kaiser will 
bill me for the premiums. Once a month, I am going to turn in all the 
family medical bills to my employer-wife, who is going to reimburse me 
for the medical. Is this an acceptable setup to make my employer-wife’s 
Section 105 medical plan deductible on her tax return?     (M.S., Santa 
Rosa, CA)
Yes, more than acceptable—this looks about perfect.
 
Your wife (the employer-spouse) reimburses you (the employee) for all 
medical. She will have proof that she is reimbursing medical based on the 
invoices, copies of paid checks, and so on. That’s excellent.
All insurance is in your name—you, the employee. She is simply a mem -
ber of the family for purposes of the insurance, which is in your name. 
Again, excellent!
Selling the Corporate-Deducted Home
When I sell the home for which I received corporate reimbursement for 
home office use, do I owe the business any money? Do the rules work 
just as if I had deducted the home personally?    (M.W ., Enfield, CT)
You owe the corporation nothing. Your position at the time of sale is iden -
tical to the position you would be in had you claimed the deduction for a 
home office personally. 
Wages and 105 Plan
My CPA told me that I have to pay my wife a wage if I want to cover 
her with the Section 105 plan. Is this true?     (G.S., Burnsville, MN)
No. In fact, this confuses many people. In Section 16 of this course, we 
discusssed the Speltz  case,3 in which Maureen Speltz won her Section 105 
medical plan deduction. 
Two points from your question are answered in Speltz : 
Maureen Speltz paid her husband Peter a zero cash wage. l
The court ruled that the fringe benefit of the 105 plan was reasonable  l
compensation for the services provided by Peter Speltz. 
280Notes
To see if your wife’s compensation is reasonable, divide the cost of your 
105 fringe benefit by the number of hours your wife will work. For ex -
ample, say your wife is going to work 350 hours during the year and the 
cost of your 105 medical plan is $8,500. That produces an hourly rate of 
remuneration of $24.29. If that’s too high, find more work for your wife. 
You want this benefit to represent a reasonable rate of pay.
Keep in mind that you are paying a zero cash wage to your wife. This is 
great. You and your family get the medical benefit and you avoid having a 
payroll, payroll taxes, and all that related payroll mess. 
IRS Inspects Home Office
Does the IRS ever make a physical inspection of the home office as part 
of an audit?     (C.O.T ., Traverse City , MI)
Internal Revenue Manual (the IRS audit guide) Section 4.10.3.3.5.1, In-
spection of  the Business in the Home , states:
When determining the validity of  office in the home deductions, the office or 
business should be toured as any other business site. In order for any portion of  a 
personal residence to qualify, it must be used exclusively  for business purposes. This 
can only be determined by inspecting the business portion of  the residence.
So the answer to your question is yes, the IRS tells its examiners to look at 
home offices. Ask yourself how your office would look in a viewing by the 
IRS. Does it look like an office exclusively used for business? It should.
If you no longer own the home, how would you prove exclusive use? Pho -
tographs of your home office are always valuable. Take them annually and 
note the date they were taken.
Home Office for Corporation
What does the IRS audit manual say about the home office for an indi -
vidual who operates her business as a corporation?     (S.T .A., Tallahas -
see, FL)
You will be interested in two boilerplate explanations from the Internal 
Revenue Manual that examiners use to explain why the IRS is denying the 
home-office deductions:4
We (the IRS) have disallowed your deductions for office in the home expense 1. 
because you have not established that it was for the convenience of  your 
employer. Voluntary, vocational, or incidental use of  part of  your home in 
connection with your employment does not entitle you to a business deduction.
 281Notes
If  you rent all or part of  your residence to your employer and use the rented 2. 
portion when performing services for the employer, you cannot deduct home-
office expenses attributable to the rental.
If you want to avoid the disallowances above and achieve a full deduction 
for the home office, follow these directions:
Make your corporation write you a letter stating that you must find  l
office space and that space may be in your home.
Do not rent the office in your home to your corporation. l
Complete IRS Form 8829 showing your home-office expenses for the  l
year. Do not file this form with your tax return. Instead, give the form 
to your corporation as the basis for corporate reimbursement to you 
for the home-office expenses. 
Do not report reimbursed employee expenses as taxable income.  l
Your corporation gets the deduction for its reimbursement of your em -
ployee expenses. But with this deduction comes the need for proof. Make 
sure you submit proof that backs up the deduction to your corporation; for 
example,
receipts for expenses, l
photos that show the office set up for exclusive business use, and l
a log book, for at least a sample period, that shows use of the office  l
for more than 10 hours a week.
Business Airplane
I purchased a Cessna 182-92895 for $80,000 on December 30 and used 
it for business that day . I am a licensed real estate professional, paying 
dues to a variety of real estate boards and associations in North Carolina 
and Florida. I plan to use the plane to take photos of properties for sale 
and to show prospects properties from the air. My accountant does not 
like my airplane. What do you think?     (H.L. Sanford, NC)
We like your airplane. Your accountant should like your airplane too. It al -
lows you to do what you like best: play while you work and get deductions 
for the work.
The airplane is Section 179 property eligible for expensing. Thus, you have 
several choices: Write it all off or write some of it off and depreciate the 
remainder at rates of 20 percent in year one, 32 percent in year two, and so 
on. (You write off the business percentage only.)
You need to keep a flight log for the next six years on this plane to prove 
your business use.5 You could have 100 percent this year and 60 percent 
business use next year without worrying about recapture of any Section 
179 deductions. Thus, if you wrote the whole thing off this year and then 
282Notes
had 60 percent business use next year, no problem. But if you had only 45 
percent business use next year, you would have to recapture the original 
write-off and depreciate the airplane using the straight-line method.
It seems that you have plenty of opportunities for business use, such as
searching properties from the air; l
taking photos of properties and neighborhoods; l
taking prospects up to view properties from the air; l
showing, taking photos, and viewing damage after floods, tornados,  l
and hurricanes; and
traveling to educational courses anywhere in the tax-defined North  l
American area.
As for the Tax Strategies for the Self-Employed  course, we are delighted that 
you are realizing the benefits and getting a lot from our program. That was 
our intent. Thanks for the feedback. 
C Corporation Golf Problem
Because I don’t keep the best records, I decided that I would operate as 
a C corporation. I am in discussions with the IRS regarding my docu -
mentation of entertainment that involved playing golf. I did not write 
anything down at the time I played golf, but I explained that I discussed 
business on the golf course with these people. What do you think is go -
ing to happen?     (A.N., Livonia, MI)
You are going to be miserable!
Two bad things are going to happen. First, your corporation is going to 
lose the golf deductions because you did not follow the rules. You were 
supposed to write down your business reason for the entertainment within 
one week of the expenditure. Also, your discussions failed the business-
setting test. So, for these reasons your corporation is going to lose the 
deduction. But this is only the first of your two problems. 
Your second problem is that the IRS is going to claim that you got per -
sonal benefit from the golf; therefore, the IRS is going to make your corpo -
rate-paid golf expenses a constructive dividend to you. 
Your documentation failure makes the law bite you in two ways. First, 
your corporation loses the deduction and must pay taxes on this lost de -
duction. Second, the lost golf deduction is a constructive dividend, giving 
you taxable-dividend income. 
 283Notes
Your misery is complete. You have been double-taxed for this mistake.6
Hopefully, this is a lesson. From this moment forward, keep contempora -
neous records.
Letter Requiring Home Office
Do you have a sample letter I can use to have my corporation require me 
to use a home office?   (M.W ., Enfield, CT)
No, we don’t have a sample letter, but this answer will give you what you 
need. Also, remember, you would not need any type of letter if you reported 
your income and expenses as a proprietorship on Schedule C. What triggers 
your need for the letter is your employee standing with your corporation.
You might have a variety of reasons for having the corporation require you 
to work at home. For example, some office buildings do not operate the 
heating or cooling on weekends or after hours. You may need to work dur -
ing these times, and that could be a reason for the corporation to require 
you to have another office. 
Similarly, your business neighborhood may not be the safest place after 
dark. Your corporation could deem it necessary that you work after dark.
Your corporation may deem it inappropriate for you to do your adminis -
trative work at the office, because it wants sales production during business 
hours. Therefore, the corporation requires you to do your administration 
at another location, like an office in your home. 
When composing the letter, try to keep two things in mind. First, you 
want a good reason why you, the employee, should work at home. 
Second, you want this reason to make your work at home a convenience 
for your corporate employer.
Your letter from your corporation to yourself might go like this: “The 
corporation desires the services of M.W . more than eight hours a day 
and further desires that M.W . spend his time inside the corporate walls 
only attending to sales and production activities. This will encourage the 
other workers to model after M.W . and be more productive. Therefore, 
the corporation requires that M.W . obtain an administrative office outside 
the corporate walls, and the corporation shall reimburse M.W . for these 
expenses.”
This letter should satisfy the requirement set forth in the code and by the 
IRS in its home-office publication, which states that “your business use 
must be for the convenience of your employer.”7
284Notes
The easy way to seek reimbursement from the corporation is to complete 
IRS Form 8829 and submit it to the corporation for reimbursement. IRS 
regulation Section 1.62-2(d)(1) allows the corporation to reimburse the 
employee for all the expenses that appear on the home-office deduction 
form. Because these are reimbursed employee expenses, the employee 
does not report them as income. 
Proper accounting by the employee includes reducing the itemized deduc -
tion for mortgage interest and property taxes to the net expense incurred 
after receiving the corporate reimbursement. For example, if mortgage 
interest for the year is $20,000 and the corporation reimburses $2,000, the 
employee should claim only $18,000 as a mortgage interest deduction on 
the return. 
Medical When You Have Two Businesses
We have two corporations: one in Texas and one in Nevada. The Texas 
corporation has five employees besides my husband and myself. The 
Nevada corporation has only my husband and me as employees. Can 
we establish a Section 105 medical reimbursement plan in the Nevada 
corporation without granting a similar benefit to the employees of the 
Texas corporation?     (P .O. El Paso, TX)
No. For purposes of the medical discrimination rules, tax law does a huge 
roundup of all your businesses and all your spouse’s businesses, including 
corporations, proprietorships, and LLCs, and makes them one business.8 
Thus, if you want a medical reimbursement plan at the Nevada corpora -
tion, you must provide the same medical reimbursement plan at the Texas 
corporation.
Doctor-Prescribed Golf
I have played golf for years, and now I would like my doctor to pre -
scribe golf as the exercise I need for my heart. If I can get such a pre -
scription, which I am sure I can, may I then deduct the golf as a medical 
expense?     (S.F., Wayne, IN)
No, forget it. You have two problems. First, you are already a golfer, so 
the prescribed treatment would require nothing new on your part. Second, 
you have no medical reason that makes golf the exercise needed for your 
heart. 
 285Notes
The courts distinguish personal expenditures beneficial to your general 
health from expenses for the prevention or alleviation of a physical defect 
or illness. In Seymour , the court noted that the physician prescription does 
not, by itself, make for a medical expense deduction.9 
Leon Altman tried to deduct his trips to the golf course because two physi -
cians recommended golf for his pulmonary emphysema, which had totally 
disabled him. No deduction, ruled the court. Altman had played golf 
before he became disabled, and thus the court could find no direct correla -
tion between the golf and the medical need.10 
105 Deduction for Back Chair
I hurt my back. For the past year, I have seen doctors and chiropractors 
and have gotten some relief. But I still have pain almost daily . I recently 
bought a fancy back chair for $1,800, and it seems to help with the pain. 
As a piece of furniture, this chair is useless. The front sticks out so that 
you trip walking by . Getting in and out of the chair is a trick. Is the cost 
of this chair (which my wife hates, but I love) deductible as a medical 
expense? If it’s deductible as a medical expense, can I have my Section 
105 plan reimburse the cost to me (thus making this chair a business 
expense)?     (A.P ., San Rafael, Calif.)
Maybe. Revenue ruling 58-155 said that the cost of a reclining chair in -
tended to give rest to a taxpayer with a cardiac condition was deductible if 
the taxpayer could prove that the chair
was prescribed by the cardiac specialist;  l
served no purpose other than the mitigation of the physical condition  l
of the patient; and 
was not to be used generally as an article of furniture. l
If you can meet the criteria laid out in this revenue ruling, you would have 
a lock on the deduction. 
Thus, we recommend that you get a prescription or a least a written recom -
mendation for the chair from either the physician or the chiropractor, and 
that you build proof that this chair would not be used generally as an article 
of furniture. Perhaps you are the only one in the family that reclines in it. 
Deduction for Family Wedding
I am planning to travel to a family wedding in New York. While there, 
I plan to discuss business with one or more people. Are all the trip 
286Notes
expenses deductible? Are travel expenses 100 percent deductible? What 
about the meals in connection with the travel?     (A.L., Fremont, CA)
First, travel to a family wedding is probably not going to be deductible, 
regardless of the time spent discussing business at the wedding. So forget 
that. But let’s see how you can get a deduction and attend the wedding, 
too.
First, you have to prove that your trip to New York is primarily for busi -
ness purposes.11 Say you travel from California to New York on Wednes -
day. On Thursday, you adjust for the time change. On Friday, you go to a 
sales seminar that lasts a minimum of four hours and one minute.12 You 
do the same on Monday. On Tuesday, you travel home.
On Friday night, you attend the rehearsal dinner.
On Saturday, you attend the wedding.
The result: You deduct Wednesday, Thursday, and Tuesday as business 
travel days.13 You deduct Friday and Monday as business training days. 
You deduct Saturday and Sunday as necessary business stay-over days.14 
You have made all your days business days. On a business day, you deduct 
breakfast, lunch, dinner, lodging, and all other costs of sustaining life on 
the road.
This is how you can get legitimate deductions for your trip and attend the 
wedding festivities, too.
Coffee for Employees
May I deduct the cost of coffee and sodas I provide for my employees? If 
so, is this subject to the 50 percent cut?     (T.E., Lexington Park, MD)  
Yes, you may deduct the cost of the coffee and sodas as a de minimus  fringe 
benefit.15 In fact, you deduct the full cost. The 50 percent cut on business 
meals and entertainment does not apply to the coffee-and-sodas fringe 
benefit.16

Assessment of Risk for In-
Hospital Suicide andAggression in High-Dependency CareEnvironments
Leslie Rittenmeyer, RN, PsyD, CNS, CNE
KEYWORDS
 In-hospital suicide  Aggression
 High-dependency environments  Staff training
The primary concern in any clinical setting is patient safety. Owing to variability in the
characteristics of the patient population, the critical care environment presents itsown unique set of safety challenges. This article addresses two of those: risk ofin-hospital (outside the psychiatric unit) suicide and potential for family or patientaggression.
CRITICAL CARE ENVIRONMENT
Stress in the critical care environment has been widely reported.1–4For most patients
and their signiﬁcant others, admission to a high-dependency unit constitutes a crisis.Crisis often occurs when a series of events happen that creates a situation that isperceived as threatening. The physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses tothese feelings will vary from person to person because aside from their personalproperty, all patients bring with them their own unique coping abilities, strengths,constraints, and preexisting mental and physical conditions. This is exactly why thereis potential for incidences of both suicide and aggression in this environment. Ifpeople’s behavior were always predictable, how they might respond to a particularsituation would not be such a concern.
The complexity of intervening on many different levels is demanding for critical care
nurses and the reason why job stress is common. In addition to caring for patients andtheir signiﬁcant others, nurses must cope with high mortality rates, ethical dilemmas,end-of-life decisions, the interdisciplinary team, conﬂicting value disputes, and anenormous workload. It is especially because of this that nurses in this setting must be

particularly attuned to changes in patient behavior that might signal distress. Early
detection and intervention are key in keeping patients safe.
RISK FOR SUICIDE
Whereas psychiatric units are designed (or should be) for suicide prevention, this isnot always the case with other areas in the general hospital. In one study it was foundthat even psychiatric units are not always designed with safety in mind.
5,6Some
environmental risk factors include anchor points for hanging, potentially dangerousmaterials that can be used for self harm, and problems encountered in trying to makeany environment completely safe.
5,6Methods of self-harm that are commonly used in
health care environments include hanging, jumping, cutting with a sharp object, drugoverdose, and strangulation.
5,6There are some speciﬁc means for self-harm in the
general hospital setting that have been used to complete a suicide: bell cords,bandages, tubing, sheets, and restraint belts.
7System constraints create risk as well,
for example, poor assessment, observation, and intervention; insufﬁcient staff train-ing; inadequate stafﬁng; poor communication; and lack of information about suicideprevention and referral sources.

IN-HOSPITAL SUICIDE OUTSIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PSYCHIATRIC UNITS
Patient suicide or attempted suicide resulting in serious disability while a patient isbeing cared for in a health care facility is one of the National Quality Forum’s (NQF)Health Care “never events.” The term “never event” was ﬁrst introduced in 2001 by
Ken Kizer, MD, former CEO of the NQF, in reference to particularly shocking medicalerrors (such as wrong-site surgery) that should never occur.
9The Joint Commission
(TJC) labels in-hospital suicide a sentinel event.10A sentinel event is an unexpected
occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the riskthereof. In 1998, TJC issued a Sentinel Event Alert on preventing inpatient suicideswith a focus on general hospitals and prevention of suicide in medical/surgical arenasand emergency departments.
11This report was updated in 2010.5A goal of the 2010
report was to provide information that would ensure that patients outside of thepsychiatric unit are appropriately screened and cared for. They note in the report that:
While psychiatric setting are designed to be safe for suicidal individuals and have
staff with specialized training, typically, medical /surgical units and emergencydepartments are not designed or assessed for suicide risk and do not have staffthat have specialized training to deal with suicidal individuals. Not surprisingly,suicidal individuals often are admitted to general hospitals immediately follow-ing suicide attempts or they seek help in hospital emergency departments –often at the urging of family or friends – when they are most desperate, thesepatients are known “ at risk” for suicide.
5(p1)
Many patients who kill themselves in general hospital inpatient units within the
general hospital have no psychiatric history or history of previous suicide attempt.
They are not known to be at risk for suicide.7TJC reports that suicide has been
ranked in the top ﬁve most frequently reported sentinel events since 1995. TheSentinel Event Database includes 827 reports of inpatient suicides. Of the 827reports:
•14.25% occurred in the nonbehavioral health units of general hospitals (eg,medical or surgical units, intensive care unit [ICU] oncology, telemetry).
•8.02% occurred in the emergency department of general hospitals.42 Rittenmeyer
•2.45% occurred in other nonpsychiatric settings (eg, home care, critical access
hospitals, long-term care hospitals, and physical rehabilitation hospitals).5
SUICIDE ASSESSMENT
Who Is At Risk?
Physical illness and mental disorders have been recognized as risk factors for
suicide.12Patients who have a physical illness are two to three times more likely to
complete a suicide than those who do not.13,14Annually, approximately 650,000
individuals require emergency room treatment in U.S. medical centers as the result ofattempted suicide.
15Identiﬁed risk factors for suicide are listed in Box 1.
Warning Signs
There are numerous warning signs distinct from the risk factors that are associatedwith the increased feelings of desperation and can represent imminent risk.
5A
summary of these signs is provided in Box 2.
Box 2
Suicidal warning signs
●Irritability ●Refusing medications
●Increased anxiety ●Requesting early discharge
●Agitation ●Meeting the diagnostic criteria for depression

Suicide assessment should become part of nurses’ daily assessment routine.
Accordingly, nurses must keep the suicide risk factors and warning signs in their
conscious mind, as they do other assessment criteria. A clinical story illustratesthis. There was a tragic incident in which a male patient was admitted to anintensive care unit after an uncompleted suicide attempt with carbon monoxide.Even though his admission was the result of a suicide attempt, the staff failed toassess him for his level of suicidality. He had been on unit before and was labeleda “frequent ﬂyer.” He died in the ICU by hanging himself with his belt from theintravenous medication pole. In conducting an autopsy on the circumstances ofthis incident it was found that besides having a previous and recent suicideattempt, he also had a history of 12 of the risk factors listed in Box 1. Ask yourself
the following questions: What could have been done to prevent this? Was itpreventable? What do you think a reasonable and prudent nurse would havedone? How would you have responded?
In addition to being cognizant of the suicide risk factors it is also important to be
cognizant of the warning signs as distinct from the risk factors because some patientswill not have many or any of the risk factors but will display suicide warning signs.Nurses must always keep in mind that given the right circumstances any person’scoping abilities can become overwhelmed. The stages of crisis development providea picture of how this might happen ( Box 3).
More speciﬁcally to this point, in a study that looked at the characteristics of
medical/surgical patients who died by suicide found that:
•There appeared to be an impulsive nature to these suicides.
•Few had known histories of psychiatric illness or suicidal behavior.
•Some were judged—after the fact—to have been agitated while experiencing anundiagnosed depression or delirium at the time of their deaths.
•Some were distraught by an emotional rift.
•Almost none of the deaths involved lengthy planning.
•Most used means readily at their disposal such as stairwells, window curtainrods, and bathroom ﬁxtures.
•Staff sometimes unwittingly provided the instrument of death in the form ofmedical equipment.
7(p245)
INTERVENTION/PREVENTION
The difﬁculty of ensuring patient safety in the critical care arena is due in part to thefact that there are a myriad of different types of patients that need high-dependencycare. Suicide prevention is aimed at the individual needs of the patient. For instance,if the patient is admitted with a psychiatric diagnosis or a suicide attempt one wouldBox 3
Stages of crisis development
●The individual or family is in a state of homeostasis.
●A stressful event or events occur.
●The event is perceived as a threat.
●Well known coping skills are applied but fail to reduce the threat.
●A period of disequilibrium occurs with a decrease of problem-solving ability and increase in
feelings of anxiety and depression.
●The problem is either resolved or personal disintegration occurs.44 Rittenmeyer
look to the patient’s psychiatric history for guidance. This approach might not be
helpful for other types of patients. “Medical/Surgical patients may be less likely thanpsychiatric patients to display traditional risk factor such as substance abuse. Theyare much more likely to have agitation propelled by delirium induced by a medical/surgical condition.”
7(p245)
The Practice Recommendations from the Registered Nurses’ Association of
Ontario (RNAO) assessment and care of adults at risk for suicidal ideation andbehavior clinical guideline provides guidance for assessing and caring for adults atrisk for suicidal ideation and behavior.
16
The guideline has the following objectives:
1. To assist nurses working in diverse practice settings to provide evidence-based
care to adults at risk for suicidal ideation and behaviors
2. To provide nurses with recommendations, based on the best available evidence,
related to the assessment and management of adults at risk for suicidal ideationand behavior
3. To increase nurses’ comfort, conﬁdence, and competence in this practice area, in
order to enhance safety for their clients and to lower the impact of suicide forsociety
4. To provide support to the nurse in her or his care of the suicidal patient
The following evidence-based practice recommendations are meant to support
nurses’ clinical decision making, without implying that they hold more weight thanone’s clinical expertise and judgment in any clinical situation.
16
1. The nurse will take seriously all statements made by the client that indicates,
directly or indirectly, a wish to die by suicide, and all available information thatindicates a risk for suicide.
2. The nurse works toward establishing a therapeutic relationship with clients at risk
for suicidal ideation and behavior.
3. The nurse works with the client to minimize the feelings of shame, guilt, and stigma
that may be associated with suicidality, mental illness, and addiction.
4. The nurse provides care in keeping with the principles of cultural safety/cultural
competence.
5. The nurse assesses and manages factors that may impact the physical safety of
both the client and the interdisciplinary team.
6. The nurse assesses for protective factors associated with suicide prevention.7. The nurse obtains collateral information from all available sources: family/friends/
community support/medical records and medical health professionals.
8. The nurse mobilizes resources based on the client’s assessed level of suicide
risk–associated needs.
9. The nurse ensures that observation and therapeutic engagement reﬂect the
client’s changing suicide risk.
10. The nurse uses a mutual problem-solving approach to facilitate the client’s
understanding of how he or she perceives his or her own problems and generate
solutions.
11. The nurse fosters hope with the suicidal client.12. The nurse is aware of current treatments to provide advocacy, referral, monitor-
ing, and health teaching interventions, as appropriate.
13. The nurse identiﬁes persons affected by suicide that may beneﬁt from resources
and supports and refers as appropriate.45 In-Hospital Suicide and Aggression
14. Nurse may initiate and participate in a debrieﬁng process with other team
members regarding organizational protocol.
15. The nurse seeks support for clinical supervision when working with adults at risk
for suicidal ideation and behavior to become aware of the emotional impact of the
nurse and enhance clinical practice.
16. Nursing curricula should corporate content on mental health issues, including
suicide risk reduction and prevention, in a systematic manner to promote corecompetencies and mental health practice.
17. Health care organizations that admit suicidal clients must provide a safe physical
environment that minimizes access to the means for self-injurious behavior.
18. In health care organizations that admit suicidal patients, nursing staff comple-
ments should be appropriate to the patient/nurse ratio and to the staff mix tosafely meet the unpredictable needs of acutely suicidal patients.
19. Organizations ensure the critical incidents involving suicidal behavior are re-
viewed systematically to identify opportunities for learning at all levels of servicedelivery.
20. Organizations develop policies and structures related to peer debrieﬁng after the
critical incident, such as death by suicide. Policy should be developed to supportstaff and minimize vicarious trauma.
21. Organizations allocate resources to ensure that all nurses have opportunities for
clinical supervision and coaching on an ongoing basis.
22. Organizations implement policies regarding the systematic documentation of
suicide risk assessment.
23. Organizations promote the service available within the organization and commu-
nity may support the care of adults at risk for suicidal ideation and behavior.
24. Organizations support nurses’ opportunities for professional development and
mental health nursing.
25. Organizations support research initiatives related to suicide and other mental
health issues.
26. Organizations develop a plan for the implementation of best practice guidelines
to include an assessment of organizational readiness and barriers to education;involve all members who will contribute to the implementation process; ongoingopportunities for discussion and education to reinforce the importance of bestpractices; dedication of a qualiﬁed individual to provide the facilitation requiredfor the education and implementation process; opportunities for reﬂection onpersonal and organizational experience implementing guidelines; strategies forsustainability; and allocation of adequate resources for implementation andsustainability, including organizational and administrative support.
RISK FOR AGGRESSION
The World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Department of Labor OccupationalSafety and Health Administration (OSHA), National Institute for Occupational Safetyand Health (NIOSH), the American Nurses Association (ANA), the American Associ-ation of Occupational Health Nurses (AAOHN), and the U.S. Department of Justice(DOJ) all consider workplace violence an issue of concern. Although more researchexists pertaining to acts of aggression in psychiatric settings, in reality aggression canoccur in any setting. The DOJ and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are the entitiesthat gather statistical data related to this problem. Data from these two sourcesindicate that health care workers are at increased risk to be victims of workplaceviolence. BLS reports that there were 69 homicides in health services from 1996 to2000, and in 2000, 48% of all nonfatal injuries of occupational assault occurred in46 Rittenmeyer
health  care  and social services.17 A study  (N /H11005 3465)  that looked at incidence of 
violence against nurses  working in U.S. EDs found  25% of participants reported 
experiencing physical violence more than 20 times  in the past 3 years, and almost 
20%  reported experiencing verbal abuse more than  200 times in the same time 
period.18 Workplace violence is an act in which  a person is abused, threatened, 
intimidated, or assaulted in the course of his or her employment.  The acts of 
workplace violence can range from  an angry  verbal attack to physical assault.9
PREVENTION IS KEY
One of the most important things about aggression is to “see it coming.” There may
be some instances when a person will go from “zero to a hundred” in a few secondsbut that is probably rare. The more likely scenario is that there will be multipleopportunities to observe behaviors that signal distress, and early recognition providesopportunity for early intervention. It was established at the beginning of this articlethat high-dependency environments are very stressful and therefore the people inthem are stressed as well.
The Relationship Between Aggression, Anger, and Anxiety
Aggression and anger are closely related. What is more difﬁcult to conceptualize is therelationship between anger and anxiety. Understanding this relationship provides abetter opportunity for early intervention and therefore an opportunity to de-escalatepotential aggressive incidents. The result of feeling anxious is frustration andhelplessness. These feelings in turn cause some individuals to feel powerless tocontrol their own autonomy. Anger is a more powerful feeling than anxiety, particularly
in situations in which the person perceives little control. As anxiety brings feelings ofhelplessness, anger makes people feel better because they feel they have regainedsome control. In other words, for some people, the intolerable feeling of anxiety isreplaced with the more powerful feeling of anger. Although this can be effective as atemporary coping mechanism, it is not very helpful when it is the only copingmechanism that is at a person’s disposal.
19
The open expression of anger is often discouraged and causes others to feel
uncomfortable. Anger is a natural emotion and the rational expression of angryfeelings can be appropriate for some situations. For example, someone misplacingdiagnostic tests of a patient, resulting in the need to repeat the test is probablygrounds for some legitimate anger. In these types of situations the person’s angerneeds to be validated. Nurses are sometimes the recipients of anxious/angry feelingsand it is can be difﬁcult for them not to personalize their response to theseexpressions of emotion with anger of their own. This is particularly true when thefocus of the anger is unwarranted. Of course, responding with anger will only serve toescalate the angry feelings.
19Understanding that increasing anxiety can trigger angry
responses provides an opportunity to intervene to decrease anxiety, which is saferand more productive than intervening in an aggressive incident.
If a nurse is confronted with an angry patient or family member, it is imperative to
address their concerns. It is important to pick up the early signs of anger becauseangry feelings tend to increase if the cause for the anger is not addressed. Earlyintervention to reduce anger and accompanying anxiety increases the probability of apositive outcome. However, if a patient’s expression of anger is not rationale orescalating rapidly, the nurse will need to set clear limits and escalate his or herinterventions.
1947 In-Hospital Suicide and Aggression
ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION
Anger can be conceptualized on a continuum ranging from mild, to moderate, to
severe, to rage. Box 4 illustrates a gradation of anger behaviors.
As indicated earlier, when anxiety or anger is escalating, immediate intervention is
required. Box 5 illustrates interventions.
SYSTEM RESPONSIBILITIES IN REDUCING WORKPLACE VIOLENCE
The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of 1970 mandates that employershave a general duty to provide their employees with a hazard-free workplace. JointCommission Performance Standard EP4 states that hospitals/organizations musthave a code of conduct that deﬁnes acceptable and disruptive and inappropriatebehavior, and performance standard EP 5 states that leaders need to create andimplement a process for managing disruptive and inappropriate behavior. In 2004,OSHA published the Guidelines for Preventing Workplace Violence for Healthcareand Social Service Workers. The goal of this guideline is to eliminate or reduceworker exposure to conditions that lead to death or injury from violence byimplementing effective security devices and administrative work practices, amongother control measures.
20The following are the major recommendations of the
OSHA guideline:
1. Management commitment and employee involvement
Management commitment and employee involvement are complementary and es-
sential elements of an effective safety and health program.
To ensure an effective program, management and frontline employees must work
together, perhaps through a team or committee approach.20Box 4

2. Worksite analysis
A worksite analysis involves a step-by-step, commonsense look at the workplace to
ﬁnd existing or potential hazards for workplace violence. This entails reviewingspeciﬁc procedures or operations that contribute to hazards and speciﬁc areas wherehazards may develop. A threat assessment team, patient assault team, similar taskforce, or coordinator may assess the vulnerability to workplace violence and deter-mine the appropriate preventive actions to be taken. This group may also beresponsible for implementing the workplace violence prevention program. The teamshould include representatives from senior management, operations, employeeassistance, security, occupational safety and health, legal and human resourcesstaff.
20
3. Focus of a worksite analysis
The recommended program for worksite analysis includes, but is not limited to:
/c143Analyzing and tracking records
/c143Screening surveys
/c143Analyzing workplace security.20Box 5
Nursing interventions for a continuum of anger behaviors
Prevention Mild–Moderate Severe to Rage
●Listen when patients talk
to you.●Help the patient verbalize
angry feelings.●Prevent physical harm
to the patient or staff.
●Do not dismiss people’s
concerns.●Validate the patient’s anger. ●Help the patient
identify the source of
anger.
●Treat each patient as an
individual.●Avoid defensive responses. ●Support the patient in
attempts to controlanger.
●Talk to patients, not at
them.●Use therapeutic
communication skills.●Implement a violence
code if necessary.
●Respect patients’ privacy. ●Assist the patient to identify
the source of anger.
●Don’t make rules that
treat adults as children.●Allow the patient an outlet
for angry feelings.
●Recognize when patients
are feeling anxious andintervene to reduce theanxiety.●Engage in mutual problem
solving.
●Allow the patient more
control over health caredecisions.
●Limit exposure to
frustrating situations.
●Teach the patient relaxation
techniques such as deepbreathing.
●Continually monitor for
possible escalation to ahigher level.49 In-Hospital Suicide and Aggression
4. Hazard prevention and control
After hazards are identiﬁed through the systematic worksite analysis, the next step is
to design measures through engineering or administrative and work practices toprevent or control these hazards. If violence does occur, post-incident response canbe an important tool in preventing future incidents.
20
5. Safety and health training
Training and education ensure that all staff are aware of potential security hazards andhow to protect themselves and their coworkers through established policies andprocedures.
20
6. Elements of a program evaluation
As part of their overall program, employers should evaluate their safety and securitymeasures. Top management should review the program regularly, and with eachincident, to evaluate its success. Responsible parties (including managers, supervi-sors, and employees) should reevaluate policies and procedures on a regular basis toidentify deﬁciencies and take corrective action. More in-depth guidance may be foundatwww.OSHA.gov/.
SUMMARY
High-dependency environments are complex both from the standpoint of diversity ofpatient types and the nature of their functioning. Nurses manage this complexity atmany different levels. Being attuned not only to the physical status of the patient butalso the emotional/psychological status is paramount in maintaining a safe environ-ment. Staff training and education is paramount in reducing risk. Institutions have aresponsibility to provide resources to develop violence prevention programs.

1Suicide and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury
Lift up your hearts and remember me,
God wants me now, he set me free.
  —From a suicide note
Suicide is devastating for those who lose a family member or 
friend; for those who contemplate suicide, the feelings are pow-
erful and overwhelming. Approximately every 14 minutes, a 
human life ends as the result of suicide, leading to the loss 
of approximately 105 American lives daily (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). Pain and hopelessness Don’t gri eve for me, for now I’m free,
I’m following the path that God laid for me.
I took his hand when I heard him call,
I turned away, and left it all.
Tasks le ft undone must stay that way,
I’ve found true peace at the close of day.
If parting now has left a void,
Then ﬁll it with remembered joy.

Suicide  and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury 2
 
 
 In a study on war veterans, the rate of signiﬁcant depressive 
symptoms was 31% higher than that of the general population. 
According to the Department of Defense, completed suicides of 
military personnel between 2005 and 2009 accounted for more 
than 1100 deaths, an average of 1 suicide every 36 hours 
during the 5-year period (Cassels, 2010). More recent statistics 
reveal that active-duty military personnel complete suicide at the 
rate of 1 per day, and when veterans are included in the count, the 
rate is 1 suicide every 80 minutes (Gibbs & Thompson, 2012). 
 B o x  2 5 - 1      provides some facts about suicide, including data for 
speciﬁc age groups.
Risk Factors
   Suicidal ideation  is the manifestation of inner pain, hopelessness, 
and helplessness suffered by individuals. Psychiatric disorders 
accompany 90% of  completed suicides   ( Brendel  et al., 2008,  Na -
tional Institute of Mental Health , 2012). The percentage of com -
pleted suicides attributable to speciﬁc psychiatric disorders is 
listed in  Table 25-1   .
It is estimated that two thirds of those who complete sui -
cide are experiencing depression at the time. About 15% of 
patients who have major depression or bipolar disorder (dur -
ing the depressed phase) will complete suicide ( Brendel et al., 
2008). Loss of relationships, ﬁnancial difﬁculty, and impul -
sivity are factors in this population.
Suicide is more than 50 times higher among patients with 
schizophrenia than in the general population, especially during 
the ﬁrst few years of the illness ( Limosin  et al., 2007). 
It is the leading cause of early death in this population. About 
40% of all patients with schizophrenia attempt suicide at least 
once; males have a rate of 60%. Up to 10% of these patients die 
from suicide, usually related to depressive symptoms rather 
than to command hallucinations or delusions.
Patients with alcohol or substance use disorders also have a 
higher suicide risk. Y ears of abuse and comorbidity with de -
pression or antisocial personality disorder are also factors as -
sociated with increased risk. Up to 15% of alcohol/substance 
abusers complete suicide ( Sadock  & Sadock, 2008). Studies 
have indicated that 50% of the individuals who end their life by 
suicide have alcohol in their blood at the time of death. Alcohol, 
a depressant, tends to dull one’s senses, and individuals who are 
otherwise ambivalent about whether to end their lives may act 
on suicidal thoughts.
Suicide is usually accompanied by intensely conﬂicted feel -
ings of pain, hopelessness, guilt, and self-loathing, coupled 
with the belief that there are no solutions and that that things 
will not improve. However, the hope of appropriate treatment 
to relieve patients' suicidal symptoms does exist, and health 
care providers are important in communicating this hope with 
patients.
  P e o p l e  w h o  s u r v i v e  s e r i o u s   suicide attempts  often report that 
it is these feelings that fuel the sense of isolation and despair. 
They describe an all-consuming psychic pain that shuts out 
thoughts of the loved ones and heartache they will leave behind.

hand on a hot stove burner. At that moment, you are 
unlikely to think of anything but putting an immediate end to too frequently culminate in a suicide attempt or completed 
suicide.
Suicide is largely preventable; yet too often, efforts are only 
directed toward individuals who are at immediate risk. In the 
month prior to their deaths, 45% of suicide completers had 
contact with their primary care provider as compared to 20% 
who were in contact with mental health providers ( Schreiber , 
Culpepper, & Fife, 2011). It is critical for health care providers 
to be advocates for this problem and to mobilize the com -
munity in reducing and preventing factors that may contribute 
to suicide. This course  reviews the facts about suicide, discusses 
assessment and care of patients who may be suicidal, and ad -
dresses the needs of families of these patients. A second, related 
category of behavior disturbance, non-suicidal self-injury, is 
addressed in a separate section at the end of the c ourse.
  CLINICAL PICTURE
   Suicide   is the intentional act of killing oneself by any means. 
A history of suicide attempts puts a person at a high probability of 
actually completing the suicide in the future, particularly in the 
24 months following the attempt.  Nock   and colleagues (2010) 
note that while these suicide behaviors are most often associated 
with other psychiatric disorders, especially major depression, 
suicidal behaviors share similar pathological features and require 
similar treatment plans no matter what other disorder is present.
Suicidal intent and behaviors are symptoms that are mani -
fested in association with mood disorders and psychotic disor -
ders. Clinical attention is directed to individuals who exhibit 
these behaviors because of the serious outcomes that may 
result.
  EPIDEMIOLOGY
In the United States, suicide is the tenth-leading cause of 
death—38,364 people ended their lives by suicide in 2011 (CDC, 
National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2012). Suicide 
is the fourth-leading cause of death among children ages 10 to 14, 
the third-leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year-olds, the 
fourth-leading cause of death among persons ages to 44, and the 
eighth-leading cause of death among 45- to 64-year-olds (Centers 
for Disease Control, 2012).
Attempted suicide or suicidal ideation led to 666,000 annual 
visits to the emergency room, and outcomes may be catastrophic 
for the individual. Consider the young man with schizophrenia 
who is so depressed and confused from his illness that he takes 
an overdose and kneels down in front of his couch to pray for 
forgiveness as he dies. His father ﬁnds him lifeless. The young 
man lives, but since he was in a kneeling position for so long, the 
circulation to his legs was compromised. This necessitated their 
amputation and led to lifelong physical disability.
It is important to consider that the number of suicides may 
actually be double or triple those reported due to underreport -
ing in general. Purposefully aiming the car at a bridge abutment 
and crashing may look like an accident; however, many reported 
accidents, homicides, and deaths ruled as “undetermined” are 
actually suicides.

the pain. Emotional pain often renders the individual void of 
thought and without enough motivation to leave a suicide note. 
Only about 33% of individuals who complete suicide leave a 
note ( Haines   et al., 2011).
Besides psychiatric disorders, other risk factors for suicide 
include the following ( Sadock   & Sadock, 2008):
       Male gender:  Men commit suicide four times more often
than women.
         Increasing age:   For men, suicide rates peak after the age of
45; for women, rates peak after 55. 
          Race:   White males commit two out of every three suicides in
the United States.
         Religion:  Religiosity is associated with decreased rates of
suicide. Protestants and Jews have higher rates of suicide
than Roman Catholics.
         Marriage:   Being married, especially with children in the
home, signiﬁcantly reduces the risk of suicide. Divorced men
are more likely than divorced women to kill themselves.
         Profession:   Professionals are generally considered at higher
risk for suicide, particularly if there is a fall in status. Law
enforcement personnel, dentists, artists, mechanics, insur -
ance agents, and lawyers are also at higher risk.
         Physical health:  About half of those who complete suicide
have physical illnesses. Loss of mobility, disﬁgurement, and
chronic pain are especially associated with suicide.
Since individuals with suicidal ideation are often ambivalent
about death, helping them examine alternative actions to re-
duce their pain is critical. Extensive data are available about risk 
factors for suicide, based on epidemiological studies and  psy-
chological autopsies   (i.e., retrospective reviews of the deceased 
person’s life within several months of death to establish likely 
diagnoses at the time of death). There is also evidence concern-
ing protective factors (those that tend to reduce risk). Refer to 
 B o x  2 5 - 2       for a description of signiﬁcant psychosocial risk and 
protective factors for suicide. General
   Suicide is the tenth-leading cause of death for all ages.
   More than 34,000 suicides occur annually in the U.S. This is the
equivalent of 105 suicides per day or 1 suicide every 14 minutes.
   The National Violent Death Reporting System examined toxicology
tests of those who committed suicide in 16 states; 33.3% tested
positive for alcohol and 21% for opiates or prescription painkillers.
Gender Statistics
   Males take their own lives at nearly four times the rate of
females and represent 79.8% of all U.S. suicides.
   During their lifetime, women attempt suicide about two to
three times more often than men.
   Suicide is the seventh-leading cause of death for males and the
ﬁfteenth-leading cause for females.
   Among males, adults aged 75 years and older have the highest
rate of suicide (nearly 36.1 per 100,000 population).
   Among females, those in their 40s and 50s have the highest
rate of suicide (8.8 per 100,000 population).
   Firearms are the most commonly used method of suicide
among males (approximately 56.7%).
   Poisoning is the most common method of suicide for fe -
males (37%).
Racial and Ethnic Statistics
   Among American Indians/Alaska Natives ages 15 to 34 years,
suicide is the second-leading cause of death.    Suicide rates among American Indian/Alaskan Native adoles-
cents and y oung adults ages 15 to 34 (31 per 100,000) are
2.5 times higher than the national average for that age group
(12 per 100,000).
   Of female students in grades 9 to 12, signiﬁcantly more His-
panic (13.5%) attempt suicide than black non-Hispanics (9%)
and white non-Hispanics (8%).
Age Statistics
   In 2011, 16% of U.S. high school students reported that
they had seriously considered attempting suicide during the 
12 months preceding the survey. About 8% of students re -
ported that they had actually attempted suicide one or more 
times during the same period.
   Suicide is the third-leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year-
olds, accounting f or 20% of all deaths annually.
   Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among 25- to
34-year-olds.
   The rate of suicide for adults ages 75 years and older was 16
per 100,000.
Attempted Suicide
   In 2011, nearly 500,000 people were treated in emergency de-
partments for self-inﬂicted injuries.
   There is 1 suicide for every 25 attempted suicides.

Problem
Conducting assessments for the relative risk of suicide that are 
both sensitive and accurate is challenging. After suicide attempts, 
the assessment, management, and treatment of patients who 
survive is a challenging task for clinicians.
  Purpose of Study
The purpose of the study was to evaluate tools for suicide risk 
assessment that summarize the risk factors, warning signs, and 
protective factors; benchmark the risk; and suggest targeted 
interventions when the outcome of the assessment is height-
ened risk. 
  Methods
The researcher reviewed the risk and protective factors known 
from the literature to have the strongest evidence base. 
The researcher also reviewed recent recommendations in the 
literature for clinicians to enhance therapeutic alliances with 
patients and to consider recent situations that contributed to the 
patient’s suicidal ideation.
   Key Findings
Risk factors associated with suicide attempts include the following:
   Past suicide attempts remain the strongest consistent predictor
of suicide attempts and completed suicide.
   Comorbid psychiatric diagnosis is a greater risk with substance,
mood, and personality disorders.
   Single diagnoses of eating disorders and substance abuse
disorders have the greatest risk.    Severity of mental disorder, regardless of the disorder, may be
a risk factor.
   Psychological vulnerabilities, including aggressiveness/impulsivity,
anxiety, and depressive symptoms, increase the risk.
   Genetic markers; 5-HTT serotonin-gene is a moderate risk
factor.
   Demographic factors convey risk, albeit inconsistently. At higher
risk are males (who complete more suicides), persons who are
unmarried, the elderly, adolescent and young adult age groups,
and Caucasian race.
   Diathesis-stress models may confer greater risk where underly -
ing genetic and psychological vulnerabilities may be triggered
by environmental stressors.

CONSIDERING CULTURE
Suicide and Sexual Identity
   Suicide among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth is on 
the rise in the United States. In the 15- to 24-year-old population, 
suicide is the third-leading cause of death, and LGB youth 
are more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual 
peers (CDC, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 
2011). Hatzenbuehler (2012) utilized the Oregon Healthy Teens 
survey to study youth in the 11 th  grade between 2006 and 2008. 
Of the 33,714 students who participated in the study, about 
90% identiﬁed themselves as heterosexual, about 1% identiﬁed 
themselves as gay or lesbian, about 3% identiﬁed themselves 
as bisexual, about 2% reported they were not sure about their 
sexual identity, and 4% did not respond. Of those students who 
reported their sexual identity, nearly 20% of lesbian and gay 
youth, and 22% of bisexual youth reported having attempted 
suicide as compared to only 4% of the heterosexual youth.
In all instances, self-identiﬁed lesbian or gay and self-identiﬁed 
bisexual youth reported signiﬁcantly higher percentages of the 
suicide risk factors than their heterosexual peers. The study also 
suggests that an environment that is supportive of LGB results 
in fewer suicide attempts. A supportive environment includes a 
higher number of same-sex couples, registered Democrats, the 
presence of gay-straight alliances in schools, and school policies 
that protect LGB from discrimination and bullying.
From Hatzenbeuhler, M. (2011). The social environment and suicide 
attempts in lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth.  Pediatrics,   127,  896–903.    The assessment tool that encompasses both risk and protective 
factors, provides the clinician with a tool to benchmark risk, and 
suggests interventions when the outcome is heightened risk is the 
Suicide Assessment Five-step Evaluation and Triage (SAFE-T). 
This tool was established based on sponsored research out-
comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration and the recommendations of the  American 
Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines (2003). Students are 
encouraged to download a free pocket guide may be down-
loaded from    http://store.samhsa.gov/product/SMA09-4432   . The 
tool allows the clinician to benchmark relative risk (high, mod -
erate, low) and to develop a treatment plan, in consultation 
with the patient, to reduce current risk.
Implications for Nursing Practice

both inpatient and outpatient settings. Assessment of risk factors, 
warning signs, and protective factors is an ongoing responsibility, 
as is establishing therapeutic alliances with patients. Nurses are in 
a unique position to establish therapeutic alliances with patients 
while communicating care and concern. Use of the SAFE-T risk 
assessment will provide valuable information for development of 
a plan of care to keep the patient safe.
   ETIOLOGY
 
 Biological Factors
 S u i c i d a l  b e h a v i o r  i s  o f t e n  p r e v a l e n t  a m o n g  f a m i l y  m e m b e r s .  
Margaux Hemingway’s death in 1996 was the fifth suicide 
among four generations of writer Ernest Hemingway’s 
(1899-1961) family. Twin and adoption studies suggest the 
presence of genetic factors in suicide. Suicide rates in twins 
are higher among monozygotic (identical) twins than among 
dizygotic (fraternal) twins. Studies found a significantly 
higher incidence of suicide among biological relatives of 
adoptees who completed suicide than among the biological 
relatives of control subjects. With the identification of the 
human genome, the number of studies examining both pro -
tective and risk genetic variants is increasing is number.
Murphy et al. (2011) obtained blood samples for DNA 
from 159 patients with diagnosed mental disorders (76 suicide 
attempters and 83 non-attempters). They examined the contri-
bution of individual genetic variants to the prediction of sui-
cide attempters and whether single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) have potential for gene-gene and gene-environmental 
interactions. The researchers identiﬁed four SNPs that were 
positively associated with suicide attempters when compared 
to the non-attempter group. Further studies examining the 
complex relationship of genetic and environmental factors in 
the suicidal behavior of individuals with mental disorders have 
promise to provide insight into treatment strategies.

have found low levels of serotonin or its metabolites in the 
cerebrospinal ﬂuid of patients who are suicidal ( Brendel   et al., 
2008). Postmortem exams of individuals who complete suicide 
also reveal a low level of serotonin in the brainstem or the 
frontal cortex.  Psychosocial Factors
Sigmund Freud originally theorized that suicide resulted from 
unacceptable aggression toward another person that is turned 
inward. Karl Menninger added to Freud’s thought by describing 
three parts of suicidal hostility: the wish to kill, the wish to be 
killed, and the wish to die ( Sadock  & Sadock, 2008). Aaron Beck 
identiﬁed a central emotional factor underlying suicide intent: 
hopelessness. Cognitive styles that contribute to higher risk are 
rigid all-or-nothing thinking, inability to see different options, 
and perfectionism (APA, 2003).

nation of suicidal fantasies accompanied by loss (love, self-
esteem, job, and freedom due to imminent incarceration), rage 
or guilt, and identiﬁcation with an individual who completed 
suicide (copycat suicide). A  copycat suicide   follows a highly pub-
licized suicide of a public ﬁgure, an idol, or a peer in the com-
munity. Adolescents are at especially high risk, due to their 
immature prefrontal cortex, the portion of the brain that con-
trols the executive functions involving judgment, frustration 
tolerance, and impulse control.
  Cultural Factors
Cultural factors, including religious beliefs, family values, sexual 
orientation ( see the Considering Culture box ), and attitude to-
ward death, have an impact on suicide rates. In 2009, ethnicity 
was a signiﬁcant factor in the number of deaths by suicide in the 
United States. White, non-Hispanics had the highest number of 
deaths by suicide, about 14 per 100,000. Other groups with high 
rates of suicide are American Indians and Alaskan Natives, about 
Suicide  and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury 6
12 per 100,000, and Asian or Paciﬁc Islanders, about 6 per 
100,000 (Centers for Disease Control, 2012).
   Among African Americans, men complete suicide more 
often than women, and the peak rate occurs in adolescence 
and young adulthood. Protective factors for this group as a 
whole include religion and the role of the extended family, 
both of which provide a strong social support system. Simi-
larly, among Hispanic Americans, Roman Catholic religion 
(in which suicide is a sin) and the importance given to the 
extended family decrease the risk for suicide. There is also the 
philosophy of  fatalismo , a belief that divine providence regu -
lates the world; the individual is deemed unable to control 
adverse events and is more likely to accept misfortune instead 
of blaming the self.
Among Asian Americans, suicide rates are noted to in -
crease with age. Beliefs that reduce suicide attempts include 
the adherence to religions that emphasize interdependence 
between the individual and society (i.e., self-destruction is 
seen as disrespectful to the group or selﬁsh). The high value 
given to the reputation of the family, however, may lead to 
the conclusion that suicide is preferable if it prevents shame 
to the family. A belief in reincarnation may make death a 
potentially honorable solution to life problems.
Suicide bombing has grown exponentially in recent years, 
most recently in the Middle East. While not condoned by Islam, 
suicide bombers may believe that it is an honor to die in defense 
of their faith, that real happiness exists beyond this life, and 
that for martyrs, dying is not real death but an honorable ticket 
straight to heaven. However, there is debate in the literature 
regarding the difference between martyrdom and suicide. 
Further research will bring clarity to how mental health profes -
sionals might indeed prevent suicide for those who clearly have 
personal suicidal intent versus those who choose to conduct 
suicide bombings for martyrdom’s purpose.
  Societal Factors
   A s s i s t e d  s u i c i d e ,  a s  a  s o c i e t a l  f a c t o r ,  i s  b o t h  a  m o r a l  a n d  e t h i c a l  
issue. In the United States, Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act of 
1994 allowed terminally ill patients to legally seek a physician-
assisted suicide. The patient must be thoroughly screened by 
a physician and deemed to be both terminally ill and psychiatri-
cally sound; however, concern has been raised that as many as 
25% of the patients in Oregon who were assisted to die actually 
have clinical depression ( Ganzini   & Dobscha, 2008).
  I n  2 0 0 9 ,  W a s h i n g t o n  s t a t e  a l s o  a p p r o v e d  l e g i s l a t i o n  a l l o w i n g  
physicians to prescribe lethal medication. Montana’s Supreme 
Court determined that assisted suicide is a medical treatment 
( Marker   & Hamlon, 2010). The Netherlands allows for this 
practice in nonterminal cases of “lasting and unbearable” suf-
fering ( Appel , 2007). Belgium authorizes physician-assisted 
suicide for nonterminal cases when suffering is deemed to be 
“constant and cannot be alleviated.” Switzerland, where assisted 
suicide has been legal since 1918, has the most liberal laws; it 
allows nonresidents to terminate their lives without a physician 
involved in the process ( Appel , 2007).
The ethical and moral dilemmas in this evolving trend 
are clear. There are now debates about whether chronic and serious mental illness is no different in the depth and breadth 
of suffering than chronic and serious physical illness. Until 
more effective treatment or a cure is found, some individuals 
who obtain little or no beneﬁt from existing psychiatric 
treatments may choose to end suffering through suicide. As 
such, individuals do have the power to end their lives by 
suicide; however, suicide is an all too often tragic, individual 
act. Assisted suicide, on the other hand, is not a private 
act, rather one person facilitating the death of another. 
The ethical dilemma over assisted suicide will continue as 
individuals attempt to determine the deﬁnition of “terminal 
illness” as a reason to support assisted suicide ( Marker   & 
Hamlon, 2010).
APPLICATION OF THE NURSING PROCESS
The process of suicide risk assessment is comprehensive and 
based on identifying speciﬁc risk and protective factors, taking 
a psychosocial and health history, and establishing a therapeutic 
alliance with the patient during the interview. The nurse usually 
completes this assessment in conjunction with other clinicians 
since comparison of data from two interviewers is often a 
signiﬁcant element of the evaluation.
  ASSESSMENT
    Verbal and Nonverbal Clues
Individuals considering suicide generally provide some indica -
tion of their thoughts, especially to people whom they perceive 
to be supportive of them. Nurses often ﬁt into this category. 
There may be overt or covert verbal clues and nonverbal signals. 
Examples include the following:
   O v e r t  S t a t e m e n t s  
      “ I  c a n ’ t  t a k e  i t  a n y m o r e . ”
        “ L i f e  i s n ’ t  w o r t h  l i v i n g  a n y m o r e . ”
        “ I  w i s h  I  w e r e  d e a d . ”
    “Everyone would be better off if I died.”
Covert Statements 
    “It’s okay now. Soon everything will be ﬁne.”
        “ T h i n g s  w i l l  n e v e r  w o r k  o u t . ”
        “ I  w o n ’ t  b e  a  p r o b l e m  m u c h  l o n g e r . ”
    “ N o t h i n g  f e e l s  g o o d  t o  m e  a n y m o r e  a n d  p r o b a b l y  n e v e r  w i l l . ”
    “How can I give my body to medical science?”
Most often it is a relief for people contemplating suicide
to ﬁnally talk to someone about their despair and loneliness. 
Asking about suicidal thoughts does not “give a person ideas” 
and is, in fact, a professional responsibility similar to asking 
about chest pain in cardiac conditions. Talking openly leads 
to a decrease in isolation and can increase problem-solving 
alternatives for living. People who contemplate suicide, attempt 
suicide, and even those who regret the failure of their attempt, 
are often extremely receptive to talking about their suicide 
crisis. Speciﬁc questions to ask about suicidal ideation include 
the following (APA, 2003):
    Have you ever felt that life was not worth living?
        H a v e  y o u  b e e n  t h i n k i n g  a b o u t  d e a t h  r e c e n t l y ?
        D i d  y o u  e v e r  t h i n k  a b o u t  s u i c i d e ?
Trauma  Interventions 7
 
         H a v e  y o u  e v e r  a t t e m p t e d  s u i c i d e ?
    Do you have a plan for completing suicide?
    If so, what is your plan for suicide?
The following dialogue illustrates how the nurse can make
covert messages more open:
   N u r s e :   Y ou haven’t eaten or slept well for the past few days, 
Mary.
   M a r y :   No, I feel pretty low lately.
   N u r s e :   How low are you feeling?
   M a r y :   Oh, I don’t know. Nothing seems to matter to me 
anymore. It’s all so meaningless . . . .
   N u r s e :   T ell me about it, Mary. I want to understand how 
you’re feeling. What is meaningless?
   M a r y :   Life . . . the whole thing . . . nothingness. Life is a 
bad joke.
   N u r s e :   Are you saying you don’t think life is worth living?
   M a r y :   Well . . . yes. It’s all so hopeless anyway.
   N u r s e :   Are you thinking of killing yourself?
   M a r y :   Oh, I don’t know. Well, sometimes I think about it. 
I probably would never go through with it.
   N u r s e :   Mary, let’s talk more about what you’re thinking and 
feeling. This is important. I’ll need to share your thoughts with 
other members of the staff.
The nurse should be alert for nonverbal behavioral clues, 
including showing a sudden brightening of mood with 
more energy (especially after recently being prescribed 
an antidepressant medication), giving away possessions, or 
organizing ﬁnancial affairs. Individuals may be at greater risk 
as their mood lifts and they have enough energy to act 
on their feelings of ambivalence regarding suicide. The risk 
of suicide is highest in the ﬁrst year after a suicide attempt 
( Simon , 2011).
Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines emphasize the 
importance of establishing a therapeutic relationship with the 
patient and asking directly about suicidal feelings (APA, 2003). 
This is the single most important assessment (and interven-
tion), yet health care professionals report a surprisingly small 
amount of probing. Possible reasons for this lack of probing 
include lack of personal comfort, lack of professional conﬁ-
dence, and time constraints. Crisis intervention techniques 
involve listening for the emotional feeling message underlying 
the verbal message, especially when the patient presents as an-
gry, hostile, and overwhelmed. The therapeutic alliance estab -
lished with a patient is a dynamic, changeable interaction that 
may change between interactions. Thus, it must be constantly 
assessed and documented. The presence of the therapeutic alli-
ance may be a protective factor, while the absence of a therapeu-
tic alliance may be a risk factor for suicide ( Simon , 2011).
Lethality of Suicide Plan
The evaluation of a suicide plan is extremely important in 
determining the degree of suicidal risk. Three main elements 
must be considered when evaluating lethality: (1) Is there a 
speciﬁc plan with details? (2) How lethal is the proposed 
method? (3) Is there access to the planned method? People 
who have deﬁnite plans for the time, place, and means are at 
high risk. TABLE 25-2      SAD PERSONS SCALE

Psychosomatics ,  24 (4), 343–349.Based on the  lethality   of a method, which indicates how 
quickly a person would die by that mode, a method can be 
classiﬁed as higher or lower risk. Higher-risk methods, also 
referred to as  hard methods , include:
      U s i n g  a  g u n
        J u m p i n g  o f f  a  h i g h  p l a c e
        H a n g i n g

        S t a g i n g  a  c a r  c r a s h
Examples of lower-risk methods, also referred to as  soft
methods , include:
      S l a s h i n g  o n e ’ s  w r i s t s
        I n h a l i n g  n a t u r a l  g a s
        I n g e s t i n g  p i l l s
When the proposed method is available, the situation is
more serious. A man who has access to a high building and 
states that he will jump from it or a woman who has a gun and 
says that she will shoot herself is at serious risk for suicide. 
When people are experiencing psychotic episodes, they are 
at high risk—regardless of the speciﬁcity of details—because 
impulse control and judgment are grossly impaired. A person 
suffering psychosis is particularly vulnerable when depressed or 
having command hallucinations.
  Assessment Tools
Many tools have been developed to aid a health care worker 
in assessing suicidal potential.  Patterson , Dohn, Bird, and 
Patterson (1983) devised an assessment aid with the acronym 
SAD PERSONS  to evaluate 10 major risk factors for suicide 
( T able 25-2   ). The  SAD PERSONS scale   is a simple and practical 
Suicide  and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury 8
guide for triaging patients who are potentially suicidal, particu-
larly in an emergency department environment. T en categories 
are described in the assessment tool, and the person being 
evaluated is assigned 1 point for each applicable characteristic. 
The total point score for the individual correlates with an action 
scale assisting health care workers in determining whether hos-
pital admission is advisable. If a patient scores in the 3- to 
4-point ranges, it is then necessary for a psychiatric/mental 
health professional to conduct a full mental status examination 
and interview.
The SAD PERSONS tool does not address whether or not 
the individual is taking either illicit or prescribed drugs that 
may have a signiﬁcant impact on the patient. Although the tool 
is dated (1983), it remains a quick assessment of risk factors to 
determine need for further evaluation.
Prescription medications such as antidepressants should be 
evaluated for their contribution to suicide risk. The U.S. Federal 
Drug Administration (FDA) (2007) black box warning for all 
classes of antidepressants includes children and young adults 
between 18 and 24 years old. It states that careful monitoring 
should occur during the ﬁrst few weeks of treatment as well as 
when the dosage is changed. The use of selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with depression related 
to undiagnosed bipolar disorder may result in mania, which 
carries an especially high risk for suicide. This type of mania 
can also be the result of steroid use.
  Self-Assessment
Health care professionals working with individuals who are 
suicidal need collaboration with other clinicians. Fear, grief, 
anger, puzzlement, and condemnation of suicidal feelings/
intent are common. If these intense emotional responses are 
not acknowledged, countertransference may limit effective 
intervention. Understanding the patient with suicidal behavior 
disorder, as well as acknowledging, understanding, and accept-
ing the emotions that arise from working with and caring for 
these patients, is essential.
   ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES
Suicide
1.    Assess risk factors, including history of suicide (in family,
friends), degree of hopelessness and helplessness, and
lethality of plan.
2.    Assess protective factors that may be built upon.
3.    If there is a history of suicide attempt, assess intent, lethality,
and injury.
4.    Determine whether the patient’s age, medical condition,
psychiatric diagnosis, or current medications put the patient
at higher risk.
5.    A change from sad or depressed to happy and peaceful may be
a red ﬂag. Often a decision to commit suicide gives a feeling of
relief and calm.
6.    If the patient is to be managed on an outpatient basis, also
assess social supports and helpfulness of signiﬁcant others.      DIAGNOSIS
The nursing diagnosis with the highest priority is  Risk for suicide . 
Feelings of hopelessness, anger, frustration, abandonment, and 
rejection are common among people who are suicidal. Nursing 
diagnoses that address problems related to depressed mood, 
anxiety, mania, or disturbed thought include  Self-care deﬁcit, 
Sleep pattern disturbance, Altered nutrition, and  Anxiety .

  R e l e v a n t   Nursing Outcomes Classiﬁcation (NOC)  outcomes

protective factors. When there is a comorbid psychiatric disorder, 
the treatment plan includes appropriate nursing approaches (e.g., 
care for patients with depression or schizophrenia). The patient’s 
signiﬁcant others need to be involved because the patient’s percep-
tion of isolation is a signiﬁcant cause of hopelessness.  Case Study 
and Nursing Care Plan 25-1  represents the case of a young woman 
with suicidal ideation treated in an outpatient setting.
     IMPLEMENTATION
 
 Nursing interventions for patients with suicidal ideation and 
suicide attempts take place at three different levels: primary, 
secondary, and tertiary. Improving  overall  community mental 
health may reduce the incidence of suicide more effectively 
than extensive efforts directed at identifying individuals who 
are imminently suicidal; therefore, more attention focused 
on primary interventions that involve community-wide par -
ticipation will lead to improved outcomes.
Primary Intervention
   Primary intervention   includes activities that provide support, infor -
mation, and education to prevent suicide ( Box 25-3  ). Primary in -
tervention is practiced in a wide variety of community settings such 
as schools, homes, churches, clinics, hospitals, and work settings. 
Elementary school children are screened using evidence-based tools 
that focus on both risk factors and warning signs ( Joe  & Bryant, 
2007). Some high schools are adopting suicide prevention curricula 
that involve elements of education, peer support and referral, dis -
cussions about risk and prevention factors, and warning signs 
( Ciffone , 2007,  American Association of Suicidology , 2008).
A suicide prevention model where nurses may be educated 
as gatekeepers as well as be involved in educating the commu -
nity is the Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) model ( Quinnett , 
2007). This model, originally developed in1995, is a simple 
educational “train the trainer” program that provides ordinary

    Kaitlin is a 23-year-old single waitress who is brought to the emergency depart -
ment by ambulance after a suicide attempt. Her live-in boyfriend had narrowly 
prevented her from fatally shooting herself with a gun kept in their apartment. 
She has a minor scalp wound and remains under observation for a few hours 
after treatment. The psychiatric nurse and psychiatrist on call then interview her. 
She states that she has been under increasing stress for the past 2 months 
since entering a management-training program at work. Kaitlin ultimately 
failed at this venture and lost her job. She expresses a great deal of despera -
tion owing to the accumulation of several bills and the upcoming Christmas 
holidays. She admits to keeping these feelings to herself and self-medicating 
her growing fear and anxiety with drugs and alcohol. She states that she feels 
“like a total loser.”

reluctance to open up and share her feelings with anyone, and because her scor -
ing a 4 on the SAD PERSONS scale, the decision is made to hospitalize her. After 
careful assessment, Kaitlin is placed on antidepressant therapy and carefully 
monitored. Additionally, problems relating to her depressive state are assessed 
and monitored (poor appetite, insomnia, self-care deﬁ  cit, and anxiety). After 
3 days on suicide precautions, she is no longer acutely suicidal and agrees to 
continue treatment in the outpatient division of the hospital.

She remembers Kaitlin from the emergency evaluation and expresses reluctance 
to take the assignment. She seeks out the clinical supervisor to discuss the case. 
In talking about her feelings, she realizes that she wants to avoid this patient for 
two reasons. The ﬁrst is that Kaitlin’s impatience, agitation, and anger cause 
Mrs. Ruiz to feel anxious and inadequate. The second is that Mrs. Ruiz disap -
proves of Kaitlin’s attempt to end her life. “She is so young and has her whole 
life in front of her. How bad can her problems be? My Catholic faith makes sui -
cide difﬁcult to accept.”
Mrs. Ruiz also notes the countertransference involved, in that Kaitlin reminds 
her of her own daughter. Mrs. Ruiz recognizes her own feelings and can now 
better focus on Kaitlin’s issues. Kaitlin feels angry and helpless after losing her 
job and facing ﬁ  nancial concerns; her isolation seems self-imposed because she 
pushes people away and keeps her feelings to herself, probably because of low 
self-esteem. After consultation, Mrs. Ruiz agrees with her supervisor that she 
can work with Kaitlin.

Suicide  and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury 12
HEALTH POLICY
Preventing Teen Suicide
A study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health indicated 
that youth are attempting suicide at increasingly younger ages. 
Mazza , Catalono, Abbott, and Haggerty (2011) investigated 883 
youth, aged 18 or 19, who had previously attempted suicide and 
found that 40% reported their ﬁrst suicide attempt was before 
they entered high school. The earliest reported attempt was 
third or fourth grade with a peak being in eighth or ninth grade.
After the death of his 22-year-old son by suicide, Senator Gor-
don Smith introduced a bill that promoted the development of 
effective strategies and best practices to prevent youth suicide. 
The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act was passed, and President 
George W. Bush signed the bill into law in 2004.
Senator Jack Reed sponsored legislation in 2011 to increase 
suicide prevention programs in communities and on college cam -
puses across the country. The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act 
Reauthorization of 2011 (Senate Bill 740) promotes continued 
development of effective strategies and best practices to prevent 
youth suicide. Since then, other senators and representatives 
have championed the reauthorization of the bill to provide much-
needed funding to prevent youth suicide.
Reauthorization of the bill is required to continue funding, and 
challenges related to balancing the federal budget put this bill at 
risk. Proponents of the bill cite statistics regarding increasing 
suicide at younger ages in American. The fate of reauthorization 
bills in each Congressional session is dependent on advocacy 
efforts by nurses and proponents of suicide prevention.

 psychobiological interventions to provide care to patients who 
have suicidal ideation. During the acute suicidal crisis, suicide 
precautions are carried out as a specialized form of milieu therapy. 
It is important to understand that when a patient is admitted to 
an inpatient psychiatric unit, the nurse must carefully assess and 
prioritize care. As previously noted, the vast majority (90%) of 
patients with suicidal behavior disorder have a comorbid psychi -
atric illness underlying their suicide attempt. Oftentimes, these 
patients self-medicate with alcohol and/or other drugs to treat 
their emotional pain; this may lead to reduced rational thought, 
low frustration tolerance, and impulsivity and may require close 
monitoring for harm directed at self and also toward others.
Teamwork and Safety
Effective management of patients manifesting suicidal behav -
ior requires an interprofessional collaborative approach to 
care. This interprofessional collaborative approach maximizes 
patient safety through timely communication and improved 
coordination of care leading to best outcomes for patients.
Suicide Precautions
In accordance with unit policies and procedures, patients who 
are suicidal are observed continuously by nursing staff. Refer to 
Table 25-4   for a general description of  suicide precautions. This 
intense attention from the nurse provides for safety and allows 
for constant reassessment of risk. Monitoring ﬂow sheets for 
suicide precautions is more clinically useful if they include a de -
scription of affect as well as behavior. For example, instead of 
noting “Patient watching television,” the nurse will describe the 
patient’s affect (hostile, fearful, calm, etc.) at each observation 
interval. Flow sheets should also indicate clear accountability for 
staff starting and ending their periods of observation. In addition 
to observing the patient, the nurse is responsible for monitoring 
the environment for safety hazards. Review  Box 25-4   for guide -
lines on how to minimize physical risks in the environment.
Studies show that acute care of patients who are suicidal is 
usually effective. Suicide risk is highest in the ﬁrst few days of 
admission and during times of staff rotation. Assessment of 
suicidal risk must be an ongoing process; assessment should be 
performed particularly before a change in level of observation 
or upon sudden improvement or worsening of symptoms.
   Counseling
 C o u n s e l i n g  s k i l l s ,  i n c l u d i n g  i n t e r v i e w i n g ,  c r i s i s  c a r e ,  a n d  p r o b -
lem-solving techniques, are used in both inpatient and outpa -
tient settings. The key element is establishing a therapeutic 
alliance to encourage the patient to engage in more realistic 
problem solving. Helpful staff characteristics include warmth, 
sensitivity, interest, and consistency. After hospitalization, the 
nurse may see these patients in the clinic, in a partial hospital 
program, or in home care. One particular aspect of counseling 
is the use of a  no-suicide contract   (also called a  no-harm con -
tract ). This is a written contract in which the patient agrees not 
to harm himself or herself but to take an alternative action if 
feeling suicidal (e.g., talk with staff, call a crisis line). Although 
no literature is available to verify the effectiveness of these 
contracts, they are used to form a clinical agreement between  determinants of life or death, and nurses with good crisis in -
tervention skills are in a position to use, role model, and teach 
these skills to others.
  Tertiary Intervention
   Te r t i a r y  i n te r ve n t i o n   (or  postvention  ) refers to interventions 
with the circle of survivors of a person who has completed 
suicide ( Jordan   & McIntosh, 2010). This is done to both re -
duce the traumatic aftereffects and explore effective means of 
addressing survivor problems using primary and secondary 
interventions. Knowledge regarding grief and loss counseling 
positions nurses to refer, consult, and collaborate in the best 
interests of friends and family. This is vital since the suicide 
rate increases for those who experience loss from suicide. Sur -
vivors of suicide are in immediate need of supportive avenues 
for coping with such complicated grief.

GUIDELINES FOR MINIMIZING 
SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR ON 
THE PSYCHIATRIC UNIT
 
         Use plastic eating utensils, and count utensils upon collection.
   Do not assign patient to a private room, and ensure the door
remains open at all times.
   Jump-proof and hang-proof the bathrooms by installing
breakaway shower rods and recessed shower nozzles.
   Keep electrical cords to a minimal length.
   Install unbreakable glass in windows. Install tamper-proof
screens or partitions too small to pass through. Keep all
windows locked.
   Lock all utility rooms, kitchens, adjacent stairwells, and ofﬁces.
All nonclinical staff (e.g., housekeepers, maintenance workers)
should receive instructions to keep doors locked.
   Take all potentially harmful gifts (e.g., ﬂowers in glass vases) 
from visitors before allowing them to see patients. Search all
items brought to patients by visitors.
   Go through personal belongings with patient present, and
remove all potentially harmful objects (e.g., belts, shoelaces,
metal nail ﬁles, tweezers, matches, razors, perfume, and
shampoo).
   Ensure that visitors do not bring in or leave potentially harmful
objects in patient’s room (e.g., matches, nail ﬁles).
   Search patient for harmful objects (e.g., drugs, sharp objects,
cords) if allowed to leave unit on pass.

tion to prevent suicide ( Simon , 2011).
Health Teaching and Health Promotion
The nurse teaches the patient about psychiatric diagnoses, 
medications and complementary therapies, and age-related 
developmental crises. T eaching is also important regarding 
community resources, coping skills, stress management, and  communication skills. When possible, the family or signiﬁcant 
others are included to strengthen the patient’s support system.
  Case Management

patient with suicidal ideation. The patient’s perception of being 
alone without supports often blinds the person to the real sup -
port ﬁgures who are present. Reconnecting the patient with 
family and friends is a major focus, whether in the hospital or 
the community. Aftercare referrals may include information on 
the following resources: substance treatment centers, crisis ho-
tlines, support groups for patients or families, and recreational 
activities to enhance socialization and self-esteem. Encouraging 
the patient to get reacquainted with a previous spiritual support 
system may also be beneﬁcial.
  Pharmacological Interventions

cidal ideation in regaining self-control is the careful administra-
tion of medication. Medications prescribed to high-risk patients 
are monitored carefully. Lethal overdose is nearly impossible 
with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); however, 
overdose remains a concern with tricyclic antidepressants and 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Mouth checks may be used to 
be sure that patients are not saving (hoarding) medications in 
the hospital; in the community, provision of a limited-day sup-
ply or family supervision is required.

 also caused me to look at my own depression and realize how 
especially vulnerable I am now. If I have any advice for others 
based on my experience, it is to get connected, listen, and be a 
real part of the lives of those you love. That’s the only way you’ll 
know when something is just not right and how desperate 
someone really is. That also applies to friends and family of us 
survivors. Don’t treat us like we’re “contagious.” And please do 
talk about our loss. The worst thing possible is to avoid mention 
of our lost loved one.
Survivors give the following suggestions to health care 
professionals:
  If being a survivor is the main reason treatment has been
sought, remember that the survivor, not the deceased, is the
patient. Focus on the patient’s thoughts and feelings, and do
a thorough assessment as you usually would.
      If you are a friend or relative of a suicide survivor, remember
that the most difﬁcult time for these survivors is not so
much in the immediate aftermath of the suicide; rather, it is
in the weeks, months, and  years following their loss. Make
frequent efforts to reach out to these individuals, especially
on the most difﬁcult anniversary dates. Do not be afraid of
talking about the deceased person; in fact, speak of them
often. While this may seem counterintuitive and uncomfort-
able for most, survivors of suicide universally want their
loved one to be remembered in this way. Talking reduces the
hurt, isolation, and stigma.
If being a survivor comes out as an incidental ﬁnding during
an assessment, ask open-ended questions and evaluate how
much the loss has been resolved.
      Recommend community resources and survivor support
groups and show empathy about the loss of someone
to suicide. Know about local Survivors of Suicide (SOS)
support groups in your area, and refer the survivors and
their families as soon as possible following the suicide.
Staff members who have cared for a patient who completed
suicide within the treatment facility are similarly traumatized by 
suicide. Staff may also experience symptoms of posttraumatic 
stress disorder, with guilt, shock, anger, shame, and decreased 
self-esteem (APA, 2003). Group support is essential as the treat -
ment team conducts a thorough psychological postmortem as -
sessment. The event is carefully reviewed to identify the poten -
tial overlooked clues, faulty judgments, or changes that are 
needed in agency protocols. Most facilities have a clear policy 
about communication with families after suicide. Although 
some lawyers advise having no contact except through them, 
others recommend designating a spokesperson who can address 
the feelings of the family without discussing the details of the 
patient’s care. Referrals should be given to family members to 
assist them in dealing with their grief and to address any emo -
tional problems that develop, especially in adolescents.
As for documentation, staff must ensure that the record is 
complete and that any late entries are identiﬁed. Courts require 
that the patient be periodically evaluated for suicidal risk, that 
the treatment plan provide for high-level security, and that staff 
members follow the individual treatment plan. Despite follow-
ing institution protocols, treatment plans, and the appropriate 
standards of practice, suicides do occasionally still happen. appropriate) teaching about the identiﬁed beneﬁts and risks 
of antidepressant therapy.
There is clear evidence that long-term lithium treatment for 
bipolar disorder and major depression signiﬁcantly reduces suicide 
and suicide attempts. Since lithium does frequently cause seri-
ous side effects and necessitates periodic blood work to test for 
therapeutic levels, patient and family education is important to 
support adherence.
For patients experiencing psychotic or bipolar manic episodes, 
antipsychotic medication is usually ordered. Second-generation 
antipsychotics are preferable to ﬁrst-generation antipsychotics 
because they have fewer adverse effects. Some studies have 
shown a reduced suicide rate among patients with schizophrenia 
receiving clozapine. The use of clozapine must be monitored 
closely, however, because of the risk of severe side effects (e.g., 
agranulocytosis, myocarditis, and altered glucose metabolism).
Finally, antianxiety medication may help to treat panic and 
insomnia. Thus far, no clinical studies have examined the effect 
of antianxiety treatment on suicide risk, but short-term use of 
long-acting benzodiazepines may be helpful for management 
of panic symptoms.
An alternative somatic treatment for acute suicidal risk is 
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Evidence suggests that ECT 
decreases acute suicidal ideation. This treatment is useful for 
certain types of patients with depression or psychosis whose 
behavior is considered life threatening and for whom waiting 
for medication to take effect is not feasible. It is also safe and 
effective for pregnant patients, patients with certain medical 
conditions who cannot tolerate medication, and patients who 
do not respond to multiple trials of medication. 
Postvention for Survivors of Completed Suicide
A discussion of patients with suicidal behavior disorder is 
incomplete without noting the issues surrounding a 
completed suicide. Surviving family and friends may 
experience overwhelming guilt and shame, compounded by 
the difﬁculty of discussing the frequently taboo subject of 
suicide. The usual social supports of neighbors and church 
are sometimes lacking for these mourners. Adolescent 
friends who suffer traumatic grief are more likely to report 
suicidal ideation within 6 years of the suicide (APA, 2003). 
Family members of individuals who complete suicide devel -
op a 4.5-times greater risk of suicide than those in families in 
which no suicide occurred. Despite their suffering, only 
approximately 25% of survivors seek treatment.
One survivor wrote a personal account several years after the 
suicide of her daughter:
If only I hadn’t responded with anger and frustration during 
our last phone call . . .she was angry with herself and seemed 
to want to pick a ﬁght with me—which was the pattern. If I 
could have looked past her angry words and instead tuned into 
the desperation behind them, maybe I could have gotten her to 
open up to me. Now I can only look back and consider the 
many, many times I should have picked up on the severity of 
her illness and how she struggled with it. Her experience has

core values, systems management, and evidence-based clinical 
care practice. This task force believes that suicide is a “never 
event” and that suicide may be eliminated by improved access to 
care and continuous quality improvement.
The quality improvement task force concluded that col-
laborative care must be established as the standard of care for 
the detection, treatment, and management of behavioral 
health problems. T o be effective in achieving suicide as a 
never event, care coordination that is patient-centered and 
encompasses both inpatient and community-based care is 
essential.
  NON-SUICIDAL SELF-INJURY
 Another closely related problem to suicidal behavior is  non-
suicidal self-injury  . This problem is manifested by deliberate 
and direct attempts to cause bodily harm that does not result 
in death ( Nock , 2010). Sometimes referred to as  parasuicide, 
this behavior most commonly consists of cutting/carving, 
burning, scraping/scratching skin, biting, hitting, skin pick-
ing, and interfering with wound healing. Half of self-injurers 
report multiple methods ( Klonsky , 2011). For these behav -
iors to be considered signiﬁcant, they typically last at least 
a year and happen repeatedly.
 E v e n  w h e n  t h e y  a r e  n o t  e n g a g e d  i n  t h e  b e h a v i o r s ,  s e l f - i n j u r -
ers tend to be thinking about self-injury. Self-injurious actions 
are most often done with the intent to either alleviate psychic 
pain or to pierce the psychic numbness these individuals de-
scribe. Other times, these actions are used to punish themselves, 
to connect with others, to get attention, to escape a responsibil -
ity or to avoid a situation.
Prevalence
  T h e  l i f e t i m e  p r e v a l e n c e  o f  n o n - s u i c i d a l  s e l f - i n j u r y  i n  a d o l e s -
cents was estimated from 13% to 23% (Jacobson & Gould, 
2007). It is a global problem with similar prevalence rates 
worldwide ( Muehlenkamp   et al., 2012). Non-suicidal self-
injury begins between 10 to 15 years of age, peaking in the late 
teens. Hospital admission data conﬁrm a decline in the behavior 
between 25 to 29 years of age ( Crosby , Ortega, & Melanson, 
2011).  Klonsky  (2011) estimates that 5.9% of the U.S. population 
have engaged in non-suicidal self-injury within their lifetime.
Research regarding prevalence by gender is inconclusive. 
Some studies demonstrate that it is more common among 
females while other studies ﬁnd a higher prevalence in males. 
What does seem to be clear is that self-injury is more visible 
among females than males (Whitlock et al., 2009).
  Comorbidity
In a study of college students, risk factors for non-suicidal 
self-injury were depression in either parent, non-heterosex-
ual orientation, and depression ( Wilcox  et al., 2012). Person -
ality disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder, 
are associated with non-suicidal self-injury in adolescence 
and adulthood ( Nitkowski   & Petermann, 2011). Anxiety and 
substance use disorders are considered to be co-occurring 
disorders with self-injurious behaviors.This is especially the case for patients in the community. 
Human behavior is simply not predictable.
Advanced Practice Interventions
The psychiatric advanced practice nurse (APRN) may treat 
suicidal patients directly with psychotherapy, psychobiological 
interventions, clinical supervision for direct care staff, or con-
sultation in nonpsychiatric settings (e.g., health care unit, nurs-
ing home, or forensic site). Following hospitalization, the APRN 
provides aftercare for the patient with coexisting psychiatric 
disorders, including individual therapy and family therapy.
   EVALUATION

nurse must be constantly alert to changes in the patient’s 
mood, thinking, and behavior. The nurse also looks for indi-
cations that the patient is communicating thoughts and feel-
ings more readily and that the patient’s social network is 
widening. For example, if the person is able to talk about his 
or her feelings and engage in problem solving with the nurse, 
this is a positive sign.
The nurse must remember that  suicidal behavior is the 
result of interpersonal turmoil . If an episode of major depres -
sion is the main admitting diagnosis and a serious suicidal 
gesture resulted from this depression, both problems are ini -
tially assessed and treated. When the patient is no longer 
an acute suicide risk, treating the suicidal ideation and de-
pressive disorder becomes the main focus of care. Essentially, 
the nurse evaluates each short-term goal and establishes new 
ones as the patient progresses toward the long-term goal of 
resolving suicidal ideation.
Once stabilized, the patient may qualify for transfer to an 
intensive outpatient (IOP) treatment program, which involves 
continuing treatment after discharge, or a partial hospitaliza -
tion program (PHP) that allows patients to go home in the 
evening to practice new coping skills. Community-based sup -
port groups are also available that are effective and ﬁnancially 
affordable for the patient. Nurses should be knowledgeable 
about, and proactive in, referring patients to these support 
groups. Due to the increasing numbers of uninsured and 
underinsured patients, nurses should familiarize themselves 
regarding reimbursement systems and treatment options avail -
able in their communities.

Suicide  and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury 16
   Etiology
Biological Factors
Studies related to the physiological mechanism of action in non-
suicidal self-injury are inconclusive; however, researchers continue 
to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms behind the disorder. 
Several neurochemical pathways in the brain are proposed to play 
a role in the development of these behaviors (Bloom & Holly, 
2011). Recently, studies have determined that individuals who en -
gage in self-injury have lower levels of cerebrospinal ﬂuid endoge -
nous opiods when compared with individuals who do not engage 
in the behaviors ( Stanley  et al., 2010). Although studies are incon -
clusive, the neurotransmitter group of monoamines including se -
rotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine may play a role in the 
mediation of self-injury, and research is ongoing. As practitioners 
continue to search for an effective treatment, clinical research will 
seek to ﬁnd the neurobiological basis of non-suicidal self-injury.
  Cultural Factors
Recent studies have investigated the prevalence of non-suicidal 
self-injury behaviors internationally to determine best practices 
for treatment and whether culturally different approaches 
to care are relevant. Similar rates of the behavior are reported 
among adolescents in the Midwestern states and southern 
Germany; however, these rates differ signiﬁcantly from the 
Netherlands and Belgium. In European countries, German ado -
lescents have the highest rates of the behavior (10.4%) with the 
lowest rates among Romanian youth (1.9%)( Kaess  et al., 2011).  The behavior has stabilized among youth over the last 5 years, 
with no signiﬁcant increases internationally ( Muehlenkamp  
et al., 2012). With this stabilization in occurrence, researchers 
will have opportunity to further investigate cultural differences 
in the behavior and whether these differences lead to different 
treatment modalities.
  Societal Factors
Many people believe that self-injurious behaviors such as cut -
ting are a social phenomenon that is rampant in society. Social 
media such as Y ouTube may have a tremendous impact on 
the culture at-large. In one study researchers found that top 
100 videos related to self-injurious behaviors were viewed over 
2 million times ( Lewis  et al., 2011). Viewers tended to rate these 
videos positively despite the explicit imagery of self-injury, 
most commonly self-cutting.
Summary of Nursing Implications
Nonacute suicidal or self-destructive thoughts and feelings are 
generally treated in the outpatient setting. Alternate services 
available to patients with suicidal ideation include crisis inter -
vention and assertive community treatment (ACT), addiction 
treatment, social services, and legal assistance. These types of 
interventions are evidence based and cost effective, as well as 
individualized and realistic—all essential aspects of the person-
centered recovery model (American Psychiatric Nurses Associa -
tion & International Society of Psychiatric Nurses, 2007).
     KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER
 
   Suicide is a significant public health problem in the United
States.
      Speciﬁc biological, psychosocial, and cultural factors are known to
increase the risk of suicide.
      Most patients with suicidal ideation may be helped by treatment of a
coexisting psychiatric disorder.
  Certain health conditions and psychiatric diagnoses are associated
with increased risk for suicide.
   Every suicide attempt must be taken seriously, even if the person
has a history of multiple attempts.
   The nurse may have a real impact on suicide prevention through
primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions.Nursing care of the patient who is suicidal is challenging but re-
warding; patients’ desperate feelings evoke intense reactions in staff, 
but most people with suicidal behaviors respond to treatment and 
do not complete suicide.
If a patient completes suicide, family, friends, and health care
workers are traumatized and need support, possibly including re-
ferrals for psychiatric treatment.
 A principle of quality improvement is that suicide is a "never
event" that should be eliminated by improved access to care, con-
tinuous quality improvement, and collaborative care.
Non-suicidal self-injury is a problem that is becoming increasingly
important, especially among young people.
    CRITICAL THINKING
 1.Locate and review the suicide protocol at your hospital unit or
community center. Are there any steps you anticipate having 
difficulty carrying out? Discuss these difficulties with your peers or 
clinical group.
2 .  How would you respond to another staff member who ex -
presses guilt o ver the completed suicide of a patient on your unit? 
 3. Identify three common and expected emotional reactions that a
nurse might have when initially working with persons who mani-
fest suicidal behavior disorder.
a .   How do you think you might react?
     b .  What actions could you take to deal with the event and
obtain support?

1.  Diet 
 
The GAPS Diet is made out of three stages:   
 
1. GAPS Introduction Diet   
2. The Full  GAPS Diet  
3. Coming off the GAPS Diet.   
 
Please, read in detail about these stages in the GAPS book.  
 
 
2. Supplementation   
 
The essential supplements for GAPS patients:  
 
A.    An effective therapeutic strength probiotic  
B.    Essential Fatty Acids  
C.    Vitamin A  
D.    Digestive enzymes  
E.    Vitamin and mineral supplements.  
 
 
        A.  An effective therapeutic strength   
           probiotic  
 
            Probiotics are most commonly used in the   
            treatment of gastro -intestinal disorders:  
 viral infections of the digestive tract  
 necrotising enterocolitis in infants  
 intractable pediatric diarrhea  
 pseudomembranous colitis  
 traveler's diarrhea  
 Clostridium Difficile enterocolitis  enterocolitis  
 Helicobacter  infection  
 enteropathogenic  E. coli  infec tion 
 inflammatory bowel disorders: Crohn's disease, ulcerative 
colitis  and chronic pouchitis  
 irritable bowel syndrome  
 lactose intolerance  
 prevention of colonic cancer in laboratory studied  
                 
                In addition to digestive issues ma ny other   
                health problems  have been shown to   
                respond to treatment with probiotics:  
 allergies including food allergy  
 autism  
 chronic viral infections  
 urogenital infections  
 hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and biliary disease  
 tuberc ulosis  
 meningitis  
 malignancy  
 arthritis  
 diabetes  
 burns of various degree  
 perioperative care and intensive care in surgical patients and patients 
with massive blood loss  
 clinical infections  
 autoimmune disorders  
                While many conditions may benefit from   
                the use of probiotics, the above list has   
                had scientific papers published  on the   
                benefit  of probiotics with the specific   
                condition.  
 
 
                General Guidelines for choosing a good   
                probiotic:  
 
                    a.    A good probiotic should have as   
                          many different  species of beneficial   
                          bacteria as possible.  
 
                    b.    A mixture of strains from different   
                          groups of  probiotic bacteria is more   
                          beneficial than just  one group.  
 
                    c.    A good probiotic should have a   
                          concentrated  amount of bacteria: at   
                          least 8 billion of bacterial  cells per     
                          gram.    
 
                    d.    The manufacturer of the probiotic   
                           should test every batch for s trength   
                           and bacterial composition and   
                           should be prepared to publish   
                           the results.  
         
        (Bio-kult is the recommended probiotic and   
         Dr. Campbell -McBride  is one of the   
         inventors)      
 
 
        B.  Essential Fatty Acids  
 
            GAPS children and adults should have a   
            group of essential oils  supplemented:  
 
                a.    A good seed/nut oil blend in the ratio   
                      of 2:1 of  omega -3:omega -6 fatty acids.  
 
                b.    Cod liver oil to supply EPA, DHA,   
                       vitamin A and  vitamin D.  
 
                c.    Fish oil with higher ratio of EPA to   
                       DHA, as more EPA  seems to be   
                       beneficial for GAPS patients.   There   
                       are no toxic levels for these oils.  
        C.  Vitamin A  
 
            As listed previously, vitamin A is   
            recommended in the form of  Cod Liver Oil   
            (CLO).   Vitamin A deficiency can   
            cause  digestive problems.  
 
            Leaky gut and malabsorption are the typical   
            results of  vitamin A deficiency.    
            Unfortunately, due to digestive problems,   
            GAPS children and adults usually cannot   
            absorb or use many forms of vitamin A,   
            commonly found in supplements.  
 
            A natural form of vitamin A found in  CLO   
            appears to be the  best form for these patients.  
 
              
        D.  Digestive Enzymes    
 
            People with abnormal gut flora almost   
            without exception have low stomach acid   
            production.   Toxins produced from bacteria   
            such as  Candida  and Clostridia  have a   
            strong ability to reduce secretion of stomach   
            acid.  
 
            Stomach acid is the first barrier for huge   
            numbers of microbes  arriving with every   
            bite of food or drink we consume.   If  
            the stom ach is not acid enough, these bad   
            microbes may have a chance of colonizing in   
            the stomach itself.  
 
            Dr. Campbell -McBride recommends that   
            GAPS patients  supplement with stomach   
            acid.   The most ph ysiological preparation      
            available is Betaine HCl with Pepsin.  
 
 
                Pancreatic Enzymes  
 
                These are the enzymes people generally   
                think of when  hearing the   
                words "digestive enzymes".    These   
                enzymes are usually combinations of   
                proteases, peptidases, lipases, amylase,   
                lactase and cellulase.  
 
                In a healthy digestive tract, these e nzymes   
                are naturally produced by the pancreas.   If  
                normal stomach acidity can be returned,   
                these enzymes should work efficiently.  
 
                Dr. Campbell -McBride recommends   
                supplemen tation with stomach acid.   If  
                you feel benefit from the use of these   
                supplements, make sure they do not   
                contain fillers or binders which may   
                interfere with the healing process in  the  
                gut. 
        E.  Vitamin and Mineral Supplements  
 
            Dr. Campbell -McBride does not generally   
            recommend any  vitamin or mineral   
            supplementation at the beginning of the   
            program.  
 
            Some pat ients may require targeted   
            supplementation but this is a matter for a   
            qualified practitioner to decide.  
 
 
            If you are going to use supplements:  
 
                a.    Choose supplements without any   
                       ingredients which  may aggravate the   
                       gut condition.   
  
                b.    Choose supplements with a high   
                       absorption rate.   
 
                c.    Keep supplements to an absolute   
                       minimum.  
 
 
3.  DETOXIFICATION AND LIFE -STYLE CHANGES  
 
The first and most important thing is to remove the main source of toxicity, which means 
cleaning up and healing the gut.    
 
Since  this alone will not rid the body of years worth of toxic build up in the  system, juicing is 
recommended.   Juicing provides very concentrated fruit and vegetable nutrients to the body 
in an easily absorbed form.    
 
Black Elderberry is also beneficial and  has strong immune -stimulating properties and it is one 
of the most powerfu l anti -viral remedies known to man.   
 
        The General Toxic Load  
 
        An important part of the treatment is reduction of the general  toxic load.   Keep your 
house        chemical free and avoid  bringing anything into the home which will let off 
chem icals such   as new carpet, furniture, and paints.   Also  remember that your skin absorbs 
just about everything it comes in contact with so be very  cautious with the  products you put 
on your skin.   Household plants are great at reducing  the toxic air in our  houses.   They 
consume the toxic gases and replace them with  oxygen and other beneficial substances.   
  
This is a brief summary  of important points  addressed in  Gut and Psychology Syndrome .  It is 
very important to read the sections devoted to these areas in the book for a clear 
understanding of each.  Dr. Natasha Campbell -McBride also provides additional information 
on her website www.gaps.me.  
Getting Started  
Starting a new diet can seem very overwhelming. When you have digestive issues 
it is even worse. Here we provide some recommendations on getting started.   
 
Essential Beginning Supplies  
 Gut and Psychology Syndrome  by Dr. Natasha Campbell -McBride  
 Therapeutic  strength probiotic (Bio -kult is recommended)  
 Organic meats and vegetables including meat bones for stock  
 Safer household and personal care products  
 Cooking supplies  for making meat stocks and fermented vegetables  
(If finances are an issue, finish the prod ucts you have and replace them with more 
natural products.   There are also some very inexpensive natural solutions you can 
find for household cleaners using vinegar, baking soda, and lemon.   Search online 
for some fast and easy recipes that are just as eff ective and cost only pennies.)  
Helpful (Non -essential) Beginning Supplies  
 Food processor  
 Juicer  
 Grinder (for making nut flours and nut butters)  
 Freezer containers  
WHERE TO BEGIN  
 
Read  Gut and Psychology Syndrome  by Dr. Natasha Campbell -McBride.   It is 
very important to fully understand the GAPS Diet before you start.   Starting the 
diet incorrectly may lead to unnecessary diarrhea, constipation, severe die -off 
symptoms, and hunger pains.  
 
Be Patient!   Please remember that this is going to be a slow process.   You should 
not do the GAPS Diet unless you are willing to fully commit to doing it properly 
and are willing to stick it out for 2 years if necessary.   While some people notice 
immediate improvements, all progress will be very individual.  
 
Start Slow.   Depending on your current diet and digestive health, transitioning to 
the GAPS Diet may be a dramatic change.   The Introduction Diet will be a 
necessary first step for those with serious digestive problems and food 
intolerances.   
Be Prepared.   It may be benef icial to do a few trial runs before going into the Full 
GAPS Diet or Introduction Diet.   Try making sauerkraut or fermented vegetables 
and meat or fish stocks.   Once you have a good handle on these recipes, all other 
GAPS foods  should seem relatively easy.   
 
 
Once you are ready to start, we recommend starting with the Introduction 
Diet to allow your body to adjust to the changes gradually.   If you do not have 
serious digestive problems or food intolerances, you should be able to move 
through the Introductio n Diet in a matter of days.   
 
GAPS Introduction Diet  
Gut and Psychology Syndrome Introduction Diet  
 
Dr. Natasha Campbell -McBride recommends that GAPS patients follow the Introduction Diet 
before going into the Full GAPS Diet.   Depending on the severity of the condition, you can 
move through the Introduction Diet as fast or as slow as the condition will p ermit.  Please 
find some helpful information below for getting started.  Please reference Dr. Campbell -
McBride's book  Gut and Psychology Syndrome  for detailed information.   Please note:  It is 
essential to have the book  Gut and Psychology Syndrome  to implement the GAPS 
diet effectively.  
  
 
Following the Introduction Diet fully is essential for people with serious digestive 
symptoms : diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, some cases of constipation, etc.   The 
Introduction Diet will reduce the symptoms q uickly and initiate the healing process in the 
digestive system.   Even for healthy people, following the Introduction Diet when 
experiencing a  "tummy bug" or diarrhea will clear the symptoms quickly and permanently 
usually without needing medication.  
 
Cons tipation    
In cases of stubborn constipation, introduce freshly pressed juices earlier in the diet, from 
stage 2: start from carrot juice first thing in the morning and take your cod liver oil at the 
same time.   The juice will stimulate bile production as many cases of persistent constipation 
are due to poor bile production.   When there is not enough bile, the fats in the food do not 
digest well; instead they react with salts and form soap in the gut, causing 
constipation.   Removing dairy may also help.    
 
Food Allergies and Intolerances  
People with food allergies and intolerances should go through the Introduction Diet in order 
to heal and seal their gut lining.   The reason for allergies and food intolerances is so -called 
"leaky gut" when the gut lining is damaged by abnormal micro flora.   Foods do not get the 
chance to be digested properly before they get absorbed through this damaged wall and cause 
the immune system to react to them.   Many people try to identify which foods they react 
to.  However, with da maged gut wall they are likely to absorb most of their foods partially 
digested, which may cause an immediate reaction or a delayed reaction (a day, a few days or 
even a couple of weeks later).   As these reactions overlap with each other, you can never be 
sure what exactly you are reacting to on any given day.   Testing for food allergies in 
notoriously unreliable: if one had enough resources to test twice a day for two weeks, they 
would find that they are "allergic" to everything they eat.   As long as the g ut wall is damaged 
and stays damaged, you can be juggling your diet forever removing different foods and never 
get anywhere.   From my clinical experience it is best to concentrate on healing the gut wall 
with the Introduction Diet.   Once the gut wall is he aled, the foods will be digested properly 
before being absorbed, which will remove most food intolerances and allergies.  
 
Those without serious digestive problems and food intolerances can move through the 
Introduction Diet quite quickly.   However, please d o not be tempted to skip the 
Introduction Diet and go straight into the Full GAPS Diet,  because the Introduction Diet 
will give your patient the best chance to optimise the healing process in the gut and the rest of 
the body.   Skipping the Introduction Die t may lead to long -term lingering problems, difficult 
to deal with.  
 
If you have decided to go straight into the Full GAPS Diet , keep in mind that about 85% 
of everything your patient eats daily should be made out of meats, fish, eggs, fermented dairy 
and vegetables (some well -cooked, some fermented and some raw).   Baking and fruit should 
be kept out of the diet for a few weeks, and then be limited to snacks between meals and 
should not replace the main meals.   Homemade meat stock, soups, stews and natural fats are 
not optional - they should be your patient's staples.  
 
*Note:   Those who start with the Introduction Diet will introduce dairy earlier than those who 
go right into the full GAPS diet.   Always do a sensitivity test prior to introducing dairy.

2.  The Full GAPS Diet with the typical menu  
 
INTRODUCTION DIET  
 
EVERY MORNING  
 
Start the day with a cup of still mineral or filtered water.   Give yo ur patient the 
probiotic.   Make sure that the water is warm or room temperature, not cold, as cold will 
aggravate his or her condition.    
 
Only foods listed are allowed: your patient must not have anything else.   On the First Stage 
the most drastic symptom s of abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation will quickly 
subside.   If, when you introduce a new food, your patient gets back diarrhea, pain or any 
other digestive symptoms then he/she is not ready for that food to be introduced.   Wait for a 
week and try  again.   
 
If you suspect an allergy to any particular food, before introducing it do the  Sensitivity 
Test.   
 
SENSITIVITY TEST  
 
Take a drop of the food in question (if the food is solid, mash and mix with a bit of water) 
and place it on the inside of the w rist of the patient.   Do it at bedtime.   Let the drop dry on the 
skin, then let your patient go to sleep.   In the morning check the spot: if there is an angry red 
reaction, then avoid that food for a few weeks, and then try again.   If there is no reaction,  then 
go ahead and introduce it gradually starting from a small amount.  
 
 
STAGE 1  
 
Homemade meat or fish stock.    
Meat and fish stocks provide building blocks for the rapidly growing cells of the gut lining 
and they have a soothing effect on any areas of i nflammation in the gut.   That is why they aid 
digestion and have been known for centuries as healing folk remedies for the digestive 
tract.   Do not use commercially available soup stock granules or bullion cubes, they are 
highly processed and are full of d etrimental ingredients.   Chicken stock is particularly gentle 
on the stomach and is very good to start from.   To make good meat stock you need joints, 
bones, a piece of meat on the bone, a whole chicken, giblets from chicken, goose or duck, 
whole pigeons, pheasants or other inexpensive meats.   It is essential to use bones and joints, 
as they provide the healing substances, not so much the muscle meats.   Ask the butcher to cut 
in half the large tubular bones, so you can get the bone marrow out of them after 
cooking.   Put the bones, joints and meats into a large pan and fill it with water, add natural 
unprocessed salt to your taste at the beginning of cooking and about a teaspoon of black 
peppercorns, roughly crushed.   Bring to boil, cover and simmer on a low heat for 2.5 -3 
hours.   You can make fish stock the same way using a whole fish or fish fins, bones and 
heads.   After cooking take the bones and meats out and sieve the stock to remove small bones 
and peppercorns.   Strip off all the soft tissues from the bo nes as best as you can to later add to 
soups or encourage your patient to eat all the soft tissues on the bones.   Extract the bone 
marrow out of large tubular bones while they are still warm: to do that bang the bone on a 
thick wooden chopping board.   The gelatinous soft tissues around the bones and the bone 
marrow provide some of the best healing remedies for the gut lining and the immune system; 
your patient needs to consume them with every meal.   Take off all the soft tissues from fish 
bones and heads an d reserve for adding to soups later.   The meat or fish stock will keep well 
in the fridge for at least 7 days or it can be frozen.   Keep giving your patient warm meat stock 
as a drink all day with his meals and between meals.   Do not use microwaves for war ming up 
the stock , use conventional stove (microwaves destroy food).   It is very important for your 
patient to consume all the fat in the stock and off the bones as these fats are essential for the 
healing process.   Add some probiotic food into every cup o f stock (the details about 
introducing probiotic food follow).  
 
Homemade soup with your homemade meat or fish stock.  
Please look for some recipe ideas in the recipe section of the book.   Here we will go through 
some details, specific for the Introduction D iet.  Bring some of the meat stock to boil, add 
chopped or sliced vegetables: onions, carrots, broccoli, leeks, cauliflower, courgettes, 
marrow, squash, pumpkin, etc. and simmer for 25 -35 minutes.   You can choose any 
combination of available vegetables avo iding very fibrous ones, such as all varieties of 
cabbage and celery.   All particularly fibrous parts of vegetables need to be removed, such as 
skin and seeds on pumpkins, marrows and squashes, stalk of broccoli and cauliflower and any 
other parts that loo k too fibrous.   Cook the vegetables well, so they are really soft.   When 
vegetables are well cooked, add 1 -2 tablespoons of chopped garlic, bring to boil and turn the 
heat off.   Give your patient this soup with the bone marrow and meats and other soft tiss ues, 
which you cut off the bones.   You can blend the soup using a soup blender or serve it as it 
is.  Add some probiotic food into every bowl of soup (the details about introducing probiotic 
foods follow).   Your patient should eat these soups with boiled m eat and other soft tissues off 
the bones as often as he/she wants to all day.  
 
Probiotic foods are essential to introduce right from the beginning.  
These can be dairy based or vegetable based.   To avoid any reactions introduce probiotic 
foods gradually, st arting from 1 -2 teaspoons a day for 2 -5 days, then 3 -4 teaspoons a day for 
2-5 days and so on until you can add a few teaspoons of the probiotic food into every cup of 
meat stock and every bowl of soup.   If your patient is ready to introduce dairy, then us e your 
homemade yogurt or kefir.   If dairy is still out [by results of sensitivity test or negative 
reaction when introducing it], then into every cup of meat stock or soup add juice from your 
homemade sauerkraut, fermented vegetables or vegetable medley ( please look in the recipe 
section of the book).   Make sure that the food is not too hot when adding the probiotic foods, 
as the heat would destroy the beneficial probiotic bacteria.  
 
Ginger tea with a little honey between meals.  
To make ginger tea, grate s ome fresh ginger root (about a teaspoonful) into your teapot and 
pour some boiling water over it, cover and leave for 3 -5 minutes.   Pour through a small sieve 
and add honey to taste (optional).  
 
 
STAGE 2  
 
Continue with Stage 1.  
Keep giving your patient the  soups with bone marrow, boiled meats or fish and other soft 
tissues off the bones.   He or she should keep drinking the meat stock and ginger tea.   Keep 
adding some probiotic food into every cup of meat stock and every bowl of soup: juices from 
sauerkraut,  fermented vegetables or vegetable medley, or homemade kefir/yogurt.  
 
Add raw organic egg yolks.  
It is best to have egg yolks raw added to every bowl of soup and every cup of meat 
stock.   Start from 1 egg yolk a day and gradually increase until your patien t has an egg yolk 
with every bowl of soup.   When egg yolks are well tolerated add soft -boiled eggs to the soups 
(the whites cooked and the yolks still runny).   If you have any concerns about egg allergy, do 
the sensitivity test first.   There is no need to limit number of egg yolks per day, as they absorb 
quickly almost without needing any digestion and will provide your patient with wonderful 
and most needed nutrition.   Get your eggs from a source you trust: fresh, free range and 
organic.  
 
Add stews and cas seroles made with meats and vegetables.  
Avoid spices at this stage; just make the stew with salt and fresh herbs (look for a recipe of 
Italian Casserole in the recipe section of the book).   The fat content of these meals must be 
quite high: the more fresh animal fats your patient consumes, the quicker he or she will 
recover.   Add some probiotic food into every serving.  
 
Increase daily amount of homemade yogurt and kefir, if introduced.   Increase the 
amount of juice from sauerkraut, fermented vegetables or v egetable medley.  
 
Introduce fermented fish, starting from one piece a day and gradually increasing.   Look 
for recipes in recipe section.  
 
Introduce homemade ghee, starting from 1 teaspoon a day and gradually 
increasing.   Look for recipe in recipe section.  
 
 
STAGE 3  
 
Carry on with all the previous foods.  
 
Add ripe avocado mashed into soups, starting from 1 -3 teaspoons and gradually 
increasing the amount.  
 
Add pancakes, starting from one pancake a day and gradually increasing the amount.  
Make these pancakes w ith three ingredients: 1) organic nut butter (almond, walnut, peanut, 
etc); 2) eggs; 3) a piece of fresh winter squash, marrow or courgette (peeled, de -seeded and 
well blended in a food processor).   Fry small thin pancakes using ghee, goose fat or duck 
fat.  Make sure not to burn them.  
 
Egg scrambled with plenty of ghee, goose fat or duck fat.  
Serve it with avocado (if well tolerated) and cooked vegetables.   Cooked onion is particularly 
good for the digestive system and the immune system: melt 3 tablespoons  of duck fat or ghee 
in the pan, add sliced large white onion, cover and cook for 20 -30 minutes on low heat.  
 
Introduce the sauerkraut and your fermented vegetables (your patient has been 
drinking the juices from them for a while now).  
Start from a small a mount, gradually increasing to 1 -2 tablespoons of sauerkraut or fermented 
vegetables per every meal.  
 
 
STAGE 4  
 
Carry on with all previous foods.  
 
Gradually add meats cooked by roasting and grilling (but not barbecued or fried yet).  
Avoid bits, which are b urned or too brown.   Let your patient eat the meat with cooked 
vegetables and sauerkraut (or other fermented vegetables).  
 
Start adding cold pressed olive oil to the meals, starting from a few drops per meal and 
gradually increasing the amount to 1 -2 table spoons per meal.  
 
Introduce freshly pressed juices, starting from a few spoonfuls of carrot juice.  
Make sure that the juice is clear, filter it well.   Let your patient drink it slowly or diluted with 
warm water or mixed with some homemade yogurt.   If well tolerated gradually increase to a 
full cua a day.   When a full cup of carrot juice is well tolerated try to add to it juice from 
celery, lettuce and fresh mint leaves.   Your patient should drink the juice on an empty 
stomach, so first thing in the morning and middle of afternoon are good times.  
 
Try to bake bread with ground almonds or any other nut and seeds ground into flour.  
The recipe (please look in recipe section of the book) requires only four ingredients: 1) nut 
flour; 2) eggs; 3) piece of fresh win ter squash, marrow or courgette (peeled, de -seeded and 
finely sliced); 4) some natural fat (ghee, butter, goose or duck fat) and some salt to 
taste.   Your patient should start from a small piece of bread per day and gradually increase 
the amount.  
 
 
STAGE 5  
 
If all the previous foods are well tolerated try to add cooked apple as an apple pure.  
Peel and core ripe cooking apples and stew them with a bit of water until soft.   When cooked 
add some shee to it and mash with a potato masher.   If ghee has not bee in troduced yet add 
duck or goose fat.   Start from a few spoonfuls a day.   Watch for any reaction.   If there is none 
gradually increase the amount.  
 
Add raw vegetables starting from softer parts of lettuce and peeled cucumber.  
Watch your patient's stool.   Again start from a small amount and gradually increase if well 
tolerated.   After those two vegetables are well tolerated gradually add other raw vegetables: 
carrot, tomato, onion, cabbage, etc.  
 
If the juice made from carrot, celery, lettuce and mint is well tolerated, start adding 
fruit to it: apple, pineapple and mango.   Avoid citrus fruit at this stage.  
 
 
STAGE 6  
 
If all the introduced foods are well tolerated try some peeled raw apple.   Gradually 
introduce raw fruit and more honey.  
 
Gradually introduce bak ing cakes and other sweet things allowed on the diet.   Use dried 
fruit as a sweetener in the baking.  
 
 
As I mentioned before, your patient may be able to move through the Introduction Diet faster 
or slower depending on the stool changes: let the diarrhea s tart clearing before moving to the 
next stage.   You may have to introduce some foods later than in the program depending on 
his/her sensitivities.   Make sure that you carry on with the soups and meat stock after your 
patient has completed the Introduction Diet at least once a day.  
 
After the Introduction Diet is completed and when your patient has more or less normal 
stools move into the Full GAPS Diet.  
 
 
THE FULL GAPS DIET  
 
A Typical Menu:  
 
Start the day with a glass of still mineral water or filtered wate r with a slice of lemon.   It 
can be warm or cold to personal preference.  
 
If you have a juicer your patient can start the day with a glass of freshly pressed 
fruit/vegetable juice diluted with water.  
A good juice to start the day is 40% apple + 50% carrot + 10% beetroot (all raw of 
course).   You can make all sorts of juice mixes, but generally try to have 50% of therapeutic 
ingredients: carrot, small amount of beetroot (no more than 5 -10% of juice mixture), celery, 
cabbage, lettuce, greens (spinach, parsley , dill, basil, fresh nettle leaves, beet tops, carrot 
tops), white and red cabbage, and 50% of some tasty ingredients to disguise the taste of 
therapeutic ingredients: pineapple, apple, orange, grapefruit, grapes, mango, etc.   Your 
patient can have these j uices as they are, with some yogurt or diluted with water.  
 
 
Every day our bodies go through a 24 hour cycle of activity and rest, feeding and cleaning up 
(detoxifying).   From about 4 am til about 10 am the body is in the cleaning up or 
detoxification mode .  Drinking water and freshly pressed juices will assist in this 
process.   Loading the body with food at that time interferes with the detoxification.   That is 
why many of us do not feel hungry first thing in the morning.   It is better to have breakfast 
around 10 am when your body has completed the detox stage and is ready for feeding.   At 
that stage we usually start feeling hungry.   Children may be ready for their breakfast earlier 
than adults.  
 
 
BREAKFAST CHOICES  
A variation of English breakfast: eggs coo ked to personal liking and served with sausages and 
vegetables, some cooked, some fresh as a salad (tomato, cucumber, onions, celery, and fresh 
salad greens, etc.) and/or avocado and/or meat.   The yolks are best uncooked that the whites 
cooked.   Use plenty  of cold pressed olive oil as a dressing on the salad and eggs.   Mix a 
tablespoon of pre -soaked or sprouted sunflower and/or sesame and/or pumpkin seeds with the 
salad.   Sausages (full fat) should be made of pure minced meat with only salt and pepper 
added .  Make sure that there are no commercial seasonings or MSG (Monosodium 
Glutamate) in the sausages.   I recommend finding a local butcher, who would make pure 
meat sausages for you on order  
 
Avocado with meat, fish or shellfish, vegetables raw and cooked, l emon and cold pressed 
olive oil.   Serve a cup of warm meat stock as a drink with food.  
 
Pancakes made with ground nuts.   These pancakes are delicious with some butter with honey, 
or as a savory snack.   If you blend some fresh or defrosted berries with hone y, it will make a 
delicious jam to have with pancakes.   Weak tea with lemon, ginger tea or mint tea.  
 
Any of the home baked goods: muffins, fruit cake and bread.  
 
 
LUNCH CHOICES  
 
Homemade vegetable soup or stew in a homemade meat stock.  
 
Avocado with meat,  fish, shellfish and raw and/or cooked vegetables.   Use olive oil with 
some lemon squeezed over it as a dressing.   Serve a cup of warm homemade meat stock as a 
drink.  
 
Any meat/fish dish with vegetables.  
 
 
DINNER CHOICES  
 
One of the dishes from the lunch o r breakfast choices.   
 
There are many recipes found in the book.   You can also take old recipes and give them your 
own GAPS diet update.  
 
The Diet  
THE FULL GAPS DIET  
For many GAPS patients, the diet should be followed for two years at least.   The 
book  Gut & Psychology Syndrome  will provide recipes and more explanation about the 
diet.   
 
The best foods are eggs (if tolerated), fresh meats (not preserved), fish, shellfish, fresh 
vegetables and fruit, nuts and seeds, garlic and olive oil.   Apart from eating v egetables 
cooked, it is important to have some raw vegetables with meals, as they contain vital 
enzymes to assist digestion of the meats.   Fruit should be eaten on their own, not with 
meals, as they have a very different digestion pattern and can make the work harder for 
the stomach.   Fruit should be given as a snack between meals.  
 
It is very important to have plenty of natural fats in every meal from meats, butter, 
ghee, coconut (if tolerated) and cold pressed olive oil.   Animal fats on meats are 
particul arly valuable.   Fermented foods (sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir) are also a very 
important part of this diet in addition to homemade meat or fish stock.   It is 
recommended to take a cup of warm meat or fish stock with every meal as a drink as 
well as soups and stews made with the meat or fish stock.   The stock, kefir and 
fermented vegetables will over time restore the stomach acid production, which will 
improve digestion.  
It is best to avoid processed foods (any packet or tinned foods).   They are stripped fr om 
most nutrients that were present in the fresh ingredients used for making these 
foods.   They are a hard work for the digestive system and they damage the healthy gut 
flora balance.   On top of that they usually contain a lot of artificial chemicals, 
detrimental to health, like preservatives, colorants, etc.   Try to buy foods in the form 
that nature made them, as fresh as possible.

   S u i c i d e  is the action of intentionally taking one’s own 
life. In England, suicide historically was considered 
an offense against the king. During the 1930s, many 
people in the United States committed suicide after 
the stock market crash that began the Great Depres-
sion in 1929. During World War II, Japanese kamikaze 
pilots intentionally sacriﬁced their lives for political 
and religious principles. In some societies, suicide is 
acceptable, but Western societies generally consider 
suicide as an immoral act committed by desperate or 
mentally ill individuals.
Suicide has historically served as a solution to life’s 
great obstacles. Today we struggle with the dilemmas 
of rational suicide, freedom of choice, and physician-
assisted suicide. Discussions about the morality or le-
gality of suicide will grow and fade, but the ending of 
life by one’s own hands continues to occur as people 
struggle for control over their situations.
CONTINUUM OF BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES
According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, safety and 
security are basic requirements for life. Individuals 
behave in many ways to secure these needs. Some 
people respond with behaviors that promote growth, 
whereas others begin a journey to self-destruction. 
Behaviors that are adaptive and help the individual to 
cope result in a greater understanding and acceptance of oneself. However, maladaptive self-protective re-
sponses, if not changed, can eventually lead to self-
destruction.  Figure 27-1   illustrates the continuum of 
self-protective responses.
Self-destructive behaviors are classiﬁed as direct or 
indirect.  Direct self-destructive behaviors are any form 
of active suicidal behavior, such as threats, gestures, or 
attempts to end one’s life. In this case, the individual 
intends to commit suicide. Although he or she may 
waver between wanting to live and longing to die, the 
behaviors communicate an active wish to die.
Many more people, however, engage in indirect 
self-destructive behaviors, which are more subtle 
responses to self-protection.  Indirect self-destructive 
behaviors  are described as any behaviors or actions that 
may result in harm to the individual’s well-being or 
death. In this case, people have no actual intention of 
ending their lives. They may be unaware of the poten-
tial for self-harm when engaging in harmful activities 
and deny the possibility of danger when confronted. 
Examples of indirect self-destructive behaviors in-
clude substance abuse, engaging in inappropriate or 
dangerous activities, and an unwillingness to change 
negative thoughts and actions. Because many of these 
behaviors are legal or socially accepted, people do not 
realize their potential for harm.
As the continuum of self-protective responses (see 
Figure 27-1 ) moves more toward maladaptive behaviors, 
2 Clients with Psychosocial Problems
 
 indirect self-destructive behaviors progress to active 
attempts to injure oneself.  Self-injuries reaf ﬁrm to indi -
viduals that they are still alive. Pain serves as a reminder 
of their connection with the body and its physical world. 
The last and ultimate maladaptive self-protective re -
sponse is suicide. Suicide is a complex and emotional 
issue, but it is one with which health care providers 
must cope. Although overt suicidal attempts receive the 
most attention, individuals who engage in indirect self-
destructive behaviors carry risks as great as those indi -
viduals who actually attempt to end their lives.
   MYTHS ABOUT SUICIDE
Many half-truths and misconceptions about suicide 
continue to exist despite educational efforts to pro -
mote accurate understanding. Although suicide has 
always been present in a society, little effort was 
made to understand its nature until the beginning of 
the twentieth century. Today many false ideas about 
suicide still exist.  Table 27-1     explains several of these 
myths and offers facts to more accurately re ﬂect the 
nature of suicide.IMPACT OF SUICIDE ON SOCIETY
 
 More than 3000 suicides occur throughout the world 
every day. Worldwide, suicide “causes more deaths 
every year than homicide or war” ( ASHA , 2011). Sui -
cide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United 
States and the seventh leading cause of death in males 
15 to 24 ( NIMH , 2011). For every successful suicide, 
there are 11 people who attempt suicide.
Sadly the suicide rate for children ages 10 to 14 
has doubled since 1980. Twenty percent of all suicides 
occur in white men older than 65 years. The true num -
ber of persons who end their own lives is unknown 
because many motor vehicle accidents and other mis -
haps are actually intentions to commit suicide. For 
this reason it is important for nurses and other health 
care providers to be well versed in recognizing and 
intervening with clients who are suicidal.

  N o  o n e  k n o w s  e x a c t l y  w h y  a  p e r s o n  c h o o s e s  s u i c i d e ,  b u t  
many cultural, social, and individual factors have an 
inﬂuence. The laws, customs, beliefs, values, and norms 
of a culture usually include a view of suicide. In some 
cultures, such as ancient Japan, suicide is considered an 
honorable atonement for transgressions committed dur -
ing one’s life. When a pharaoh king of Egypt died, it was 
an expected custom for the widow(s) to commit suicide 
and join him on his journey across the heavens.
Religious beliefs and customs have an impact on 
the incidence of suicide. Some Christian faiths, for 
example, forbid suicide under any circumstances, CONTINUUM OF SELF-PROTECTIVE RESPONSES

 whereas the taking of one’s life may be justi ﬁed in the 
beliefs of other religious groups.
Customs and rituals may play a role in suicide. The 
“evil eye” or voodoo practiced by Caribbean islanders 
is very real for the victim of the curse. In these societies, 
suicide is not a surprising outcome for an individual 
who has been hexed or cursed.

Organization’s statistics on suicide. Since 1993, with 
their cultural upheaval, Russia and the Baltic republics 
have surpassed Hungary in the number of suicides. 
Providers of health care must remember that people 
hold strongly to their cultural beliefs and practices. An 
awareness of a cultural group’s attitude about suicide 
may someday help prevent a suicide. owning a handgun is illegal. According to the  U.S. 
Census Bureau (2006), the suicide rate for England and 
Wales was 6.7 people per 100,000. In the United States, 
in which gun ownership is hotly debated and de -
fended, the rate is 31.3 suicides per 100,000 persons.

tion. In Hungary, for example, villages dwindle as their residents 
choose suicide over the uncertainty of living an isolated, lonely 
life. When people in Hungary “get fed up, they hang themselves, 
cut their wrists, or swallow pesticides, just like their fathers and 
grandfathers did,” states Dr. Jorge Ulloa, a psychiatrist who runs 
a suicide clinic near Budapest.   Cultural Considerations
   
 
       SOCIAL FACTORS
  M a n y  s o c i a l  i n ﬂuences affect the incidence of suicide. 
Chief among them is a sense of  social isolation felt by mem -
bers of fast-paced, goal-oriented societies. Family and 
community support systems have dwindled as mobility, 
politics, and ﬁnances shift people away from the safety 
and security of family and friends. The support of kind 
neighbors and friends has been replaced by the generic, 
ready-made support of massive and complicated govern -
mental systems. Crime and other aggressive actions force 
people to mistrust the intentions of others and barricade 
themselves behind locked doors and secured communi -
ties, but the price of security is paid with isolation and its 
ensuing sense of hopelessness.
An inability to meet basic needs has a strong in ﬂu-
ence on the occurrence of suicide. Since the emptying 
of state psychiatric hospitals, the number of homeless 
people has swelled. It is now estimated that persons 
with mental illnesses make up more than one third of 
the homeless population. The risk for suicide, for both 
healthy and mentally troubled individuals, skyrockets 
when one is unable to meet food, shelter, and clothing 
needs. Poverty and homelessness lead to depression 
and hopelessness. Suicide becomes an acceptable alter -
native when one is continually hungry, cold, ill, or 
living in fear.
  T h e  a v a i l a b i l i t y  o f  w e a p o n s ,  e s p e c i a l l y  ﬁrearms, is a 
signi ﬁcant factor in relation to suicide. In countries in 
which the ownership of guns is prohibited, suicide 
rates are lower. To illustrate, in the United Kingdom,    S t a t i s t i c s  s h o w  t h a t  g u n - r e l a t e d  i n j u r i e s  a n d  d e a t h s  i n  t h e

as age, in ﬁrmity, and illness take their toll.
The appearance of human immunode ﬁciency virus 
(HIV) and acquired immunode ﬁciency syndrome 
(AIDS) has had a profound in ﬂuence on the suicide 
rates in many countries. In the United States, the 
death-with-dignity philosophy has in ﬂuenced many 
AIDS sufferers to choose the time and place of their 
passing. This form of suicide is called  rational suicide 
because the choice to end one’s life was made freely 
and rationally with a sound mind.
Other social factors play a role in suicides. Higher 
suicide rates are seen in survivors of natural disasters 
or severe acts of aggression, such as ethnic cleansing. 
Veterans of combat ( Figure 27-2   ) and those with post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffer higher suicide

DYNAMICS OF SUICIDE
 
 
 
 The act of attempting suicide has a profound impact 
on the lives of individuals, families, friends, and com -
munities. When many suicides occur, a whole society 
becomes affected. Because human beings dynamically 
function in several realms or dimensions at any given 
time, it is important to consider suicide from a holistic 
point of view.
   C H A R A C T E R I S T I C S  O F  S U I C I D E
Suicide is an act of  individual meaning. The actual 
reasons for choosing such a ﬁnal course of action are 
never known to anyone but the individual. However, it 
is likely that more than one motive drives a person to 
suicide.
  I n  t h e   physical  dimension, thoughts of suicide pro -
duce many of the same biochemical changes in the body 
as depression. Chronic fatigue and vague complaints are 
common in both depressed and suicidal individuals. 
Often suicidal persons will not eat, drink, or rest enough 
to maintain required energy levels. Recent studies have 
suggested a link between low serum cholesterol levels 
and suicide attempts in men. Methods of choice for com -
mitting suicide differ by gender. Men prefer to rely on 
ﬁrearms, hanging, or drowning, whereas women prefer 
to overdose with pills or inhale carbon monoxide.
  T h e   emotional  dimension of functioning for the 
suicidal person is ﬁlled with feelings of ambivalence, 
anger, aggression, guilt, helplessness, and hopelessness.
   A m b i v a l e n c e  is a state in which an individual 
experiences con ﬂicting feelings, attitudes, or drives. 
For the suicidal person, the struggle is between self-
preservation (life) and self-destruction (death). Often 
suicidal individuals threaten or attempt suicide and 
then behaviorally act out their feelings of ambivalence 
by seeking treatment.
 A n g e r  a n d  a g g r e s s i o n  a r e  t u r n e d  i n w a r d  i n  s u i c i d a l  
persons. Fears of being abandoned or rejected add to 
the dynamics. Many persons who feel trapped in frus -
trating relationships commonly react with rage that 
becomes self-directed and harmful.
Guilt can also lead to suicide. Suicidal individuals 
often shoulder the guilt of the world. They feel sinful 
and carry around the belief that they must have done 
something very wrong to deserve their misfortunes. 
Often personal guilt is exaggerated until the only way  
 to make up for one’s transgressions is to offer the ﬁnal 
sacri ﬁce—the self.
 F o r  t h e  s u i c i d a l  i n d i v i d u a l ,  t h e  e m o t i o n a l  d i m e n s i o n  
is marked by overwhelming feelings of helplessness 
and hopelessness. Nothing works out the way it was 
expected. The individual becomes unable to function 
emotionally. Life is bleak and hopeless as its meaning 
and purpose slip from one’s control. Self-esteem sinks 
to an all-time low.
  I n  t h e   intellectual  dimension, intense emotional 
suffering leads to distorted thinking and self-defeating 
thoughts. The self becomes devalued and worth little. 
Everything is glum and depressing, which leads indi -
viduals to a negative and pessimistic view of the future. 
One’s self-talk becomes self-defeating, which soon leads 
to negative behaviors. Thinking is self-centered rather 
than oriented toward solving problems. Why continue 
when the future looks so bleak?
  T h e   social dimension of functioning includes one’s 
views of others. Many suicidal individuals depend on the 
frequent feedback of others to reaf ﬁrm their self-worth. 
Self-esteem is very low in suicidal people. Their feelings 
of inferiority, of being less than others are, interfere with 
social relationships and lead to the isolation and loneli -
ness that accompany suicide.
In the last area, the  spiritual  dimension, suicidal 
individuals grapple with the cultural, religious, and 
ethical dilemmas associated with one’s own demise. 
Many respond by blaming other people, their society, 
or their religious practices. Others “make their peace” 
with the spiritual sides of themselves and experience a 
spiritual calm and serenity before committing suicide. 
Some people believe they will be reunited with loved 
ones in a new life after leaving this reality.
      
 
 CATEGORIES OF MOTIVATION
People are motivated to take their own lives for many 
reasons. All suicide victims, however, seem to share 
two major viewpoints. The ﬁrst is a deep, inner distur -
bance of hopelessness, despair, poor self-esteem, and 
feelings of being trapped. The other is described as a 
logic whereby suicidal individuals consider the act as 
a way of relieving themselves of the miseries of this 
life and connecting with a sense of immortality or a life 
beyond the one they are leaving behind.
 T h e r e  a r e  s e v e r a l  c a t e g o r i e s  o f  m o t i v a t i o n  f o r  s u i c i d e

wish to live and the need to die. They feel trapped in a 
situation from which they see no other escape. Killing 
oneself is an effort to break out and take control, to 
do something about one’s life. These individuals are 
communicating their need for the kind of help that 
will radically change their lives and alter their present 
existence. The following  Case Study  illustrates this type 
of motivation.well and the future is bright may be searching for that 
fulﬁllment.
The fourth motive for suicidal behavior is to relieve 
distress related to situations that threaten the intact -
ness of a person. The 70-year-old businessman with 
prostate cancer who chooses suicide over potentially 
life-prolonging surgery is an example of this type of 
motivation.
Last are those individuals who are preoccupied 
with suicide. They derive comfort knowing that they 
will control the time and circumstances of their death. 
These people are usually unwilling to accept life on 
any terms but their own. They set conditions for living 
and refuse to continue with life unless it is on their 
terms. Often suicide is the only form of real control 
they feel they have.
When working with suicidal clients, remember that 
no matter what the motivation, each individual is 
experiencing deep discomfort and very low self-esteem. 
Compassion and understanding become valuable 
therapeutic tools when working with suicidal clients.
THEORIES ABOUT SUICIDE
 
 
 Suicide is an end result. It is dif ﬁcult to understand all 
the factors that lead up to one’s decision to end his or 
her life. The study of the nature of suicide is called 
suicidology . Several theories attempt to explain the 
causes of suicidal behavior.
  T h e   psychoanalytical theory states that all humans 
have the instinct for life and death within them. Suicidal 
persons experience much ambivalence between want -
ing to live and wanting to die. Anger turns inward, and 
when stressful life events activate their death wish, 
suicide becomes an option.
   S o c i o l o g i c a l   theory considers the relationship 
between the number of suicides and the social condi -
tions of an area. These theorists believe that suicide 
rates are affected by group support (or the lack of it), 
social changes, regulations, religion, legal sanctions 
or limitations, and philosophical beliefs. In short the 
sociological theories consider the impact of social 
factors on the occurrence of suicide.
Last is the  interpersonal  theory, developed by 
H.S. Sullivan. Suicide is viewed as the outcome of a 
failure to work with or resolve interpersonal con ﬂicts.
These three theories form much of the foundation 
for further studies into the nature of suicide. However, 
ongoing research into the psychobiological nature of 
the human being is revealing new information about 
suicide and its motivations.

      The second motive for considering suicide is the 
refusal to accept a diminished quality, style, or pace of 
life. This motive causes persons to commit rational 
suicide. They assess their situation in a clear and un -
emotional manner, consider all the options, and then 
decide to take steps that will end their lives. Decisions 
and plans are made logically with little or no emotion. 
The decision to commit suicide is seen as a logical one. 
An example would be the 80-year-old man who kills 
his 78-year-old blind and bedridden wife and then 
ends his own life after making all the arrangements for

values more important than life. Suicide is a way of

 Anxiety and depression are often the forerunners of 
suicidal thoughts. Researchers have demonstrated that 
when certain chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters) 
are not in balance, people have dif ﬁculty regulating their 
moods. For example, irregularities in a certain neu -
rotransmitter pattern, called the  serotonin system,  have 
been found in depressed and suicidal persons. These 
ﬁndings have implications for health care providers. As 
our understanding of the dynamics of suicide grows, so 
does our ability to recognize the potential for suicide 
and effectively intervene.
   EFFECTS OF SUICIDE ON OTHERS
Suicide, like natural death, has a strong effect on those 
left behind. Following a suicide, the lives of the survi -
vors can be ﬁlled with questions, anger, sadness, shame, 
guilt, and health problems. “The death of a spouse by 
suicide has the potential of severely compromising 
the psychological well-being of the surviving marital 
partner” ( Constantino   and others, 2002). The grieving 
process is further complicated by social attitudes about 
taking one’s own life.
   S u r v i v o r  G u i l t
The loss of a loved one through suicide is considered a 
much more stressful event than the grief reaction to a 
natural death. Guilt is a main response because survivors 
often think they could have done something to prevent 
the suicide. Guilt may also stem from unexpressed anger 
toward the deceased person for abandoning family and 
friends. Depression, PTSD with ﬂashbacks, and somatic 
complaints are the common problems of most suicide 
survivors. Impaired immune system functioning may 
accompany the emotional disturbances.
   A n g e r   may be expressed as “agonized questioning” 
that helps the survivors cope with their emotional 
turmoil and disorganization. Some may hide their 
resentment, anger, and rage, turning it into depression. 
Children often feel responsible for the suicide. Unless 
they receive much love, support, guidance, and per -
mission to be angry, depression or other behavioral 
problems may develop.
Socially the stigma of suicide is soon felt. Forced in -
teractions with health care providers, the police, or the 
media soon after death can bring home the feelings of 
rejection that are often experienced by the family mem -
bers of suicide victims. Friends and relatives, unsure of 
how to help, withdraw or do nothing. This reaction 
limits the social contact and support that are so needed 
after the suicide of a loved one. The survivors of a sui -
cide victim may also withdraw from social interactions 
to protect themselves from the gossip and intrusion 
of inconsiderate others. Thus begins a cycle of guilt, 
withdrawal, and blame between the survivors of a 
suicide and others in their world. With support and understanding, survivors eventually recover and accept 
the fact that the responsibility for the suicide rests with 
the individual who committed it and not with those 
who are left behind.
  H e a l t h  c a r e  p r o v i d e r s  a r e  n o t  i m m u n e  t o  t h e  e f f e c t s  o f  
suicide. When a client, especially an inpatient, commits 
suicide, staff members and other clients may experience 
guilt, anger, or helplessness. Both clients and staff mem -
bers need to grieve and express the emotions that follow 
a suicide. Often other clients on the unit will express 
anger at the staff, act out, or become self-destructive. 
Sharing emotions about the suicide allows both staff and 
clients the opportunity to express themselves and cope 
with the experience. The survivors of suicide, no matter 
who they are, must grieve and learn to heal.
SUICIDE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE
 
 
   Attempts to end one’s life occur in every age group. 
Although the motivations for suicide may vary with 
the developmental level, the effort to die remains the 
same. Understanding how suicide is used at different 
developmental levels is important. Recognition and 
treatment of the problems underlying suicidal behav -
iors are much more effective when begun early.
   S U I C I D E  A N D  C H I L D R E N
Although depression is usually a component of 
suicide, with children it may be different. Some ex -
perts believe that suicide in children is most often the 
result of family con ﬂict or disruption. Children learn 
by exposure. The children of depressed mothers think 
about and attempt suicide more often than those 
of emotionally healthy mothers. Children commit 
suicide as a cry for help, to change their situations, or 
to act out a sincere wish to die. Children with existing 
mental health problems, such as conduct disorders, 
attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorders, or psycho -
ses, are at a greater risk for committing suicide than 
other children. Because they are impulsive, suicides in 
children are usually not planned. Often the loss of a 
parent triggers suicidal behaviors in children who 
were not encouraged to grieve. Because very young 
children cannot understand the concept of death as a 
permanent state, their wishes to join their lost parent 
may lead to suicidal behaviors.
  T h e   key  to recognizing the signs of suicidal intent 
lies in  a change in the child’s behavior. Any child 
whose attitudes, behaviors, or habits change dramati -
cally in a short time, especially following a stressful 
event or situation, is a candidate for suicide.

The rate of adolescent suicide has risen dramatically 
in the past 30 years. The suicide rates for adolescents 
and young adults have tripled in the last four decades. 
Today suicide is the third leading cause of death in 
 Inward-Focused Emotions: Suicide 7
 
   15- to 24-year-olds ( NIMH , 2011). Young men are the 
most affected by violence and suicide in adolescence. 
Statistics may not accurately re ﬂect the actual number 
of adolescent suicides because many suicidal deaths 
are listed as accidental.
During adolescence, any long-standing family or 
social problems may continue to worsen as the dif ﬁ-
culties of growing up are experienced. If coping skills 
or resources are insuf ﬁcient, adolescents, especially 
those with low self-esteem, may consider suicide as an 
option for solving their problems. Adolescents commit 
suicide when they feel there is no other way out of 
their problems. They see their problems as genuinely 
unsolvable, now or in the future.
Many factors come into play in adolescent suicide. 
Depression, poor impulse control, and emotional 
isolation are related to suicide in adolescents. Dysfunc -
tional or disrupted family interactions, such as divorce 
or separation of parents, can devastate many teens. 
Adolescents with anorexia nervosa have higher rates 
of suicide. In fact many theorists believe that anorexia 
is a slow attempt at suicide.
Social problems with peers, the use of drugs or 
alcohol, and a lack of consistent relationships also add 
to the risk for suicide. When the environment lacks 
security or presents dangers, many teens feel that 
their lives will be short and that they will not live 
until adulthood. The outlook for the future holds little 
promise with this attitude.
The incidence of suicidal behaviors is also increased 
in children and adolescents who suffer from chronic 
disease. Children and adolescents with immune-
mediated (type 1) diabetes, for example, have a higher 
risk for suicide than healthy individuals. Those diabetics 
who actually try to commit suicide often do so by some 
method relating to their diabetes, such as overdosing on 
insulin. Health care providers should routinely assess 
every client (including those with medical diagnoses or 
problems) for the presence of suicidal thoughts. Become 
aware of the risk factors that can play an important role 
in an individual’s choice to commit suicide ( Box 27-2   ).

Suicide is a signi ﬁcant problem in adulthood, espe -
cially for white men. Women attempt suicide three 
times more frequently than men, but men are more 
successful at completing the act. In 25- to 34-year-old 
men, suicide ranks as the second leading cause of 
death ( U.S. Census Bureau , 2006).
In young adults suicide occurs when individuals 
are unable to cope with the pressures of adulthood. 
Some experience problems with interpersonal rela -
tionships, whereas others lack personal resources and 
are poor, hungry, or unemployed. All, however, are 
dissatis ﬁed with their lives.
Loneliness is a factor in adult suicides. The loss of a 
family member or signi ﬁcant relationship, whether  
   
 through divorce or death, increases the risk for suicide. 
In addition certain professions and occupations are 
associated with higher rates of suicide.

if they ever think about suicide. The answer to that 
question may offer an opportunity to help save an 
individual’s life.

As age increases, so does the rate of suicide. Many 
studies reveal that the incidence of suicide increases 
with age. The actual number is dif ﬁcult to determine 
because only active suicides are counted. Many older 
adults choose to commit a  passive suicide by refusing 
to eat, drink, or cooperate with care.
The causes and risk factors of suicide in elderly 
people are poorly understood. Although many elderly 
individuals who commit suicide have had contact 
with a health care professional within the month 
before their deaths, their risk was not identi ﬁed or 
treated.
Older adults tend not to communicate their inten -
tions unless directly asked; thus, suicidal attempts in 
older adults are more successful. One out of every two 
suicide attempts in the elderly population results in 
death. These sobering statements must alert every care 
provider to perform a suicidal risk assessment for all 
older adults.

8 Clients with Psychosocial Problems
 population ( Stanhope   and Lancaster, 2008). Risk fac -
tors for suicide in elderly people are advanced age, 
male gender, low socioeconomic status, chronic pain 
or illness, and fear of becoming dependent or helpless. 
A lack of relationships appears to be a driving force 
behind many suicides. Other researchers believe that 
intolerable life circumstances are the main motives for 
suicides in the elderly population.
Social attitudes about elder suicide differ. Some 
people think that all suicides in elderly people are 
irrational decisions, based on depression or physical ill -
ness. They believe aggressive interventions are always 
required. Others view elder suicide as the last rational 
decision, the last act of control over one’s life.
The concept of rational suicide in the United States is 
“at odds with the legal system,” but in other countries, 
such as the Netherlands, suicide is an acceptable way 
to achieve “death with dignity.” It may seem that the 
important questions and issues surrounding the control 
of one’s own death are issues for philosophers and 
medical ethicists. However, health care providers will be 
addressing many of these questions in daily practice.

focused emotions. Behaviors such as repeated  cutting 
and  scratching produce the pain that reminds many 
mentally troubled individuals that they are still alive.
THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS
Thoughts about suicide can be described on several 
levels.  Table 27-2   explains each level.
Suicide is a serious and preventable public health 
threat. Prevention is the most important health care 
action for all our clients, especially for those who may 
be suicidal. Preventing a suicide from occurring means 
saving a life; therefore, assessment is essential. Preven -
tion requires knowledge of the dynamics of suicide  
 and the ability to recognize the potential for suicidal 
actions in every client. The nursing (therapeutic) pro -
cess is an excellent tool for working with clients who 
may be considering suicide.
   A S S E S S M E N T  O F  S U I C I D A L  P O T E N T I A L
Because suicide is becoming so prevalent, it is impor -
tant to evaluate  every  client for its potential. To accom -
plish this ﬁrst assess the  risk factors for the age of the 
client. Then  ask  the client directly if he or she has any 
thoughts relating to suicide. Asking clients will not 
encourage them to take any suicidal actions. On the 
contrary it gives them permission to discuss their feel -
ings and attitudes.  Box 27-3   offers a list of questions 
for assessing suicidal intentions. Not every question 
may be appropriate for every client, but a series of 
questions such as these will usually bring out expres -
sions of suicidal thoughts if they are present.
Hospitalization may be required for the client’s 
safety and protection if he or she feels unable to con -
trol suicidal behaviors. Suicidal intentions can exist 
with any medical or psychiatric diagnosis. Clients who 
are depressed must be carefully monitored for expres -
sions of hopelessness.  Table 27-3    lists the basic compo -
nents of a suicide assessment. Do not hesitate to use 
this data-gathering tool whenever problems with the 
client’s emotional state are suspected.

Sometimes something as simple as discontinuing or 
changing a medication can lift spirits and decrease 
suicidal thoughts.

CLIENTS
  T h e  ﬁrst priority for the care of suicidal clients is 
protection  from harm. The client must be physically 
prevented from actively attempting suicide. If the 
risks are so high that a serious attempt may be made, 
suicide precautions  are implemented. These precau -
tions are standard interventions to prevent a suicide 
attempt from occurring. They are listed in  Box 27-5   . 
Clients with strong suicidal intents may require 
constant observation. Constant observation is a staff 
member keeping the client “in full view at all times” 
( Billings , 2001).

10 Clients with Psychosocial Problems
 One of the most important therapeutic interventions 
(after ensuring safety) with suicidal persons is to estab -
lish rapport with the client. Many suicidal people are 
alone. Most have little self-esteem. These individuals 
are distressed and experiencing enormous emotional 
reactions, but they will usually agree to make a  no self-
harm contract (a promise not to engage in self-destructive 
behaviors) with their caregivers ( Stuart , 2009). Close ob -
servation is still required even though the client has 
agreed with the contract. Establishing a therapeutic rela -
tionship with a health care provider is important for 
clients. The focused communications and concerned 
actions of caregivers help suicidal individuals to feel

Suicide and its associated effects are problems in 
today’s society. Many of us will be or have been 
touched by the suicide of a loved one or friend. It is 
our duty and responsibility as health care providers to 
protect our clients, even from themselves, when we 
must. Hopefully through our efforts, the tide of sense -
less loss of life can be turned, and choices will be made 
looking toward life instead of away from it.

Key Points
   Suicide is the action of intentionally taking one’s own life.
   Many misconceptions about suicide continue to exist
despite efforts to promote an accurate understanding of
the problem.
   Many cultural, social, and individual factors inﬂuence the
occurrence of suicide.
   The act of suicide has a profound impact on the lives of
individuals, families, friends, and communities.
   Thoughts and actions directed at self-destruction affect
every dimension of human functioning.
   There are several categories of motivation for suicide,
including a cry for help, a refusal to accept a diminished
quality of life, a need to afﬁrm one’s soul, an attempt to
relieve the distress related to situations that threaten the
intactness of a person, and an act of those who are
preoccupied with suicide.
   Theories that attempt to explain the causes of suicidal
behavior include the psychoanalytical theory, sociological
theory, and interpersonal theory.
   New connections between physical and behavioral
activities are being rapidly discovered.
   After the suicide of a loved one, the lives of the survivors
can be plagued with anger, sadness, shame, guilt, health
problems, and agonizing questions.
   Some experts believe that suicide in children is most
often the result of family conﬂict or disruption.
   Adolescents commit suicide when they feel there is no
other way out of their problems.
   Adult women attempt suicide three times more frequently
than men, but men are more successful at completing
the act.
   The incidence of suicide in older adults continues to
increase with age.
   Prevention is the most important therapeutic action for
clients who may be suicidal.
   Because suicide is becoming so prevalent, it is important
for nurses to assess every client for its potential.
   The ﬁrst priority for the care of clients who may be suicidal
is protection from harm.
   With encouragement and the advocacy of their care
providers, many suicidal clients are able to develop
effective strategies for living more satisfying lives.Review Questions for the NCLEX® Examination

is a(n):
   1 .   Middle-aged married man
     2 .   Young African-American man who lives alone
     3 .   Elderly white man who is the last survivor of four
siblings
     4 .   High school freshman who is 30 pounds overweight
2.   Because of the emotions attached to a suicidal act,
the loss of a loved one through suicide compares
with the grief reaction of a natural death in that
it is ____ stressful.
   1 .   Less
     2 .   Just as
     3 .   Much more
     4 .   Not at all

ABSTRACT 
Objective: To assess the efficacy of chiro- 
practic spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) in 
the treaunent of migraine. 
Design: A randomized controlled trial of 6 
months' duration. The trial consisted of 3 
stages: 2 months of data collection (before 
treatment), 2 months of treatment, and a fur- 
ther 2 months of data collection (after trea 
meat). Comparison of outcomes to the initial b~

both an SMT group and a control group. 
Setting: CNropractic Research Center of Macquane University. 
Participants: One hundred twenty-seven volunteers between 
the ages of 10 and 70 years were recruited through media adver- 
tising. The diagnosis of migraine was made on the basis of the 
International Headache Society standard, with a minimum of at 
least one migraine per month. 
Interventions: Two months of chiropractic SMT (diversified 
technique) at vertebral fixations determined by the practitioner 
(maximum of 16 treatments). 
Main Outcome Measures: Participants completed standard 
headache diaries during the entire trial noting the frequency, 
intensity (visual analogue score), duration, disability, associated cmptoms, and use of medication for each 
migraine episode. 
Results: The average response of the treatment 
group (n = 83) showed statistically significant 
improvement in migraine frequency (P < 
.005), duration (P < .01L disability (P < .05), 
and medication use (P < .001) when compared 
with the control group (n = 40). Four persons 
failed to complete the trial because of a variety 
causes, including change in residence, a motor 
:le accident, and increased migraine frequency. 
gxpressed in other terms, 22% of participants reported 
more than a 90% reduction of migraines as a consequenc of the 
2 months of SMT. Approximately 50% more participants re- 
ported significant improvement in the morbidity of each episode. 
Conclusion The results of this study support previous results 
showing that some people report significant improvement in 
migraines after chiropractic SMT. A high percentage (>80%) of 
participants reported stress as a major factor for their migraines. 
It appears probable that chiropractic care has an effect on the 
physical conditions related to stress and that in these people the 
effects of the migraine are reduced. (J Manipulative Physiol

The Migraine Foundation of Australia estimates that some 
12% of Australians aged 15 years and over experience mi- 
graines. ~ However, the true number of subjects with mi- 
graines is unknown because not all such subjects visit a gen- 
eral practitioner. "~ A study performed in Australia estimated 
the cost of migraines to society as more than $750 million per 
annum. 3 T'ne estimated cost of migraines in the United States 
is over $17 billion (in US dollars) per annum. 4 
The Headache Classification Committee of the Interna- 
tional Headache Society (IHS) defines migraines as having 
the following qualities: unilateral location, pulsating quality, 
moderate or severe intensity, ~d being aggravated by routine 
physical activity. During the headache, th¢ person must also

ther by history, physical examination, or neurologic exami- 
nation, that the person has a headache listed ha groups 5 to 11

The aura is the feature that distinguishes migraines with 
aura from migraines without aura. An aura usually consists 
of homonymous visual disturbances; unP~ateral parethesias, 
numbness, or both; ur~ilateral weakness; a~hasia; or unetas- 
sifiable speech di~culty. 6 Some subjects with migraines 
have described the aura as an opaque object or a zigzag line 
around a cloud, and cases of tactile hallucinations have even 
been recorded. 7 The new terms migraine with aura and 
migraine without aura replace the old terms classic migraine 
and common migraine, respec~vely, s 
LHS diagnostic criteria for migraine with aura (category 
1.2) requires at least 3 of the following: (I) one or more Ii~ly 
reversible aura symptoms indicating focal cer~gbral cortex 
dysfunction, brainstem dysfianction, or boW; (2) at least 6ne 
aura symptom developing gradually over more than4 minutes 
or 2 or more symptoms occurring in su-,-essioa; (3) no aura 
symptom lastmg for more than 60 minutes; and (4).headache 
after aura, witha free interval of less than 60 minutes.

Recent pharmaceutic treatment for migraine has focused 
on the serotonergic system or antiemetic symptoms. These 
include sumatriptan (Imigran), ergotamine (Ergodryl), dihy- 
droergotamine (Dihydergot), or combinations of pharmaceu- 
ticals, such as caffeine and ergotamine (Cafergot). 8 Research 
on these pharmaceuticals suggest significant short-term re- 
lief but have not established any long-term benefit. 9-~5 For 
example, Winner 16 assessed results of subcutaneous dihydro- 
ergotamine mesylate (DHE-45) versus subcutaneous suma- 
triptan succinate (Imitrex) on a cohort of 295 patients with 
migraine. In 2 hours 73% of those receiving DHE-45 versus 
85% of those receiving sumatriptan succinate had relief from 
the migraine. However, 45% of the sumatriptan succinate 
group and 18% of the dihydroergotamine mesylate group had 
a recurrence of the migraine within 24 hours after treatment. 
Clinical observations suggest that migraines may be 
aggravated or potentially caused by cervical spine condi- 
tions. 17 Even though migraines related to cervicogenic con- 
ditions are clinically recognizable, the exact mechanisms are 
unknown. ~s-22 The role of the trigeminocervical nucleus in 
relation to migraine also remains unclear. The nucleus 
receives input from the upper 3 cervical spine segments, and 
therefore spinal problems may contribute to nerve facilita- 
tion. 23 One proposed mechanism for how chiopractic treat- 
ment could influence migraine is through alteration of the 
pain sensitivity of the central nervous system. 24 The trigemi- 
nal nucleus innervates the cranium, as well as many intracra- 
nial and extracranial blood vessels. 25 Afferents from the first 
3 cervical vertebrae nerve roots also innervate the dura 
mater, the scalp, and many suboccipital muscles. 22 This is a 
similar mechanism to regional pain syndromes, and it is also 
suggested as one mechanism for serotonin action.26.27 
The cervical spine has been reported to be involved in 
headache, dizziness, and other referred pain. 2°'24.28-31 
Surgical decompression of the C2 nerve root has also result- 
ed in reduction of nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and 
vomiting. 29 However, the term cervicogenic migraine has 
been used infrequently and with some controversy because 
some authors doubt that the cervical spine is a potential etio- 
logic factor for migraine. 23 Most subjects with migraine 
have numerous symptoms and therefore many potential 
diagnoses. 2,7.14.17,20,21,24,32 Some authors believe there is a 
continuum between migraine, tension-type headache, and 
cervicogenic headache. ~8a9 In addition, the precipitating or 
aggravating factors for headaches and migraines are often 
the same or similar. 5.~7,2°,21.33 
This article will assess the results of a randomized con- 
trolled trial for chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy 
(CSMT) in migraine treatment in regard to alteration in 
symptoms, clinical features, and morbidity. 
METHODS 
The study design followed that of a previously reported 
pilot study of chiropractic SMT in migraine treatment. 22 Sub- 
jects with migraine were recruited through radio and newspa- 
per advertisements in the Sydney region. Applicants com- 
pleted a detailed symptom questionnaire and were selected according to a minimum of 5 of the following indicators: in- 
ability to continue normal activities or the need to seek a quiet 
dark area; pain located around the temples; pain described as 
throbbing; associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, aura, 
photophobia, or phonophobia; migraine precipitated by 
weather changes; migraine aggravated by head or neck move- 
ments; previous diagnosis of migraine by a specialist; and a 
family history of migraine. Inclusion was also based on par- 
ticipants experiencing a minimum of one migraine a month. 
Exclusion was based on participants experiencing a daily 
migraine, with the initiating factor being trauma. Participants 
were also excluded from the study if there were contraindi- 
cations to SMT, such as meningitis or cerebral aneurysm. In 
addition, participants with temporal arteritis, benign in- 
tracranial hypertension, or space-occupying lesions were 
also excluded because of safety concerns. 
Participants completed diaries during the entire 6 months 
of the study, noting the frequency, intensity, duration, dis- 
ability, associated symptoms, and use of medication for each 
migraine episode. Participants were instructed on how to 
complete the diary, which contained a table and an instruc- 
tion sheet. Participants had to note the date of the migraine, 
an intensity score based on a visual analogue scale, the num- 
ber of hours the migraine lasted, and the time before they 
could return to normal activities. In addition, participants 
noted associated symptoms by using a letter abbreviation, 
and they noted the type and strength of medication for each 
migraine episode. The diaries used are a standard outcome 
measure for many previous headache-migraine studies. 
Participants were randomly allocated to either the experi- 
mental group (CSMT) or a control group. Allocation was 
based on the first letter of the participant's surname and was 
controlled by an impartial research assistant. Randomization 
was on a 2:1 basis because participants also acted as their own 
control subjects on the basis of the establishment of the 
prestudy baseline. The experimental group received 2 months 
of CSMT treatment, which consisted of chiropractic diversi- 
fied technique at vertebral fixations determined by the practi- 
tioner (maximum of 16 treatments). Chiropractic SMT is de- 
fined as a passive manual maneuver during which the 3-joint 
complex is carried beyond the normal physiologic range of 
movement without exceeding the boundaries of anatomic in- 
tegrity. 22 SMT diversified technique requires a dynamic force 
in a specific direction, usually with a short-amplitude, high- 
velocity, spinal-manipulative thrust on areas of vertebral sub- 
luxation determined by the physical exan2i.'nation. 
Chiropractic vertebral subluxation (CVS) for this study 
is defined as a limitation of intersegmental motion resulting 
in loss of joint-ligament springing (denoted as end feel or ac- 
cessory vertebral movement). In addition, the CVS can cause 
joint tenderness, muscle spasm, and nerve root irritation. 
Factors for assessing CVS on each treatment session 
included a clinical history, physical tests (range of motion, 
segmental springing, and intersegmental motion assess- 
ment), and other specialized chiropractic procedures. In 
addition, for safety reasons, several vascular investigations 
were performed where indicated, which included vertebral

The control group received detuned interferential therapy, 
which consisted of electrodes being placed on the patient 
with no current sent through the machine. Patient blinding 
was achieved by participants being informed that they may 
be randomly assigned to a control group that would receive 
a placebo (noneffective) treatment. Concurrently, the practi- 
tioners were blinded to previous treatment results, assign- 
ment of control procedures, and other outcome measures. 
Statistical analysis involved comparing the changes for 
the different outcome measurements of incidence, intensity, 
duration, disability, and medication use throughout the trial. 
Comparison of outcome measurements was made for the 
control group versus the treatment group by using a paired t 
test for each variable. A one-way analysis of variance was 
used to test for significant differences between baseline data 
and final outcome measures for the 2 groups. In addition, 
analysis of covariance was used to test for significant differ- 
ences between baseline data for the 2 groups. 
RESULTS 
One hundred twenty-seven volunteers between the ages 
of 18 and 70 years were recruited through media advertis- 
ing. Of the 127 participants who agreed to enter the study, 4 
participants failed to complete the entire trial: one because 
of alteration in work situation, one because of a fractured 
ankle, one because of soreness after SMT, and one after an 
increase of migraine caused by chiropractic SMT. Table 1 
gives the comparative statistics for both the treatment group 
(n = 83) and the control group (n = 40). 10 Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics

treatment, treatment, and posttreattnent group means. 
The percentage response for each of the diagnostic crite- 
ria of the IHS guidelines is detailed in Table 2. The highest 
responses were for photophobia (90%), nausea (89%), reac- 
tion to pain requiring the person to seek a quiet dark area 
(83%), phonophobia (73%), throbbing pain characteristic 
(65%), and parietotemporal pain location (63%). The IHS 
diagnostic criteria with the lowest responses were aura 
(33%) and migraine aggravated by head or neck movement 
(52%). A moderate number (44%) of subjects did not indi- 
cate aura as a feature; however, they described either 
homonymous visual changes or paresthesias. 
The average response of the treatment group (n = 83) 
showed statistically significant improvement in migraine 
frequency (P < .005), duration (P < .01), disability (P < .05), 
and medication use (P < .001) when compared with the con- 
trol group. Expressed in other terms, 22% (n = 18) of the 
treatment group reported a greater than 90% reduction of 
their migraines as a consequence of the 2 months of SMT. A 
further 49% (n = 41) reported significant improvement in the 
morbidity of each episode. A comparison of the CSMT 
group with the control group shows significant improvement 
in migraine frequency (Fig 1), duration (Fig 2), disability 
(Fig 3), and medication use (Fig 4). Only 5 (4.1%) partici- 
pants reported that their migraine episodes were worse after 
the 2 months of SMT, but this was not sustained at the 2- 
month, posttreatment, follow-up period. 
An additional finding was that 73 (59%) participants 
reported no neck pain as a consequence of the 2 months of 
SMT. Twenty-seven (22%) participants reported slight pain, 
16 (13%) participants reported mild pain, and I0 (8%) par- 
ticipants reported moderate pain. 
DISCUSSIOH 
The majority of participants had chronic migraines; on av- 
erage, they had experienced migraines for 18.1 years. How- 
ever, the results demonstrated a significant (P < .005) reduc- 
tion in migraine episodes and associated disability. The mean

number of migraines per month was reduced from 7.6 to 4.1 
episodes (Table 3). The greatest area for improvement was 
medication use (P < .001), for which participants were asked 
to note the use of medication for each episode. A significant 
number of participants recorded that their medication use 
had reduced to zero by the end of the 6-month trial. 
A 6-month study gives the results more validity than those 
of previous studies because one criticism of some of those 
studies was that the length of the trial was too short to allow 
for the cyclical nature of migraines. However, the study was 
limited in sample size and the fact that the trial was a prag- 
matic study that did not consider what aspects of chiropractic 
SMT had contributed to the improvement in the migraines. 
In addition, the study was limited because of the type of 
Control group; interferential does not mimic SMT. However, 
it could be argued that participants acted as their own form 
of control subjects because of the baseline (2 months) data 
collection, especially given the fact that this group consisted 
of subjects with chronic migraines. Perhaps a better control 
group would be a group undergoing sham SMT, in which PRE -TREAT TR.EATMF_NT POST-TREAT

participants receive a manipulative thrust into the cervi- 
cothoracic junction that was designed to be ineffective. 
A further limitation of this study, as with other studies of 
migraine or headache, was that there was substantial overlap 
in diagnosis and classification of migraines. The question- 
naire used for diagnosis in this study proved to have good 
reliability when compared with the number of participants 
that had previously received a diagnosis from a specialist. 
However, there is a strong suggestion that many subjects 
with headaches may have more than one type of head- 
ache. 17-19.21,24'32 An advantage of the design of this study is 
that regardless of an exact diagnosis of the migraine, self- 
reported improvement of outcome measures allows assess- 
ment of the validity of the therapy in question) 2 
This study also appears to confirm that there are a number 
of precipitating or aggravating factors involved in migraine 
episodes, and therefore a single treatment regimen may 
prove ineffective in the long term. 17,20-22 
CONCLUSION 
There have now been several studies demonstrating sig- 
nificant improvement in headaches or migraines after chiro- 
practic SMT. 17°22'30'36-39 Some of these studies were limited 
by lack of control subjects, poor control subjects, small sam- 
ple sizes, and other methodological flaws. However, the 
level of evidence is steadily increasing to the point where 
there is now seen to be a moderate level of efficacy for chiro- 
practic SMT in the treatment of headaches or migraines. 
A high percentage (83%) of participants in this study 
reported stress as a major factor for their migraines. It 
appears probable that chiropractic care has an effect on the 
physical "conditions related to stress and that in these people 
the effects of the migraine are reduced. However, further 
studies are required to assess how chiropractic SMT may 
have an effect on migraine morbidity. Another study current- 
ly being completed will assess the effect in other associated 
symptoms commonly experienced with migraines.

A further question that needs to be answered is how to assess 
the results of other forms of chiropractic SMT in the treatment 
of headaches or migraines. The results of this study appear to 
support previous results indicating that some people report sig- 
nificant improvement in migraines after chiropractic SMT. 
However, future studies may demonstrate that some specific 
forms of chiropractic SMT do not achieve the same results.

1Cultural Competency 204
The study of cultural issues has a long history in the field of anthropology.
In the early 1970s, scholars Madeleine Leininger, an anthropologist and nurse
theorist, and Arthur Kleinman, a psychiatrist and medical anthropologist, identi-fied the need to integrate aspects of anthropology into health care, specificallynursing and medical practice. Leininger (1991) proposed the Theory of CultureCare Diversity and Universality and launched the field of transcultural nursing.Kleinman, Eisenberg, and Good (1978) highlighted the limitations of thebiomedical model of traditional Western clinical practice (which is based on the
biological and physiological sciences), making a case for applying social scienceto medical practice, and argued for the need to focus on the illness experience ofthe client. Since then, much has been written about the need for recognizing andaddressing the importance of cultural issues in health care.
The purpose of this course is to di scuss the rol e that culture plays in health, 
illness, and healthcare delivery. The course begi ns with a di scussion of the need 
for cultural competence based on d emographics and evidence of he alth dispari-
ties and health inequities in selected populations. An under standing of cul tural 
competence requires familiarity with rel ated terms su ch as “culture,” “race,” 
“ethnicity,” “diversity,” and “minority.” As w e examine the def initions of 
cultural competence and the Cultura l Competence C ontinuum, t he complex 
nature of cultural competence becomes clear. The  course ends w ith a disc ussion 
about the levels of cultural competence and the implications for he althcare 
providers. 
The Role of Culture in Health Care 
Today, it is generally recognized that illness and health are inextricably linked to
cultural issues. The impact of culture on health care is significant: it influenceshow illness is perceived and experienced, what symptoms are reported, whatremedies are sought, and who is consulted in the process. However, the provincialhealth systems in Canada are largely built on a Western, biomedical model ofhealth beliefs and healthcare delivery (including who is considered to be a legit-imate provider of healthcare services); hence, it is difficult for healthcareproviders to understand and/or accommodate all ethnocultural health beliefs andexpectations (Kirmayer & Minas, 2000; Kleinman et al., 1978; Masi, 1988). 
The culture clash between the Canadian healthcare system—with its roots in
Western culture —and the individual client’ s values and beliefs, along with a
failure on the part of the healthcare provider to recognize diverse ways of express-ing distress, can lead to miscommunication, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate care(Beiser, 1985; Brach & Fraser, 2000; Burr, 2002; Flores, Abreu, Schwartz, & Hill,2000; Kagwa-Singer & Blackhall, 2001; US Department of Health and HumanServices, 2001). (For example, not recognizing that some Eastern cultures pres-ent psychological distress through physical symptoms can lead to an overtreat-ment of physical symptoms and a failure to recognize the root cause.) At the sametime, the way health and illness is viewed in various cultural situations can posea challenge to the biomedical model and the Western healthcare system. (Forinstance, in many cultures illness is seen as a sign from God and healing involvesnatural and spiritual connections as well as the use of plants and minerals.)Consequently, healthcare organizations struggle to provide culturally appropriate2 Foundation Stones
care to diverse communities, while communities struggle with issues related to
access and ability to receive appropriate health care (Beiser, 1985; Camphina-Bacote, 1995; Health Canada, 2003; Leininger, 1991; US Department of Healthand Human Services, 2001).
The healthcare system’ s initial approach to understanding culturally diverse
communities was to focus on learning about the cultural stranger, whose wayswere different from what was regarded as the mainstream norm. There was a desireto act in the client’ s best interest and also to minimize the problems associated withdifferent cultural beliefs and values. In other words, cultural issues were perceivedas a “problematic difference” (misconceptions and odd beliefs or practices), oftenviewed as an impediment to shared understanding and co-operation and regardedas belonging exclusively to clients (Kirmayer & Minas, 2000; Tripp-Reimer, Choi,Kelley, & Enslein, 2001). Cultural concerns were thus objectified and the health-care providers could distance themselves from the whole matter. Addressingcultural diversity in the healthcare system was perceived as nice, but nonessential.Cultural sensitivity was seen as icing on the cake (Lock & Bibeau, 1993). The factthat healthcare professionals assumed that the problem lay in the client, withoutquestioning their own values and assumptions, reveals both ethnocentrism andcultural bias. Ethnocentrism refers to the belief that one’ s own cultural values,
beliefs, and behaviours are the best, preferred, and most superior ways. Culturalbias, a closely related concept, refers to the view that the values and beliefs of aparticular culture must guide the situation or decisions (Leininger, 1995). To someextent, all individuals are ethnocentric and biased toward their own culture. We allhave a preference for our own way of doing things, believing that to be the bestway; however, problems arise when ethnocentrism and bias are so strong that weare unable to consider alternative viewpoints. Popper (1970) writes that “we are[all] prisoners caught in the framework of our theories . . .We tend to believe thatothers see the world as we do. And when we do acknowledge different perspec-tives, we normally form convenient notions about the differences that create littlemore than the illusion of understanding” (p. 52).
Over the years, there has been increasing recognition that cultural issues are
important in relation not only to the client but also to the healthcare provider andthe healthcare system. It is now widely acknowledged that cultural differencesinvolve a recognition of the personal and professional background of the healthcareprovider (Kirmayer & Minas, 2000; Leininger, 1991; US Department of Health andHuman Services, 2001), as well as the social context of practice in terms of the“relative power, social position, and interaction of the local worlds of clinician andpatient” (Kirmayer & Minas, 2000, p. 440). Cultural challenges arise from thedifferences between the client’ s and the healthcare provider’ s values, beliefs, andexpectations regarding health, illness, and treatment. It follows, therefore, thatstrategies to develop cultural competence should include learning about othercultures as well as examining our own values and beliefs regarding health, illness,and other issues relevant to healthcare practice. This idea can be extended further toinclude critical examination of professional knowledge, healthcare dialogue, andthe broader social, economic, professional, and political issues affecting healthcareprovider–client relations and access to care (Browne & Smye, 2002; Kirmayer &Minas, 2000; US Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). Understanding Cultural Competence in Health Care 3
The role of culture in health care can be summarized in these key messages
(US Department of Health and Human Services, 2001):
■Culture counts. It plays a pivotal role in health, illness, and both access to
and outcomes of healthcare services.
■Culture is a concept associated with clients as well as the healthcareproviders who treat them. 
The cultural attitudes of the healthcare providers and the larger healthcare systemaffect the diagnosis, treatment, and organization of services, and have a notice-able impact on the quality and effectiveness of healthcare services. 
Although the need for culturally sensitive and culturally appropriate health
care has long been recognized in Canada (Anderson, 1987; Beiser, 1990; OntarioMinistry of Health, 1991; Tripp-Reimer, Brink, & Saunders, 1984), two trendshave made this need increasingly urgent: 
1. The changing demographics of the country, with respect to clients as well
as the healthcare workforce, means that diversity is more visible and morefrequently encountered. 
2. An increasing amount of literature documents persistent and, in many
cases, widening gaps in health outcomes for various cultural groups (Brach& Fraser, 2000; Institute of Medicine, 2002; Rorie, Paine, & Barger, 1996). 
Thus, the need to address cultural competence in heath care has shifted away frombeing an “added” service to a necessary one. 
Changing Demographics 
Canadian society, by virtue of its First Peoples and immigration heritage, hasbeen described as a kaleidoscope of cultures, languages, and nationalities. On aper capita basis, Canada accepts more immigrants annually than any other coun-try in the world (Baeker, 2002). At the start of this century, statistics indicate,nearly 20 percent of the population in Canada was foreign born (StatisticsCanada, 2003). The 2001 census data also identified over 200 groups with respectto ethnic ancestry, clearly validating Canada’ s identity as a multicultural society. 
Although immigration has always been a part of Canada’ s heritage, the immi-
gration patterns have shifted dramatically in the past few decades. Before 1961,90 percent of the immigrants to Canada came from Europe and only 3 percent wereAsian born. In contrast, only 20 percent of the immigrants in the 1990s came fromEurope and 58 percent came from Asia and the Middle East (Statistics Canada,2003). Even among European immigrants, the source countries have shifted fromthe British Isles, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands to increasing numbers fromEastern European countries such as Poland, Romania, and the former SovietUnion. The shifting immigration and settlement patterns translate into consider-able diversity across the nation. As noted by Galloway (2003), the concentration ofnew Canadians in big cities creates different Canadas. In Regina, Saskatchewan,for example, residents are largely descended from the first wave of settlers(Europeans and Aboriginal), while in Richmond, British Columbia, visible minori-ties—primarily Chinese and South Asians—account for more than 60 percent of the population (Galloway, 2003). The new arrivals also add to the growing diversity between urban and rural Canada as the majority of new immig rants,4 Foundation Stones
nearly 94 percent, settle in metropolitan areas (Statistics Canada, 2003). Table 1-1
reflects the diversity across the nation with respect to ethnic ancestry.
While immigration plays a big role in the diversity of the Canadian landscape,
it is not the sole influence. In addition to ethnicity, diversity exists on the basis ofgender, sexual orientation, disability, social class, and many other variables. Therelationship between Aboriginal peoples and others in Canadian society is partic-ularly complex. It needs to be understood in historical context. Cultural clashes arenot limited to individuals from foreign lands; they can occur in regard to a widenumber of communities who are perceived as minorities or as having differingneeds and values. These include communities as wide-ranging as Aboriginalpeoples and people who are deaf, gay or bisexual, or physically challenged. 
Health Disparity 
Increasing recognition of issues such as health inequity and disparity has madethe need for cultural competence more compelling. Health inequity can be
defined as the presence of 
systematic disparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between
social groups who have different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage—thatis different positions in a social hierarchy. Inequities in health systematically put groups ofpeople who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of being poor,female, and/or members of a disenfranchised racial, ethnic, or religious group) at furtherdisadvantage with respect to their health.

Inequities in health care are a result of complex interactions between clients,
healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, and healthcare systems (King &
Wheeler, 2004).
Recently, a large body of literature has documented significant and stagger-
ing racial and ethnic disparities in both health care and health outcomes (Adelson,2005; Amin, Kuhle, & Fitzpatrick, 2003; Brach & Fraser, 2000; Geiger, 2001;Gerrish, 2000; Institute of Medicine, 2002; Kendall & Hatton, 2002; Long,Chang, Ibrahim, & Asch, 2004; Rorie et al., 1996; Smedley, Stith, & Nelson,2002). Health disparities can exist with respect to either health outcomes and
healthcare equality, or both. Disparities in healthcare outcomes refer to the differ-ential burden of diseases, death, and morbidity in ethnic and racial minoritygroups compared with that of non-minorities. Disparities in health care refer tothe lower-quality care provided to minority populations, even when access-relatedfactors are controlled (Smedley et al., 2002). Health inequities point to the under-lying causes of disparities, many of which are largely outside the typical domainof health. These include social, economic, cultural, and political inequities thatdirectly and indirectly contribute to the disproportionate burden of ill health andsocial suffering on selected populations (Adelson, 2005). 
While addressing health inequities may be beyond the scope of individual
healthcare practitioners, healthcare providers must recognize the individualeffects of inequity. Health disparities should be understood as social, political,and cultural inequities, rather than as cultural traits. In other words, when anillness is prevalent in a culture, neither the individual nor his or her cultural back-ground is the cause of illness; the broader social and political factors must beexamined and understood in order to address the disparities (Adelson, 2005). 
Health disparities are becoming a critical issue in health care around the
world. US research indicates that members of minority groups are less likely thanWhites to receive needed services, including medically necessary procedures.Further, these disparities exist in a number of disease areas, including cancer,cardiovascular disease, HIV , AIDS, diabetes, and mental illness, and are foundacross a range of procedures, including routine treatments for common healthproblems (Brach & Fraser, 2000; Institute of Medicine, 2002). Although theInstitute of Medicine studies are based on US health outcomes, evidence ofinequality and exclusion also exists in Britain (Mir & Tovey, 2002) and in Canada.In Canada, potential differences in quality of care for culturally diverse groupshave received less research attention, but the disparities are remarkably similar tothose reported in the United States, where variables such as income, age, geogra-phy, and insurance status were controlled (Villeneuve, 2002). There is alsocompelling evidence of the poorer health status of Aboriginal people (Adelson,2005; Health Canada, 2003). While immigrant populations are found to be health-ier on arrival than people born in Canada, the effect does not last. Immigrants aremore likely to develop tuberculosis during their first decade in Canada, and, overtheir total lifespan, some immigrant groups experience a particularly high risk forcardiovascular disease, obesity, and colon cancer (Beiser, 2005). In addition,research indicates that immigrant and refugee populations encounter difficultiesaccessing health services and that they underutilize mental health services as wellas such preventive services as cancer screening (Health Canada, 2003).6 Foundation Stones
Health disparities also have been noted in relation to gender, sexual orienta-
tion, and health literacy. Canadian women are more likely than their male coun-
terparts to suffer from chronic conditions, and the disparities are furtherconfigured by ethnicity and the potentially corresponding discrimination thatensues from it (Spitzer, 2005). Lower levels of health literacy also have been asso-ciated with lower health status and increased rates of hospitalization (Rootman &Ronson, 2005). Homosexual orientation has been linked to increased risk fordepression and suicide (Health Canada, 2003), as well as decreased usage ofpreventive services (Rorie et al., 1996). 
Understanding and providing culturally competent care is now seen as a
strategy to reduce health disparity and enhance the health outcomes of manycultural groups (Brach & Fraser, 2000; Canadian Nurses Association, 2004; King& Wheeler, 2004; Mir & Tovey, 2002). While disparities in health care arise froma broad range of factors at several levels—those of the client, the healthcareprovider, and the healthcare system—healthcare providers, “as the more powerfulactors in the clinical encounter” (King & Wheeler, 2004, p. 815), bear the mostresponsibility for disparities in healthcare quality.
Understanding Cultural Competence 
The need for cultural competence in health care is clearly recognized, but the termitself is poorly understood. The term cultural competence evolved from older
terms such as “cultural sensitivity,” “cultural awareness,” and “cultural skills.”Sensitivity and awareness refer to requirements on the part of the healthcareprofessional and imply a need for specific knowledge and skills (Smith, 1998).Cultural competence takes the concept one step further: it refers to the ability ofhealthcare providers to apply knowledge and skill appropriately in interactionswith clients. “Cultural” is the adjectival component of the term, while “compe-tence” refers to the performance aspect (Burchum, 2002). The next section willexplore the definitions of terms associated with cultural competence. 
Exploring the Concepts: Definitions and Meanings 
One of the greatest difficulties associated with developing cultural competence inhealth care has been a lack of clarity regarding the meaning of the terms “culture”and “cultural competence,” as well as related terms such as “diversity,” “minor-ity,” “ethnicity,” and “race.” Some discussions about culture use the terms“culture,” “race,” and “ethnicity” interchangeably, while others argue for greaterspecificity and advocate using terms such as “ethnocultural” and “ethnoracial.”The terms “diversity” and “minority” also are being used with increasingfrequency as alternative concepts that transcend culture, race, and ethnicity. Inorder to develop an understanding of a concept, we have to understand both thedefinition of the term and its associated meaning. Cultural competence requiresa basic understanding of core concepts such as culture, race, ethnicity, diversity,marginalization, and minority. Each of these concepts is examined briefly in thediscussion that follows. The intent is to present the meaning of the terms so thatreaders can compare and challenge their own assumptions and interpretations,while recognizing where meanings are basically similar or different.Understanding Cultural Competence in Health Care 7
Race
The American Heritage Stedman’ s Medical Dictionary defines the term race as a
“local geographic or global human population distinguished as a more or less
distinct group by genetically transmitted physical characteristics.” The physicalcharacteristics referred to are observable characteristics such as skin colour, hairtype, and body proportions. The physical attributes are then linked to social behav-iour and status (Holland & Hogg, 2001). Race has been used to denote superiorityand inferiority, and colour has been an important determinant in such classifica-tions. In societies dominated by White Caucasians, for example, Black peoplewere generally defined as inferior and White people viewed as superior andprogressive. However, whether race is a biological category or a social category isdebatable. Anthropologists such as Margaret Mead challenge the assumption ofrace as a culture, a scientific construct, or a brute fact. They argue that race hasbeen established mainly as a social category that groups people by skin pigmenta-tion or other physical characteristics such as hair type and body proportions(O’Bryne, 2004).
In recent years, the biological basis of race has come under increasing chal-
lenge. Children of mixed-race couples can have varying degrees of skin pigmen-tation and shared physical characteristics, yet share similarity in genetic makeupand social culture. With increasing numbers of White people with Black ancestryand Black people with White ancestry, the term “race” can no longer be used todescribe culture (Fernando, 2003). As a result, the term “ethnicity” has becomemore prevalent as a concept for categorization and a way of ascribing identity. 
Despite the fact that race is now considered to be more of a social or mental
construct than an objective biological fact (American Heritage Dictionaries, 2000),it continues to be used as a variable within the context of research. Such usage iscontroversial, though. Opponents argue that racial categorization is biologicallyoutdated and does not reflect biological variations. Furthermore, they argue thatthe concept is inconsistently applied and that the classification system itself maybe rooted in racist beliefs. Proponents argue that although the concept of ethnicity(often used to replace race) offers a broader contextual description, it does not8 Foundation Stones
CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN ACTION
What’s Your Take on These Terms?
What comes to mind when you hear the following terms: “race,” “ethnic-
ity,” “diversity,” and “culture”? Note the descriptors you think of as well asyour feelings or emotions. What were some of the feelings—fear, confu-
sion, frustration, anger, challenge, or excitement? Are there terms that you
are more comfortable with or have a preference for? What are they? Arethere related terms that you prefer? If so, what are they?
The first step toward developing cultural competence is to increase our
own awareness of what the various terms mean to us and the emotionsthey generate. As you compare your answers with those of a colleague,note the similarities and differences in your perspectives. 

denote basic inequities, racialized structures, and social practices. “If race is
allowed to take a back seat in favour of ethnicity, discriminatory practices could bemore easily overlooked and [researchers] become blind to the role racism plays inhealth care” (Kendall & Hatton, 2002, p. 24). North American literature on BlackAmericans and other people of colour indicates that race continues to be a greaterbarrier to improved health than social class, socio-economic status, and lifestylechoices. For example, African Americans are more likely than Whites to receiveinadequate treatment for pain, curative surgery for some cancers, referral to renaltransplant centres, and diagnostic evaluation for life-threatening coronary arterydisease—“findings that are more related to racial bias, however subtle and unin-tentional, than to social customs” (Kendall & Hatton 2002, p. 27) or genetics. 
Where race is used as an identifying variable, it is important to explore the
meaning and intention behind the term, in order to determine its utility andappropriateness.
Racism
The term racism has also come to mean many different things. Essentially, racism
results when preconceived, adverse judgement or opinion (prejudice) is formedon the basis of racial characteristics. The addition of power to racial prejudiceleads to the exclusion of groups of people (based on their race, colour, national-ity, ethnicity, or religion) from decision-making processes, leadership, andeconomic opportunities. The effect is to marginalize or exclude and oppress somepeople and to sustain advantages for those belonging to other social groups(Registered Nurses Association of Ontario [RNAO], 2002a).
Racism can take many forms. It is considered to be both an attitude and a
behaviour resulting from that attitude. While individual racism can be seen in theactions and attitudes of individuals, systemic or institutional racism is less visibleand manifests itself in organizational policies and practices. Cultural racism issubtler and forms the basis of both individual and systemic racism. Cultural
racism has been defined as “prejudice by those with power against another racial,
religious, or social group demeaning their culture, at times attempting to change it,substitute their own over another or eradicate it” (Y agniza, 2004). It is the valuesystem, embedded in society, that supports and allows discriminatory actions basedon perceptions of racial and/or cultural superiority and inferiority (RNAO, 2002a).The minority group culture is seen as flawed, primitive, and standing in the way ofprogress. Members of minority groups may be encouraged to turn their backs ontheir own cultures and to become absorbed by the majority culture (Y aginza, 2004).
Although overt forms of racism are easier to see and understand, systemic
racism is reproduced largely through routine and taken-for-granted practices andprocedures in everyday life. Everyday racism is a concept introduced by Essed
(2000) to highlight this particular meaning. The everyday injustices are reflectedin unconscious assumptions (such as believing that particular groups are lazy,promiscuous, or lack ambition) and practices that systematically exclude individ-uals from particular events or opportunities (Essed, 2000). The persistent injus-tices can be difficult to pinpoint and are thus hard to address, but the persistentnature of such events can have a negative impact on mental and physical health. Understanding Cultural Competence in Health Care 9
Reviews of research into the effects of racism on identity, health, and well-
being indicate that perceived racism jeopardizes the health of those who experi-
ence it and continues to compromise access to and effective use of publicinstitutions (Baker, 2001; Spitzer, 2005).
Marginalization
Hall, Stevens, and Meleis (1994) identified marginalization as a guiding conceptto understanding diversity. To marginalize people is to confine them to an outerlimit or edge (the margins), and thus view them as somehow different from thenorm. The social process of marginalization refers to the “process through
which persons are peripheralized on the basis of their identities, associations,experiences, and environments” (Hall et al., 1994, p. 25). Marginalization isclosely related to disadvantage through low income, culture, gender, ability, orgeography and can have harmful health effects. In Canada, references to margin-alized groups include members of visible minority communities, immigrants,refugees, Aboriginal peoples, the homeless, sexual minorities, and persons withphysical or mental disabilities (Beiser, 2005; Spitzer, 2005). Marginalized groupsalso are referred to as “vulnerable populations,” as they are more likely to beexposed to, or unprotected from, health-damaging environments and less likely toreceive appropriate care (Beiser, 2005; Hall et al., 1994).
Minority
The term minority means existing in proportionally smaller numbers; however,
this simplistic definition can be misleading. Within the healthcare context, minor-ity group status is associated with marginalized status, meaning that such groupshave limited access to opportunity, power, and resources including healthcareservices. Minority group status, then, is not about the mathematical percentage ofthe population; rather, it is about being disadvantaged, underprivileged, discrimi-nated against, exploited, or disempowered in the governing structures of the domi-nant society (American Academy of Nursing, 1995). Even in instances where theactual number of individuals with minority group status reaches 50 percent ormore of the population, they are still likely to experience systemic inequitieswithin the dominant social systems. Although minority group status can beconferred on the basis of any social characteristic, it most often refers to race,ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. 
Ethnicity
The term ethnicity also means different things to different people. The Oxford
Dictionary of Current English defines the term “ethnic” as an adjective used to
“denote origin by birth or descent” or “to refer to a social group having a commonnational or cultural tradition” (Thompson, 1998, p. 296). The traditional charac-teristics include kinship, family rituals, food preferences, special clothing, andparticular celebrations.10 Foundation Stones
Leininger (2002a) describes ethnicity as a term used to refer to the racial or
skin-colour identity of particular groups related to features based on national
origins. Fernando (2003) notes that the term “ethnicity” acknowledges the place ofhistory, language, and culture in the construction of identity. In Britain, ethnicityis taken to mean a mixture of cultural background and racial designation, thesignificance of each being variable (Fernando, 2003). Whereas race generallydenotes physical attributes, ethnicity is related to the common national and culturaltraditions, and is used to describe group identification with a particular country orheritage. Although shared ethnicity may reflect shared culture, the terms “ethni-city” and “culture” cannot be used interchangeably (Leininger, 2002a).
Diversity
Diversity is a broad term with multiple meanings. For some, the term simply
refers to differences or variations across individuals and social groups, while forothers, it represents differences that make a difference, usually with respect tounequal access to social, political, and economic power, as well as privilege andprestige (Rummens, 2004). In discussions about health care, then, diversity doesnot simply refer to difference but rather implies difference from the majority,which is assumed to be the norm. Diverse groups and communities, in thiscontext, refer to a marginalized status within society, and diversity initiativesbecome almost synonymous with protection of human rights, freedom fromdiscrimination, and social justice. The problem is not difference in itself, ratherthat individuals and groups that are considered “different” are more likely toencounter oppression and exclusion (Cooke, 1999). In Canada, equality rightswithin the federal Charter of Rights and Freedoms specifically prohibit discrim-
ination on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, ormental or physical disability (Department of Justice Canada, 1982). Most schol-ars further expand this definition to include other variables such as sexual orien-tation, immigration status, and language abilities (Bowen, 2004; Frusti, Niesen,& Campion, 2003; Green, Lopez, Wysocki, & Kepner, 2002). 
Diversity can be both visible and invisible (Clair, Beatty, & MacLean, 2005).
Visible diversity refers to characteristics such as race, age, ethnicity, physicalappearance, speech patterns, dialect, and gender. Invisible diversity characteris-tics usually include differences that may not be readily evident, such as sexualorientation, social class, religion, illness, national origin, and occupation. Thevisible or invisible nature of difference can have very real advantages and disad-vantages. Visible differences are always evident; thus, members of visible minori-ties have no choice in either concealing or revealing them. The fact that thedifferences are always present increases the risk of stereotyping, discrimination,and marginalization. Invisible differences, on the other hand, are not alwaysapparent, and those who bear invisible differences are continually faced with thechoice of whether or not to expose the differences. Clair et al. (2005) describe thisas a choice to pass (hide) or disclose (reveal) the difference. Some people believethat those with invisible or concealable differences are “better off ” because thestigma is based on the reaction of others; however, invisible differences createUnderstanding Cultural Competence in Health Care 11
their own challenges. Although the inconspicuousness may help avoid some prob-
lematic interactions and automatic judgements, the fact that the person is amember of a minority group often is unacknowledged and thus not taken intoconsideration. Invisible differences also can cause people to live double lives, asindividuals anticipate and manage risks associated with being stigmatized as aresult of revelations (Clair et al., 2005).
A broad view of diversity can be problematic. As the definition expands to
include “all kinds of difference,” the list becomes so long that it can becomeunmanageable and lose its impact (Cooke, 1999). Another challenge involvedwith associating all marginalized groups under the diversity umbrella is that theactual diversity within diverse groups can easily be overlooked. For example, inNorth America the terms visible minorities or “people of colour” collapse a
broad, heterogeneous group of non-White persons into a single category, thusmasking class and ethnic differences. Similarly, while diverse communities maybe similar in that they share a marginalized status, they continue to differ in termsof history, traditions, beliefs, and values. In other words, each community has itsown culture and it is equally important to understand the similarities as well asdifferences across the communities. The term “diversity,” then, also cannot serveas a substitute for the term “culture.”
Culture
Culture is a difficult term to define simply and without ambiguity. The concept
consists of several elements, some of which are explicit, others implicit. Mostoften these elements are described in terms of behaviours, values, norms, and basicassumptions. Culture is said to constitute several layers. The shallow first layerreflects behaviour and represents the explicit culture. It is what is seen and inter-preted by others. The second layer, deeper and more implicit, is that of values, andthe core of culture is formed by basic assumptions that often are hidden, even fromthose who belong to the cultural group (Groeschl & Doherty, 2000).
Classic and current definitions of culture include the following:
■“The learned, shared, and transmitted knowledge of values, beliefs, norms,and lifeways of a particular group of people that guides an individual orgroup in their thinking, decisions, and actions in patterned ways.” (Leininger,1995, p. 60)
■“Any group of people who share experiences, language, and values thatpermit them to communicate knowledge not shared by those outside theculture.” (American Medical Association, 1999, p. viii)
■“Shared patterns of learned behaviour and values that are transmitted overtime, and that distinguish the members of any one group from another. Inthis broad sense, culture can include ethnicity, language, religion, and spir-itual beliefs, gender, socio-economic class, age, sexual orientation,geographic origin, group history, education, upbringing and life experi-ences.” (Canadian Nurses Association, 2004, p. 2)
Some authors equate culture with ethnicity, but the above definitions are
broader, referring to patterns within groups without specifying whether those12 Foundation Stones
involved are part of a minority group at all.  “Culture,” then , is a term that applies 
to any group of people where there are comm on values and ways of thinking and 
acting that differ from those of another gr oup. 
Cultural Competence 
Just as there are many definitions of culture in healthcare literature, so, too, are
there many descriptions and definitions of cultural competence. Leininger talkedabout the need for culturally competent care in the late 1960s and called on nursesand other healthcare providers to develop a comparative focus to illustrate patterns,expressions, values, and “lifeways” within and between cultures (Leininger, 1991).(Lifeways is a term used to describe a cultural group’ s way of life with respect to
customs and practices.) Culturally competent nursing care was defined as the“explicit use of culturally based care and health knowledge in sensitive, creative,and meaningful ways” (Leininger, 2002b, p. 84). Within the medical domain, theterm was first defined by mental health researchers over a decade ago as a set ofcongruent behaviours, attitudes, and policies that come together to work effec-tively in cross-cultural situations (Cross, Bazron, & Issacs, 1989). 
The concept of cultural competence includes respect, as well as knowledge
and skills and the ability to use them effectively in cross-cultural situations (Brach& Fraser, 2000; Sue, 2001). Table 1-2 provides a range of definitions for culturalUnderstanding Cultural Competence in Health Care 13

Definitions of Cultural Competence
■A continuous, evolutionary process of pursuing cultural awareness, knowledge,
skill, and encounters. (Camphina-Bacote, 1995)
■The ability to effectively deal with persons and groups of diverse backgrounds.(Capers, 1994)
■Care that is sensitive to issues related to heritage, sexual orientation, socio-economic situation, ethnicity, and cultural background, and is provided withan understanding of how those differences may inform the responses of thepeople and the care processes. (Meleis, 1999, p. 12)
■Care that is free of stereotypes and assumptions or demonstrated awareness.(Wilson, Sanner, & McAllister, 2003, p. 8)
■Simply the level of knowledge-based skills required to provide effective clinicalcare to clients from a particular ethnic or racial group. (US Department ofHealth and Human Services, 2001)
■Application of knowledge, skill, attitudes, and personal attributes required bynurses to provide appropriate care and services in relation to the culturalcharacteristics of their clients. Cultural competence includes valuing diversity,knowing about the cultural norms and traditions of the populations beingserved, and being sensitive to these while providing care to individuals.(Canadian Nurses Association, 2004, p. 1)

competence. Hudecek (2002) cites five essential elements of cultural competence
that healthcare providers need: 
1. Valuing cultural diversity2. Having the capacity for cultural self-assessment3. Being conscious of the “dynamics” inherent when cultures interact4. Having institutionalized cultural knowledge5. Developing adaptations in service delivery that reflect an understanding
of cultural diversity
Rodriguez (1999) notes that being culturally competent does not mean know-
ing everything about every culture or needing to abandon our own cultural iden-tity; rather, it means a respect for differences and a willingness to accept the ideathat there are many ways of viewing the world. 
Regardless of the specific definition, underpinning the concept of cultural
competence is the assumption that competence transforms knowledge and under-standing into effective healthcare responses or interventions. Also, there isgeneral agreement that cultural competence includes attitude (awareness), knowl-edge, and skill, and represents a lifelong process. In this respect, cultural compe-tence is regarded as a verb, not a noun.
The Cultural Competence Continuum 
Cultural competence has been described as a continuum that ranges fromcultural destructiveness to cultural proficiency (Cross, 2001; Kerr, Struthers, &Huynh, 2001; National Alliance for Hispanic Health, 2001) (see Figure 1-1).Unlike other approaches that advocate cultural competence as a method ofenhancing the quality and effectiveness of care, the Cultural CompetenceContinuum clearly highlights that a lack of competence can actually be destruc-tive. In other words, cultural competence is a necessary ingredient for effectivecare and cannot simply be equated with icing on the cake. Although the contin-uum is presented in a linear fashion, it should not be interpreted as a series ofpredetermined, rigid phases; rather, it presents possible ways to respond tocultural differences and the steps outline developmental tasks that reflect growthtoward a goal of cultural proficiency.
The extreme negative end of the continuum, cultural destructiveness , refers
to attitudes, practices, and organizational policies that focus on the superiority ofone culture to the extent that other cultures are dehumanized and destroyed.Historical examples of cultural destructiveness can be found with respect toCanadian Aboriginals whose children were removed from their homes and placedin residential schools run by non-Aboriginal people (Industry Canada, n.d.). Anexample from the United States is the Tuskegee, Alabama, experiments, in whichBlack men with syphilis were observed but not treated for a number of yearsbecause researchers were interested in studying the disease progression(Cantwell, n.d.). Cultural destructiveness can occur in individual healthcareprovider–client encounters as well. Rorie and colleagues (1996) note that whenthe insensitivity or prejudice of the healthcare provider impedes health care, itcrosses the line from cultural incompetence to destructiveness. 14 Foundation Stones
Cultural incapacity refers to the inability of healthcare providers and institu-
tions to help clients from different cultures. The dominant client group serves as
the norm for all care, and systemic biases lead to paternalism or exclusionaryapproaches for diverse communities. The subtle and not-so-subtle messages arethat members of communities that are different are not welcomed, valued, or ableto fit into the systems of care. The expectation is that the minority culture willadapt to, accept, and even be grateful for, the care provided. Cultural incapacityis said to exist when healthcare providers are aware of the need to do things differ-ently but do not recognize the significance of cultural competence or see it astheir role, or else feel powerless against the “system” (Rorie et al., 1996). The lackof language interpretation services may be one example of cultural incapacity.
Cultural blindness occurs when the existence of cultural differences is
denied in a desire to be unbiased and treat all clients identically. Cultural blind-ness prevents us from examining the longstanding systemic biases that exist inour clinical practices and in ourselves, and thus prevents us from developing waysof enhancing the safety and quality of healthcare experiences for all communities.Healthcare providers who feel it is critical to approach all their clients the sameway are at risk for cultural blindness. There are numerous examples of culturalUnderstanding Cultural Competence in Health Care 15

blindness in clinical practice. For example, Canadian hospital settings have long
had a tradition of giving clients cold water with their medications, even thoughmany cultures avoid cold foods and liquids during times of illness. Similarly,healthcare providers who allocate the same amount of time for each client’ s visitand ask the same questions as part of the initial assessment fail to recognizedifferential needs and thus may exhibit culturally blind behaviours. 
Cultural pre-competence refers to the recognition of needs based on culture
and some movement toward meeting those needs. Examples of cultural pre-competence include:
■The desire to deliver high-quality, cost-effective services
■A commitment to civil rights and social justice
■Engagement with individuals and communities to ask, “What can we do?”
■Development of inclusive policies and workforce diversity initiatives
At the individual level, healthcare providers often desire to seek out learning
experiences by working with diverse communities. However, one of the dangersof cultural pre-competence is a false sense of accomplishment or tokenism. Oftenhealthcare providers believe that engaging in one or two initiatives makes themculturally competent, and thus further progress along the continuum is compro-mised. Demoralization is another potential difficulty that can arise when health-care providers encounter challenges during activities and initiatives at this stage.Lack of progress is regarded as failure, which in turn can lead to reluctance tomake subsequent efforts, and again progress on the continuum is compromised(Cross, 2001; National Alliance for Hispanic Health, 2001).
Cultural competence is characterized by a recognition of, and respect for,
difference and an ongoing effort toward self-assessment and working withdiversity. Cultural competence requires an understanding of the relationshipbetween policy and practice and a commitment to policies that enhance serv-ices to culturally diverse communities (National Alliance for Hispanic Health,2001). Cultural competence, then, is “a set of behaviours and attitudes . . . thattakes into account the person’ s cultural background, cultural beliefs, and incor-porates it into the way health care is delivered to that individual” (Betancourt,Green, & Carillo, 2002, p. 3).
The last stage of the Cultural Competence Continuum is described as
cultural proficiency. Practitioners and organizations in this stage value diversity
and seek out the positive role that culture can play in health and health care.Rather than just providing unbiased care, culturally proficient healthcareproviders and agencies look for opportunities to create new knowledge and inno-vative practices to ensure high-quality health care for all (Rorie et al., 1996). 
Along the same lines as the Cultural Competence Continuum, Tripp-Reimer
et al. (2001) describe a four-stage continuum of culturally responsive interven-tions: culturally neutral, culturally sensitive, culturally innovative, and culturallytransformative. Culturally neutral interventions are described as those that repre-sent standard practice. However, in reality, these interventions are not culturallyneutral because, as the authors note, they are “generally developed by Anglo prac-titioners and tested for efficacy with Anglo clients” (p. 18). Culturally sensitiveinterventions modify standard approaches by using bilingual/bicultural materials16 Foundation Stones
(e.g., food or prayer) and address issues of access (e.g., hours of operation).
Culturally innovative interventions involve the intentional and active use ofcultural elements to develop interventions using cultural themes, metaphors, orkey cultural institutions such as ethnic media. Last, culturally transformative inter-ventions mean change in the structural elements involving power and oppression.Examples of transformative interventions include programs that involve culturalcommunities in the design and delivery of health care, with a plan for sustainabil-ity driven by the cultural groups. 
Communication and Intercultural 
Sensitivity Continuum(s) 
Other models that can be applied to the development of cultural competence
include Howell’ s Levels of Communication Competence and Bennett’ s Model ofIntercultural Sensitivity (Crandall, George, Marion, & Davis, 2003). Howelldescribes a communication continuum of five levels that learners undergo whendeveloping empathic communication skills. The first level is that of unconsciousincompetence, in which a person does not recognize that she or he is miscommu-nicating. In the second level, learners recognize their mistakes but are generallyunable to correct the problems. The third level adds a layer of understanding withrespect to what strategies are useful. The fourth and fifth levels are those ofunconscious competence and unconscious “supercompetence,” respectively,where learners function at a proficient or expert level, modifying their interac-tions with others as needed without conscious thought and/or pronounced effortto interact (Crandall et al., 2003). 
Similarly, Bennett proposes a six-stage model of intercultural sensitivity that
begins with denial and evolves through the stages of defence, minimization,Understanding Cultural Competence in Health Care 17
CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN ACTION
Caring for a Deaf Client
A deaf client arrives in a rural emergency department, complaining of
abdominal pain. The client is escorted to an examination room and an inter-preter is requested. An hour and a half later, the client has still not been
evaluated medically. When asked why, the nurse simply replies, “She is deaf
and mute, and we are waiting for the interpreter. The doctor will not comeuntil the interpreter arrives, and since it’s a weekend, it may be a whilebefore one arrives . . . we’ll just have to wait.”

Cultural Competence Continuum?
2. What could have been done differently to provide culturally competent
care?

acceptance, adaptation, and integration. Bennett’ s model has subsequently been
revised and collapsed into five stages: stages one and two reflect complete lackof, or minimal, healthcare provider insight about the influence of culture on care;stage three reflects an understanding, on the healthcare provider’ s part, of theinfluence of culture in care and a belief in negotiating with the client with respectto care; and stages four and five reflect an inclusion of cultural awareness intoprofessional practice by incorporating “help me understand” questions andadjusting to a wide range of cultural beliefs (Crandall et al., 2003). Regardless ofwhich model or framework is used, it is critical that healthcare providers recog-nize that they need to learn and exhibit more culturally competent behaviours. 
Differentiating Cultural Competence 
from Client-Centred Care 
A question that healthcare providers often ask is how clinical cultural competence
is different from “client-centred” or “client-focused” care. Client-centred care canbe defined as “an approach where clients are viewed as whole persons; it is notmerely about delivering services where the client is located. Client-centred careinvolves advocacy, empowerment, and respecting the client’ s autonomy, voice,self-determination, and participation in decision making” (RNAO, 2002b, p. 12).Fundamental components of client-centred care include identifying client prefer-ences for health care, hearing and respecting client choices, and involving clientsin decision making. In theory there is significant overlap between client-centredcare and cultural competence, but in practice the client-centred approach has notyet demonstrated adequate attention to cultural issues (Bowen, 2004). In fact, itcan be argued that literature on healthcare disparity indicates that clinicallycompetent, caring healthcare providers unknowingly provide care that is cultur-ally ineffective or unsafe.
Clearly, clinical cultural competence is not just about understanding client
cultural values, but also about understanding our own limitations; valuing diver-sity; and managing the potential dynamics of systemic bias, racism, prejudice,and exclusion within client–health provider relationships. Discussions of culturaldynamics need to include consideration of ways in which culture intersects withissues of power and equity. In other words, clinical cultural competence can be re-defined as the ability to provide care with a client-centred orientation that bothreflects the client’ s cultural values and beliefs and recognizes the impact ofmarginalization in healthcare interactions and responses.
Levels of Cultural Competence 
Within the healthcare literature, cultural competence largely has been addressedat three levels: individual, organizational, and systemic. 
Individual Cultural Competence 
The majority of literature on cultural competence is either explicitly or implicitlyaimed at the individual healthcare provider operating within the broader context of18 Foundation Stones
professional practice. For example, nursing literature talks about the importance of
the nurse understanding cultural issues with the aim of strengthening nursing prac-tice. Similarly, social work, psychology, and psychiatry highlight issues and strate-gies for the respective practitioners with implications for the profession as a whole(Kirmayer & Minas, 2000; Leininger, 2002a; Masi, 1988; Sue, 2001; Tsang &George, 1998). The underlying theme is that healthcare providers need to under-stand the issues and apply the knowledge in order to enhance their own practiceand help develop the profession. The focus is on enhancing healthcare providers’awareness of cultural issues and health beliefs and providing tools and strategiesto elicit, negotiate, and manage this information. In some ways, the healthcareprovider’ s role becomes that of a cultural broker who serves as a bridge betweenthe culture of the client and that of the healthcare system. Cultural brokering inhealth care has been described as “the act of bridging, linking, or mediatingbetween groups or persons of differing cultural backgrounds for the purpose ofreducing conflict or producing change” (Jezewski, 1995, p. 16). It involves thehealthcare provider using cultural and health science knowledge and skills to nego-tiate a healthcare plan that is relevant and effective for the client (Wenger, 1995).
Organizational Cultural Competence 
Literature on organizational cultural competence focuses on systems within thehealthcare delivery process and emphasizes the need for organizational change byzeroing in on organizational structure, governance, policy, and programs (Bowen,2004; Srivastava, in press). Although considerable literature exists on frameworksand guidelines regarding institutional or organizational diversity, there is ageneral lack of empirical research on organizational diversity, and the literaturerelies on theoretical and anecdotal reports (Bowen, 2004).
Organizational interventions address systems issues for two main reasons:1. To increase access, by trying to reduce barriers such as hours and location
of service availability, and by providing language support and reducingfinancial burden through support for transportation and treatment costs
2. To increase the organization’ s capacity to serve a diverse population,
through initiatives such as education and training, enhancing workforcediversity, and outreach activities involving community partnerships
Brach and Fraser (2000) identify nine cultural competency techniques at the orga-nizational level that can reduce health disparities:
■Interpreter services
■Recruitment and retention policies (of minority group members)
■Training
■Coordination with traditional healers
■Use of community healthcare workers (to serve as culture brokers and liaisons)
■Culturally competent health promotion
■Inclusion of family and community members
■Immersion into another culture (to overcome one’ s own ethnocentrism)
■Administrative and organizational accommodations (including alteringphysical environments and written materials, which influences access andutilization)Understanding Cultural Competence in Health Care 19
Brach and Fraser propose that interventions at the organizational level will lead
to changes in the behaviour of the healthcare provider and the client, therebyresulting in overall improved communication, enhanced trust, greater healthcareprovider knowledge of differential epidemiology and treatment efficacy, andexpanded understanding of clients’ cultural behaviours and environment (2000).
System-Level Cultural Competence 
Literature in this category addresses systems issues beyond the healthcare organ-izations and health services delivery system, and reflects a focus on such steps asrecruiting minority students to health professions and examining curricularcontent, professional standards, accreditation standards, rights legislation, andresearch agendas and funding (Bowen, 2004). Examples of such initiativesinclude the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Reducing HealthDisparities Initiative, which has built tremendous research capacity; generatedalliances between researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and the public; andtranslated research knowledge into information that can be used to developprograms, policies, and practices in health care (Beiser, 2005). 
Team-Level Cultural Competence 
This fourth level of cultural competence is a recent proposal (Srivastava, inpress). Cultural competence at the team level means creating an environment thatpromotes healthy dialogue on differences by setting up mechanisms in the careprocess that allow for the exchange of diverse viewpoints and knowledge, in orderto develop innovative and transformative interventions (Dreachslin, Sprainer, &Jimpson, 2002; Rosenzweig, 1998). Team-level competence is seen as necessaryto link the organization’ s espoused values to day-to-day care practice. Puttingpolicy in place is often hampered by differing priorities of individual staff, partic-ularly those in senior or more authoritative and leadership positions. For example,an individual’ s attempts at cultural assessment may not be valued or seen as legit-imate if this is not part of the usual protocol or if the process will take too longand thus be considered impractical. Team-level cultural competence makes thegroup values explicit, establishes and/or clarifies group norms, and draws on thestrength of the collective to support the group’ s culture. 
SUMMARY
There is agreement that clinical cultural competence means having the requisiteawareness, knowledge, and skills to address diversity. However, vagueness,inconsistencies, and variations in definition, content, and approaches to care havemade it difficult to put the concept into operation and have led to a wide range ofpractices related to culture and diversity. Cross-cultural encounters entail differ-ences in beliefs and approaches to health care and also reflect the dynamics ofdifference itself in the form of ethnocentrism, racism, prejudice, and exclusion atthe individual level as well as systemically. 20 Foundation Stones
For good outcomes in health care, cultural competence is needed at the indi-
vidual, team, organizational, and systemic levels. While each level can be devel-
oped in isolation, all levels need to work together to be effective (Srivastava, inpress). The synergy that comes from all levels working together further strength-ens each level. Cultural competence involves more than accepting diversity; italso means challenging systemic barriers and changing the existing structuresand practices that perpetuate intolerance, oppression, and inequity (Carter, 2001;Cortis, 2003).
This course has discus sed the need for c ultural competence in light of chang-
ing demographics a nd the evidence that health di sparities exis t across selected  
populations both in Ca nada and internationally.  Culture plays a pivotal role in 
health; however, there is much conf usion about the meaning of terms such as 
“culture” and “cultur al competence” and t he related terms of “ethnicity,” “diver-
sity,” “minority,” and “marginalizat ion.” Discussion of the Cultura l Competence 
Continuum and of the levels of cultural co mpetence further illustrates the 
complexity of the iss ues surrounding cu ltural competence in clinical care.

THE TAPING TRAP FOR PI Cases
	
  	
  	
  	
   The Problemü No ofﬁcial CPT code for tapingü Payers aggressively sending taping to SIUü SIU triggers IME to dispute necessityü Entire claim gets damaged from preventable coding errors	
  The Taping Trap
	
  	
  	
  	
   AMA Positionü 29xxx series codes used for immobilizationü Post-fracture or injury scenariosü Casting/strapping for initial care only	
  The Taping Trap: Complications
	
  	
  	
  	
     CPT / ACA Positionü Possible to use strapping if immobilization     (but then 1 visit limit may apply)ü If tape is used to facilitate movement or provide support depending on intentØ 97112 Ø 97110	
  Taping Trap: MORE Complications
	
  	
  	
  	
  ü 97112 usage (PI payer opinion) ü Some PI payers view for severe trauma that involves neuro injuryü Or for stroke victimü Therefore, 97112 may not be great option	
  Taping Trap: MORE Complicationsx2
	
  	
  	
  	
     ü Use 97110 in conjunction with exercise (meet 8 min limit)ü Use 97139 as unlisted procedure (if your taping time is brief <8mins)ü Tape faster or not at all ☺

THE CONCUSSION-SUBLUXATION COMPLEX

INTRODUCTION   
What Is Concussion? 

In 2004, the International Olympic Committee Medical Commission in partnership with other groups organized a conference to develop recommendations for improving the health and safety of athletes who suffer concussive injuries.1 This conference was held in Prague, Czech Republic. 
	A detailed definition was offered in the most recent follow-up to the Prague conference, held in Zurich in 20122,2-a:






ZURICH:
 “Concussion is a brain injury and is defined as a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by biomechanical forces. Several common features that incorporate clinical, pathologic and biomechanical injury constructs that may be utilized in defining the nature of a concussive head injury include:


Concussion may be caused by either a direct blow to the head, face, neck or elsewhere on the body with an ‘impulsive’ force transmitted to the head.


ZURICH
Concussion typically results in rapid onset of short-lived impairment of neurological function that resolves spontaneously. However, in some cases, symptoms and signs may evolve over a number of minutes to hours.
ZURICH

Concussion may result in neuropathological changes, but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than a structural injury and, as such, no abnormality is seen on standard structural neuroimaging studies.

Concussion results in a graded set of clinical symptoms that may or may not involve loss of consciousness. Resolution of the clinical and cognitive symptoms typically follows a sequential course. However, it is important to note that in some cases symptoms may be prolonged.”




CDC
  	According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the term “mild tramatic brain injury” (mTBI) is used interchangeably with “concussion”.3 
	While the exact pathophysiology of concussion is incompletely understood, its manifestations are consistent with a reduction in the metabolic rate of multiple portions of the brain. In other words, a concussion is an energy crisis in the brain. The precise brain areas involved vary from person to person. Therefore, a good clinical rule to keep in mind is no two concussions are alike.

VSC AND CONCUSSION: THE CONCUSSION-SUBLUXATION COMPLEX

{CSC Proposed Definition: “A constellation of mutually exacerbating pathophysiological manifestations of concussion and vertebral subluxation complex.” (The vertebral subluxation complex can be generated or exacerbated by the same trauma that caused the concussion.)}1A

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF CONCUSSION: HISTORY
















	








 

    

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF CONCUSSION: 
BALANCE EXAMINATION
Note: The value of any of the physical examinations steps described in this course is greatly increased when there is a pre-injury measurement to compare it to. For this reason, practitioners with responsibility for a sports team, combat detachment, or other group with a high risk of concussion may consider including all or some of these in a baseline examination. In fact, baseline examinations may be a good service to offer in general.

SAMPLE CASE: 2015-2016 SEMINAR RESEARCH WORKSHEET: Reverse Digit Span
Doctor’s Name: ___Charles S. Masarsky, D.C._____________________________
Today’s Date: _______8-2-2015______________________________
Date of Patient Presentation:___7-3-2015______________________
Phone, other contact info: Phone: 703-938-6441; e-mail: viennachiropractic@verizon.net

How the Test Is Done
The examiner speaks a series of digits, asking the patient to repeat them in reverse order. The digits are spoken in a monotone, with equal spacing between each, not clumped together like a phone number.  For example, the examiner would say, “Eight, four, seven,” and the patient would say, “Seven, four, eight.” After this, a series of four digits, then five, etc. would be used, until the patient fails to repeat them in reverse order. The number of digits in the series prior to the patient’s error is their reverse digit span. For example, if they succeed with the above series, but fail with a series of four, their reverse digit span is 3. For an adult with average powers of attention, the reverse digit span should be 5 or greater.
Digit Lists
Choose a different list (or construct your own) for each successive test to minimize rehearsal effect. 

3-0-5      		6-9-3			5-4-1
4-7-6-1			3-7-0-9			9-4-6-8
6-9-2-7-1		1-5-2-8-6		8-1-6-4-3
7-1-8-4-6-2		5-3-9-1-4-8		0-7-4-6-2-5

Patient Presentation
In one or two paragraphs, briefly describe the patient’s presentation, with particular attention to anything that may have alerted you to a possible deficit in short term memory and/or attention. Also, indicate if this is a new or established patient. 

	A 25-year-old professional baseball player presented for his first visit with main complaints of headache (7/10) and dizziness (5/10). Five days prior to presentation, he attempted a slide into third base and collided head first with the fielder’s leg. He felt no symptoms other than neck-shoulder-upper back soreness at the time of the injury. Headache and dizziness were noticed the next day. 
    	The patient apologized for being late for the appointment. He had trouble locating his car keys, which he had absent-mindedly left in the freezer. He stated he is not usually so “spacey”.   
Initial Reverse Digit Span: _____3____

Follow-Up Reverse Digit Span: __6____
Please indicate the time frame of the follow up (immediately post-adjustment on first visit, upon progress examination on twelfth visit, etc.)
Immediately post-adjustment on first visit.

Chiropractic Assessment Techniques and Findings:
	Based on motion palpation, subluxations were noted at the C7-T1 and T11-12 motion segments. Manual muscle testing revealed inhibition of right wrist flexors and left iliopsoas muscles. Applied Kinesiology challenge revealed “temporal bulge” cranial fault on the right side.

Chiropractic Adjustment Techniques:
Vertebral subluxations corrected with diversified techniques. Temporal bulge corrected by respiratory assist adjustment.

Was There Anything About This Patient or Your Technique, or Your Assessment that You Feel Contributed in a Negative or Positive Way to the Outcome?
	When I adjusted C7, the patient remarked that he felt more “clear” mentally. This was a spontaneous remark, which I did not prompt in any way.

What Would Be Helpful In Terms of Technique, Assessment, Etc In Dealing With Such Patients in the Future? This Can Be Existing or Future Technology/Techniques/Information, etc.
	This may sound a bit self-serving, but it would be very helpful to have victims of these sorts of athletic injuries to be assessed by a D.C. 24-48 hours later, even on-site evaluation was within normal limits. Barring cooperation from the teams in this area, maybe an attempt to educate the athletes themselves will alert them to the need to self-refer after a head-neck injury.
	Other than the “tricorder” from Star Trek, I can’t think of any technology I’d like right now.

Natural Approaches to Epilepsy
Alan R. Gaby, MD











Abstract
This article reviews research on the use of diet, nutritional supplements, and hormones in the treatment of epilepsy. Potentially beneficial dietary interventions include identifying and treating blood glucose dysregulation, identifying and avoiding allergenic foods, and avoiding suspected triggering agents such as alcohol, aspartame, and monosodium glutamate. The ketogenic diet may be considered for severe, treatment-resistant cases. The Atkins diet (very low in carbohydrates) is a less restrictive type of ketogenic diet that may be effective in some cases. Nutrients that may reduce seizure frequency include vitamin B6, magnesium, vitamin E, manganese, taurine, dimethylglycine, and omega-3 fatty acids. Administration of thiamine may improve cognitive function in patients with epilepsy. Supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6, biotin, vitamin D, and L-carnitine may be needed to prevent or treat deficiencies resulting from the use of anticonvulsant drugs. Vitamin K1 has been recommended near the end of pregnancy for women taking anticonvulsants. Melatonin may reduce seizure frequency in some cases, and progesterone may be useful for women with cyclic exacerbations of seizures. In most cases, nutritional therapy is not a substitute for anticonvulsant medications. However, in selected cases, depending on the effectiveness of the interventions, dosage reductions or discontinuation of medications may be possible. (Altern Med Rev 2007;12(1):9-24)
Introduction
Epilepsy is a disorder of brain electrical activity that results in recurrent seizures. The type of seizure de- pends on the portion of the brain affected. While there are many different causes of seizures, including brain tumor, head injury, stroke, and alcohol withdrawal, the discussion in this article is limited mainly to cases in which the cause is idiopathic (primary epilepsy).
Conventional treatment of epilepsy consists primarily of anticonvulsant medications. Although these drugs often control or reduce the frequency of sei- zures, some patients show little or no improvement.
A number of dietary modifications, nutritional supplements, and hormones have been found to be ben- eficial for some patients with epilepsy.
Potentially useful dietary interventions include measures to stabilize blood glucose levels, identifica- tion and avoidance of allergenic foods, and avoidance of potential inciting agents (such as ethanol and aspar- tame). The ketogenic diet has been successful for many patients, but because of its highly restrictive nature and potential to cause significant adverse effects, its use is restricted to severe cases that fail to respond to other treatments. A less restrictive version of the ketogenic diet, the Atkins diet, has shown promise and deserves further study.
Several different nutrients (and two hormones) may also be beneficial in selected patients with epilep- sy. The fact that nutritional factors are involved in the regulation of electrical activity in the brain is indicated

by the fact that severe deficiency of thiamine, mag- nesium, or vitamin B6 can cause seizures. A subnor- mal concentration of each of these nutrients has been found to be common in patients with epilepsy. While the severity of these deficiencies is probably not great enough in most cases to cause seizures in otherwise healthy people, marginal status with respect to any of these nutrients could conceivably exacerbate a seizure disorder due to another cause.
In addition, some patients with epilepsy might have a higher-than-normal requirement for one or more nutrients that play a role in brain elec- trical activity. That phenomenon has been clearly demonstrated in the case of vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy, a condition in which intractable seizures can be completely controlled by administration of large doses of vitamin B6. The existence of this relatively rare syndrome raises the possibility that more subtle forms of nutrient dependency occur more commonly. While mildly or moderately increased requirements for vitamin B6 or other nutrients may not by them- selves be sufficient to cause seizures, a failure to meet these increased requirements could aggravate an ex- isting seizure disorder.
Some studies have found that supplemen- tation with individual nutrients reduced seizure fre- quency or improved other aspects of health in patients with epilepsy, but other studies have failed to confirm those findings. Administration of combinations of nutrients might be more effective than supplementing with a single nutrient, but that possibility has largely been unexplored. Nutrient supplementation may also be necessary to prevent or reverse the effects of cer- tain deficiencies that frequently result from the use of anticonvulsant drugs. The potential benefits of nutri- ent supplementation in patients with epilepsy must be weighed against reports that large doses of certain nutrients (such as vitamin B6 and folic acid) can in- terfere with the effects of anticonvulsants.
Because there are many different types of ep- ilepsy, a nutritional intervention that is helpful for one patient may not be beneficial for another. Some stud- ies did not specify the types of epilepsy being treated, so it is difficult to generalize results. Nevertheless, natural approaches to the treatment of epilepsy show promise and should be considered as part of the over- all treatment of epilepsy.
Dietary Factors
Hypoglycemia/Hyperinsulinemia
Seizures are a known manifestation of hypo- glycemia.1,2 In patients with epilepsy, hypoglycemia might decrease the threshold for seizure development. In one study of 92 patients with epilepsy, 56.4 percent were found to have a subnormal fasting blood glucose concentration.3
In addition, transient EEG abnormalities have been observed in some patients during a glucose toler- ance test. These abnormalities occurred, not when the blood glucose level was at its lowest point, but at a time that insulin levels would have been expected to be ele- vated.4 These EEG changes were hypothesized to result from insulin-induced transport of water and electro- lytes into the brain, leading to cerebral hyperosmolality. While the observed EEG changes were not necessarily of the type associated with seizures, these findings raise the possibility that hyperinsulinemia could trigger sei- zures in patients with epilepsy.
Thus, hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia might each contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy in some cases. Patients with epilepsy who have evidence of these abnormalities might benefit from nutritional interventions, such as avoiding refined sugar, caffeine, and alcohol; eating frequently; consuming adequate amounts of protein; and supplementing with chromi- um, other trace minerals, magnesium, and B vitamins.

Food Allergy
In case reports, specific foods were implicated in epilepsy causation;5 the avoidance of symptom-evok- ing foods resulted in a reduction in seizure frequency or elimination of seizures.6,7 In a study of 63 children with epilepsy, identification and avoidance of allergenic foods was frequently successful for patients who had other symptoms suggestive of allergy, but not for chil- dren who had epilepsy alone.
For four weeks, 63 children with epilepsy un- derwent an elimination diet consisting of lamb, chicken, potato, rice, banana, apple, cabbage, sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, cucumber, celery, carrots, parsnips, water, salt, pepper, pure herbs, calcium, and vitamins. Of 18 chil- dren who had epilepsy alone, none improved. The other 45 children with epilepsy also had recurrent migraines, abdominal symptoms, or hyperkinetic behavior. Of



those children, 55.6 percent stopped having seizures and an additional 24.4 percent had fewer seizures dur- ing diet therapy (a total of 80 percent with complete or partial resolution of seizures). Headaches, abdominal pains, and hyperkinetic behavior resolved in all patients whose seizures resolved, as well as in some patients who continued to have seizures. Symptoms were evoked by 42 different foods, and seizures occurred after ingestion of 31 different foods. Most children reacted to several foods. Both generalized epilepsy (including myoclonic seizures and petit mal) and partial epilepsy improved on the diet. In double-blind, placebo-controlled food chal- lenges, symptoms recurred in 15 of 16 children, includ- ing seizures in eight cases, after ingestion of offending foods; whereas, no symptoms recurred when placebo was given.8
The prevalence of celiac disease has been found to be higher in patients with epilepsy than in controls (1/44 versus 1/244, respectively).9 Seizures have im- proved in patients with celiac disease who consumed a gluten-free diet,10 but only when the diet was started soon after the onset of epilepsy.11 Most epileptic pa- tients with celiac disease did not have gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of presentation, so testing for ce- liac disease should be considered even in the absence of such symptoms. Some patients with epilepsy and celiac disease have also been found to have cerebral calcifica- tions,12-14 the significance of which is not clear.

Dietary Inciting Factors
In some cases, epileptic seizures have been trig- gered by excessive alcohol intake.15
Two case reports indicate ingestion of mono- sodium glutamate appeared to trigger or exacerbate sei- zures in children.16
Grand mal seizures have occurred after con- sumption of aspartame by people who had no prior history of epilepsy.17,18 Ingestion of a drink containing aspartame (40 mg/kg body weight) also exacerbated EEG spike-wave discharges in children with a history of absence seizures.19
However, in trials funded by the NutraSweet Company (the manufacturer of aspartame), adminis- tration of aspartame (34 mg/kg/day for two weeks or a single dose of 50 mg/kg) did not provoke seizures in pa- tients with epilepsy or in people who reported a history
of aspartame-induced seizures.20,21 A potential limita- tion of these trials is that aspartame was administered in capsules, rather than in soft drinks or other aspartame- containing foods or beverages. As aspartame in com- mercial products is said to undergo chemical changes on exposure to high temperatures or after storage for more than two months, these degradation products may be partly responsible for the reported adverse effects of as- partame.22 Therefore, symptoms that occur after inges- tion of aspartame-containing commercial products or hot drinks to which aspartame has been added may not be reproducible by challenging with aspartame in cap- sules. Based on the available evidence, aspartame should be considered a potential trigger for seizures and should be excluded during an elimination diet.

Ketogenic Diet
The ketogenic diet has been used since 1921 to control seizures in children who do not respond to anticonvulsant medications.23-31 The diet is calorie-re- stricted and provides a ratio of fat to (carbohydrate + protein) ranging from 2:1 to 5:1. The proportion of to- tal energy derived from fat ranges from 82-92 percent. Consuming a ketogenic diet produces a state of keto- sis, which helps control seizures through an unknown mechanism. Fluid intake is restricted to maintain urine specific gravity at 1.020-1.025, since fluid intake dilutes blood ketones.
In different studies, 40-70 percent of patients following the diet experienced at least a 50-percent re- duction in seizure frequency, and 10-33 percent became seizure-free. In many cases, medications could be dis- continued or the dosages decreased. Two children with acquired epileptic aphasia were also successfully treated with this diet.32 According to some research, myoclonic epilepsy responds best to the ketogenic diet.26 However, another study found that the response to the diet did not vary significantly according to seizure type.25 The diet is most effective in children ages 2-5 years, although patients of other ages have also benefited.26
To be effective, the diet must be followed strict- ly; if the patient discontinues it, seizures are likely to return within hours. Typically, treatment is initiated in the hospital, starting with a 36-hour water fast to in- duce ketosis; however, some investigators have found that it is not necessary to begin the diet with a fast.






The ketogenic diet is usually followed for about two years, after which the proportion of fat is reduced gradually over 6-9 months to that of a regular diet. Af- ter a patient has been on the diet for two years, seizures are less likely to recur on resumption of a normal diet. In some cases, the diet regimen is repeated if seizures recur.
There are some drawbacks to the ketogenic diet. Supplementation with multivitamins, calcium, and iron is necessary to prevent nutritional deficiencies. In addition, the ketogenic diet is unpalatable and is diffi- cult for parents to administer.

Ketogenic Diet for Adults
While most ketogenic diet studies have been conducted in children, one trial investigated its effect in 11 adults (ages 19-45 years; median, 32.2 years) with refractory epilepsy. At eight months of follow-up, three patients had a 90-percent reduction in seizure frequen- cy compared with baseline, three patients had a 50- to 89-percent decrease, and one patient had a less-than- 50-percent decrease. All types of seizures responded to the diet. Common adverse effects included constipation, menstrual irregularities, and increases in triglyceride levels and cholesterol/HDL ratios.33

Ketogenic Diet with Medium-chain Triglycerides
The triglycerides of octanoic and decanoic ac- ids (medium-chain triglycerides; MCTs) are more ke- togenic than long-chain triglycerides present in dietary fats. Diets containing large proportions of MCTs (usu- ally provided by supplementing with MCT oil) are also easier to prepare, more palatable, better tolerated, and require less carbohydrate and protein restriction than standard ketogenic diets.
The MCT ketogenic diet, which provides 50- 70 percent of total energy in the form of MCTs, has been used as an alternative to the classic ketogenic diet.34-36 In one study, adherence to this diet resulted in improvement or complete control of seizures in 44 percent of 50 children with drug-resistant epilepsy.37 Children who have had a positive response to this diet may be able to taper off the diet after 3-4 years without experiencing a recurrence of seizures. While the MCT diet is frequently well tolerated, some patients abandon it because of gastrointestinal intolerance.
Ketogenic Diet: Adverse Effects
The ketogenic diet has caused a number of ad- verse effects, some serious. Initiation of the diet can re- sult in vomiting, hypoglycemia, or dehydration. In one study, serious adverse events (severe hypoproteinemia, Fanconi’s renal tubular acidosis, or marked abnormali- ties on liver function tests) occurred in five of 52 chil- dren on a ketogenic diet.38 Other potential side effects include increased bruising or other minor bleeding (in association with a prolonged bleeding time), constipa- tion, and diarrhea.39,40
Long-term problems include moderate growth retardation, renal stones (5-8% of cases), gallstones, acidosis or metabolic problems (particularly during ill- ness), recurrent infections, hypercholesterolemia, hy- peruricemia, vitamin deficiency, and feeding problems. Prolonged ketosis may raise the serum level of pheno- barbitone, which can result in alopecia, renal stones, and growth retardation.36
The ketogenic diet and anticonvulsant drugs both have an adverse effect on bone density, which can be partially reversed with vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine deficiency may also occur with the ketogenic diet, particularly in patients taking valproic acid. L-car- nitine supplementation is recommended for patients who have low serum carnitine levels.41
Patients on the ketogenic diet must be moni- tored closely by a practitioner experienced in its use.

Atkins Diet
The Atkins diet is a low-carbohydrate, high- fat diet used by millions of people for weight reduction. Like the ketogenic diet, the Atkins diet can induce a state of ketosis, but it has fewer restrictions on calories and protein. In addition, the Atkins diet does not re- quire fluid restriction and does not need to be started in the hospital.
According to one study, the Atkins diet may be an effective alternative to the ketogenic diet in some children with intractable epilepsy. Twenty children (ages 3-18 years) with intractable epilepsy, with at least three seizures per week, who had been treated with at least two anticonvulsants, followed a modified Atkins diet (nature of the modification not specified) over a six-month period. Carbohydrates were limited to 10 g/day for the first month and consumption of fats was



encouraged. All children received vitamin and calcium supplements. At six months, 13 patients (65%) had more than 50-percent improvement and seven patients (35%) had more than 90-percent improvement (four were seizure-free). Small increases were seen in serum cholesterol and blood urea nitrogen levels during the study.42
In another study, two adults (ages 42 and 52) with epilepsy showed no improvement on the Atkins diet.43 Table 1 weighs the evidence for various dietary/ metabolic interventions.
















Nutritional Supplements
Vitamin B6
Experimentally-induced vitamin B6 deficiency resulted in seizures in rats44 and swine.45 In the early 1950s, numerous infants in the United States devel- oped convulsions traced to the use of a formula that was deficient in pyridoxine.46,47 Seizures also occurred in an infant fed exclusively on powdered goat’s milk, which had undetectable levels of the vitamin. The seizures re- solved after supplementation with vitamin B6.48
Vitamin B6 deficiency has been found in a high proportion of patients with epilepsy. Of 62 drug-treat- ed epileptic patients, 55 percent had a subnormal blood level of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP).49 In a study of 68 institutionalized patients with severe epilepsy, 37 per- cent had a reduced serum concentration of pyridoxal.50 Low levels of vitamin B6 may be due in part to treat- ment with phenytoin, which has been associated with laboratory evidence of reduced vitamin B6 status (i.e.,
increased xanthurenic acid excretion following a tryp- tophan load).51 However, other factors may be involved as well, since there does not appear to be a strong rela- tionship between low vitamin B6 levels and use of any specific anticonvulsant medication.
Vitamin B6 supplementation is clearly benefi- cial in cases of vitamin B6-dependent seizures. Some studies have demonstrated improvements in patients with non-vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy as well, al- though the research has produced conflicting results.
















Vitamin B6-dependent Seizures
Vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy is a rare inher- ited disorder that usually presents with intractable sei- zures in the first six months of life. The seizures can be completely controlled by administration of large doses of vitamin B6,52,53 but if the condition is not treated promptly irreversible neurological damage may occur.
The diagnosis of vitamin B6 dependency can be established by intravenous administration of pyri- doxine, which results in cessation of seizures within minutes. Intravenous administration of vitamin B6 to infants after a long period of convulsions has been fol- lowed in some cases by acute hypotonia; in one case as- sisted ventilation was required.54 For that reason, resus- citation equipment should be available during a trial of intravenous vitamin B6.
Most patients can subsequently be maintained on 25-50 mg/day oral pyridoxine, although one child required 200 mg/day.55 Long-term supplementation is necessary; discontinuation of pyridoxine after several



years of good seizure control has resulted in death from status epilepticus.
Some patients with vitamin B6-dependent sei- zures present with an atypical picture, including later onset (up to 19 months of age),56,57 a seizure-free period before administration of pyridoxine, a long remission after withdrawal of pyridoxine, and an atypical seizure type. Because the spectrum of vitamin B6-dependent seizures is broader than initially thought, it has been recommended that a trial of vitamin B6 be considered in all infants and young children with intractable epi- lepsy.58
It is also recommended that women who have a child with vitamin B6 dependency receive vitamin B6 supplements during subsequent pregnancies.

Vitamin B6 for Non-vitamin B6-dependent Epilepsy
Vitamin B6 supplementation has been report- ed to be beneficial in some, but not all, studies of pa- tients with non-vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy.
Twenty-six children with epilepsy received 160 mg/day pyridoxine. Of the 19 patients with laboratory evidence of vitamin B6 deficiency (i.e., increased uri- nary excretion of xanthurenic acid following a trypto- phan load), nine had complete or partial amelioration of seizures, and some of these patients were able to discon- tinue anticonvulsant medication. Of the seven patients with a normal tryptophan load test, none responded to pyridoxine.59
Of three children (ages 3-8 years) with epilepsy associated with impaired intellectual development, pro- gressive emotional disturbances, and abnormal EEGs, all excreted elevated amounts of xanthurenic acid after a tryptophan load. After administration of 60-160 mg pyridoxine daily, tryptophan metabolism became nor- mal and substantial clinical improvement occurred.60
Pyridoxine (20 mg, 3-6 times daily) was given for an unspecified length of time to 14 epileptic patients, ages 2-17 years. All patients had petit mal and one also had grand mal epilepsy. Seizures ceased in five patients and became less frequent in three others.61
Fifty-six epileptic children received 160-200 mg pyridoxine daily for at least six weeks. Significant clinical improvement was seen in five cases.62
A 23-year-old man with recurrent seizures presented with status epilepticus, which resolved imme- diately following intravenous administration of 60 mg PLP. Prior to treatment, his serum pyridoxine concen- tration was markedly decreased (80% below the lower limit of normal).63
Pyridoxine was given intravenously to infants and children with acute, recurrent seizures due primar- ily to acute infections. A dose of 30 or 50 mg/kg/day was administered in 100-250 mL of 10-percent glucose over 2-4 hours and given for a few days. Anti-epileptic drugs were used as appropriate. The treatment was rated “very effective” (i.e., duration and frequency of seizures decreased by more than 75 percent after 24 hours) in
62.5 percent of patients receiving pyridoxine compared with 26 percent of control patients (p<0.001); both doses of pyridoxine were equally effective. Aside from transient flushing, no adverse effects were seen.64
In other studies, pyridoxine in doses of 20-100 mg/day orally65,66 or 300 mg/day parenterally67 pro- duced no clinical improvement in patients with various types of epilepsy.

Pyridoxine versus Pyridoxal Phosphate
While most patients with vitamin B6-depen- dent seizures can be effectively treated with pyridoxine, some patients have only responded to PLP, the biologi- cally active form of vitamin B6.68,69 The average effective oral dose in six patients with PLP-responsive seizures was 30 mg/kg/day (range, 7-38 mg/kg/day), which was significantly higher than the average effective pyri- doxine dose (18 mg/kg/day) in pyridoxine respond- ers.70 Because of superior efficacy in certain cases, PLP should be considered for first-line treatment of patients in whom a clinical trial of vitamin B6 is indicated. PLP should also be considered for patients with suspected vitamin B6-responsive seizures that are unresponsive to pyridoxine.

Vitamin B6 in Clinical Practice
Vitamin B6 should be tried in all infants and young children with intractable epilepsy. For children and adults whose seizures are well controlled on medi- cation, moderate doses of vitamin B6 (such as 10-50 mg/day) may be considered to prevent possible drug- induced vitamin B6 deficiency. Although larger doses



might be appropriate in selected cases, high-dose vita- min B6 appears to interfere with some anticonvulsant medications. In one study, supplementation with 80- 200 mg/day pyridoxine reduced serum phenytoin and phenobarbitone levels in epileptic children.71 In addi- tion, long-term administration of 500 mg/day or more of pyridoxine has resulted in neurotoxicity in some adults,72 which could presumably occur at lower doses in children.
One practitioner found that supplementation with 600 mg/day vitamin B6 reversed phenytoin-in- duced gingival hyperplasia in several patients; however, such high doses are probably excessive for most patients with epilepsy.73 Lower doses might be effective for phe- nytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia, particularly when used in combination with a folic acid mouth rinse (see below).
Patients being treated with vitamin B6 should probably also receive a magnesium supplement, in view of evidence that these nutrients work together and an- ecdotal reports that vitamin B6 supplementation in- creases the requirement for magnesium.

Magnesium
Severe magnesium depletion can cause sei- zures74,75 or increase susceptibility to seizure-inducing stimuli.76 Intravenously infused magnesium exerted an anticonvulsant effect against experimentally-induced epileptic foci in cats and dogs.77 In humans, parenter- ally administered magnesium is an effective treatment for the seizures of neonatal tetany78 and eclampsia and possibly for those associated with ethanol withdrawal and acute intermittent porphyria.79
Magnesium concentrations in serum and ce- rebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly lower in 40 patients with grand mal epilepsy than in controls.80,81 Serum and CSF magnesium levels fell with increasing duration and frequency of seizures. Oral administra- tion of magnesium has been associated in some cases with an improvement in EEG findings and a reduction in seizure frequency.82

Vitamin E
Erythrocyte or plasma vitamin E concentra- tions were lower in children with epilepsy than in healthy controls. Vitamin E levels were lower in children
receiving multi-drug therapy than in children receiving
single-drug therapy.83,84 In some studies, vitamin E sup- plementation reduced seizure frequency, although no improvement was seen in other studies.
Twenty-four children (ages 6-17 years) with treatment-resistant epilepsy were randomly assigned to receive, in double-blind fashion, 400 IU/day d-alpha- tocopheryl acetate or placebo for three months. Of the 12 patients given vitamin E, 10 had a greater-than-60- percent reduction in seizure frequency (of that 10, six had a 90-100% reduction). None of the patients in the placebo group had a greater-than-60-percent reduction in seizure frequency (p<0.05 for the difference in re- sponse rate between groups). Vitamin E treatment had no effect on plasma levels of anticonvulsant medica- tions.85
Thirty-five epileptic children and adults were randomly assigned to receive, in double-blind fashion, 250 IU/day vitamin E or placebo for three months. Anticonvulsants were continued as previously. Of the 12 adults receiving vitamin E, eight had a decrease in seizure frequency, two had an increase, and two were unchanged. Of the six children receiving vitamin E, two had a reduction in seizure frequency and four had no change. No changes were seen in the children and adults receiving placebo.86
In a double-blind study published as an ab- stract, supplementation with vitamin E reduced mean seizure frequency by 32 percent (p=0.03) in a group of severely mentally handicapped patients with treatment- resistance epilepsy. However, information was omitted regarding the dosage regimen and the response in the placebo group.87
In a study of 10 severely handicapped epilep- tic patients (ages 4-23 years) receiving anticonvulsants, supplementation with 100 IU/day dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate for one month had no effect on seizure frequen- cy.88
Forty-three teenagers and adults with uncon- trolled epilepsy were randomly assigned to receive, in double-blind fashion, 600 IU/day vitamin E or pla- cebo for three months. After a one-week washout pe- riod, each patient received the alternate treatment for an additional three months. Anticonvulsant medica- tions were continued as previously. The mean seizure frequency decreased by 25.7 percent during the placebo period and by 13.8 percent during the vitamin E period compared with baseline.89



Although the research on efficacy is conflicting, vitamin E is relatively safe and may be considered for adjunctive treatment in epileptic patients, particularly children.

Manganese
In rats, manganese deficiency increased sus- ceptibility to electroshock-induced convulsions. In ad- dition, hydralazine-induced seizures in rats were pre- vented by prior administration of manganese.90
In humans with epilepsy, whole-blood man- ganese levels were significantly lower by 20-41 percent than in controls.91-96 Manganese concentrations in epi- leptic patients did not correlate with seizure frequency or the type, dose, or plasma levels of anticonvulsant medication. Concentrations of other minerals, such as zinc and copper, were generally normal, suggesting that the association between manganese deficiency and epilepsy was not due to general malnutrition. Patients whose epilepsy was a result of trauma had significantly higher blood manganese concentrations than patients with no history of trauma,92 which suggests that man- ganese deficiency is a primary contributing factor, rather than a consequence, of epilepsy or its treatment.
One group of practitioners stated that unspeci- fied doses of manganese were helpful in controlling epi- leptic seizures.97 In a case report, a 12-year-old boy with poorly controlled epilepsy and a low blood manganese level experienced fewer seizures after treatment with 20 mg manganese daily. A dose of 10 mg/day was tried ini- tially for three weeks, but was not effective.91

Taurine
Taurine acts as a modulator of membrane ex- citability in the central nervous system by inhibiting the release of other neurotransmitters and decreasing mito- chondrial release of calcium.98 Taurine concentrations have been found to be elevated in serum, but decreased in the brain, of some patients with epilepsy. In contrast, serum concentrations of most other amino acids were lower in patients with epilepsy than in healthy controls. Taurine administration partially corrected these low se- rum amino acid concentrations.99-102
Taurine has been administered orally or intra- venously at a wide range of doses (200 mg/day to 21 g/ day) for varying periods of time to patients with severe,
intractable epilepsy. In some studies, a significant reduc- tion in seizure frequency was observed,103-107 whereas no benefit was seen in others.108 According to one report, taurine was effective against partial epilepsy but had lit- tle effect on generalized epilepsy. The beneficial effects of taurine frequently diminished or disappeared after a few weeks of treatment. One possible explanation for the loss of efficacy is that high-dose taurine caused ami- no acid imbalances, as suggested by the appearance of generalized aminoaciduria in a patient during treatment daily with 2.0-2.5 g taurine. It has been suggested that the optimal dose of taurine to treat epilepsy might be in the range of 100-500 mg/day, and in one report a loss of antiseizure activity was seen in some patients when the dose was increased above 1.5 g/day. While additional studies are needed to determine taurine’s optimal dos- age range, no specific dosage regimen has been shown to produce long-lasting improvement of epilepsy.

Dimethylglycine
Dimethylglycine, a metabolite of betaine, dem- onstrated anticonvulsant activity in mice in one study,109 but not in another.110
In a case report, a 22-year-old mentally handi- capped man with mixed complex, partial, and grand mal seizures had been having 16-18 generalized seizures per week, despite therapeutic levels of phenobarbital and carbamazepine. His mother began giving him 90 mg dimethylglycine twice daily because of a suggestion it might improve his stamina. Within one week his seizure frequency dropped to three per week. Two attempts to withdraw dimethylglycine resulted in a dramatic in- crease in seizures.111
In follow-up studies, administration of di- methylglycine to 24 epileptic patients in doses of 300- 810 mg/day for up to 30 days did not produce any im- provement.112,113 It was suggested that the one patient who benefited from dimethylglycine may have had an isolated metabolic defect that was overcome by treat- ment with this compound.

Thiamine
Severe thiamine deficiency can cause seizures in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic patients; these sei- zuresarereversiblewith thiaminesupplementation. Low



thiamine status was found in 25 percent of 620 epilep- tic patients attending an outpatient clinic in one study, and in 31 percent of 72 patients in another study.114,115 In a placebo-controlled trial, supplementation of epilep- tic patients with 50 mg thiamine daily for six months was associated with significant improvements in tests of both verbal and non-verbal IQ.113 Thus, suboptimal thiamine status may be a factor in the impaired cogni- tive function seen in some patients with epilepsy.

Folic Acid
Seizures occur in some infants with cerebral folate deficiency, a syndrome that also includes slow head growth, psychomotor retardation, cerebellar atax- ia, and other neurological abnormalities. This syndrome is caused by impaired transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system. The transport defect can be overcome by administration of folinic acid (an active form of folic acid), which bypasses the blocked folate transport mechanism. There are sev- eral case reports in which administration of folinic acid (2.5-20 mg twice daily in one study, 0.5-1.0 mg/kg body weight per day in another) resulted in improvement or complete control of seizures in infants.116,117
In patients with seizures not due to cerebral folate deficiency, folic acid supplementation is of little or no benefit with respect to seizure control, and may even exacerbate seizures in some instances (see below). However, folate deficiency is common in patients with epilepsy and may have negative effects on other as- pects of health. Subnormal serum or erythrocyte folate concentrations have been observed in 19-88 percent of patients with epilepsy in different studies.49,50,118-122 Low folate levels were found more frequently among inpatients than outpatients, and in those with coexist- ing psychiatric illness than those without psychiatric illness. Folate deficiency is due primarily to the use of anticonvulsant medications (e.g., phenytoin, valproate, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and primidone), which interfere with folic acid absorption.123-125
While correction of folate deficiency is de- sirable, administration of large doses of folic acid can decrease blood levels of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine,126-129 potentially interfering with seizure control. An increase in seizure frequency has been seen in some,130 but not all,131-133 studies in which high-
dose folic acid (5 mg three times per day) was given to drug-treated epileptic patients. In addition to interfer- ing with anticonvulsant medication, high-dose folic acid itself may be epileptogenic. Intravenous administration of 14.4 mg folic acid induced a tonic-clonic seizure in one epileptic patient, although other patients expe- rienced no adverse effects from 75 mg folic acid given intravenously.134 One woman with epilepsy had an in- crease in seizure frequency and severity after receiving
0.8 mg folic acid per day, which was prescribed because she was planning to become pregnant.135 A cause-effect relationship in this case is uncertain.
Based on these observations, modest doses of folic acid should be used to treat folate deficiency in epileptic patients. A study of pregnant epileptic women taking anticonvulsant drugs found that a folic acid dose of 100-1,000 mcg/day was sufficient to prevent folate deficiency and did not impair seizure control.136
Folic acid has also been used to treat phenytoin
-induced gingival hyperplasia. In a small double-blind study, use of a 0.1-percent folic acid mouth rinse for six months significantly reduced the severity of this condi- tion, whereas a placebo was ineffective. Patients used 5 mL of the mouth rinse twice daily, spitting it out after rinsing for two minutes (this solution should not be swallowed, as doing so would provide 10 mg/day of folic acid). Oral, rather than topical, administration of folic acid (3-4 mg/day) produced little or no improve- ment in phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia.137,138

Biotin
Serum biotin levels were below normal in 74 percent of 264 epileptic patients on long-term anticon- vulsant therapy.139 Low biotin levels appear to result from an acceleration of biotin catabolism by phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital.140,141 In addition, carbamazepine and primidone may inhibit intestinal absorption of biotin.142 Interestingly, dermatitis and ataxia, side effects of many anticonvulsants, are also ob- served in patients with an inborn error of biotin-depen- dent enzymes.
There is no evidence that biotin supplementa- tion interferes with the effect of anticonvulsants. To the contrary, correction of biotin deficiency might reduce seizure frequency, as suggested by the fact that biotin- responsive seizures have occurred in some patients with inborn errors of biotin metabolism.143



Vitamin D
Patients taking anticonvulsants are at increased risk of developing vitamin D deficiency, apparently be- cause these drugs induce liver enzymes that inactivate vitamin D.144,145 Rickets,146 osteomalacia,147 and low bone mineral content148 have been reported in drug- treated epileptic patients. The frequency with which these disorders occurred has varied widely in different studies, in part because of differences in sun exposure.
In patients with osteomalacia resulting from the use of phenytoin and phenobarbital, the amount of vitamin D3 needed to achieve positive calcium balance was approximately 975 IU/day.149 In patients with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels who were taking phenyt- oin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbitone, either alone or in combination, the amount of vitamin D3 required to maintain a normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D con- centration (15 ng/mL or greater) ranged from 400 to 4,000 IU/day, with 72 percent of patients requiring 2,400 IU/day or more.150

Essential Fatty Acids
Five severely mentally handicapped patients (ages 12-26 years) with more than 3-4 grand mal sei- zures per month received a daily supplement provid- ing 900 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 2.3 g doco- sahexaenoic acid (DHA), and 50 mg alpha-linolenic acid. All five patients experienced a marked reduction in both frequency and severity of grand mal seizures.151 In a double-blind study that included 57 adults (mean age, 39 years), supplementation with fish oil (providing 1 g/day EPA and 0.7 g/day DHA) reduced seizure fre- quency during the first six weeks of treatment, but the beneficial effect was not sustained thereafter.152
In contrast to the possible beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acids, the omega-6 fatty acids in evening primrose oil may have deleterious effects in some pa- tients with epilepsy. There are several case reports in which administration of evening primrose oil appeared to exacerbate or unmask temporal lobe epilepsy.153-155

Carnitine
Treatment of children with valproic acid, particularly in combination with other anticonvulsant drugs, reduced total and free carnitine concentrations
and increased plasma ammonia concentrations (a
manifestation of carnitine deficiency). Carnitine levels in patients taking anticonvulsants other than valproic acid were normal.156,157 A consensus statement by a panel of pediatric neurologists concluded that L-car- nitine supplementation is indicated for patients with symptomatic valproic acid-associated hyperammone- mia, multiple risk factors for valproic acid hepatotox- icity, or renal-associated syndromes; infants and young children taking valproic acid; patients with epilepsy using the ketogenic diet who have low serum carnitine levels; patients receiving dialysis; and premature infants receiving total parenteral nutrition. The panel recom- mended an oral L-carnitine dosage of 100 mg/kg/day, to a maximum of 2 g/day. Intravenous L-carnitine was recommended for valproic acid-induced hepatotoxicity, overdose, and other acute metabolic crises associated with carnitine deficiency.41

Vitamin K
A hemorrhagic diathesis associated with low prothrombin levels occurs in about 27 percent of infants of mothers receiving anticonvulsant medica- tion. Fourteen pregnant epileptic women received 20 mg/day vitamin K1 for two weeks before delivery. No hemorrhages occurred in the babies and prothrombin times were all normal at birth. The authors of this study suggested that vitamin K1 should be given routinely to drug-treated epileptic women near the end of preg- nancy.158

Hormones
Melatonin
In one study, 3 mg melatonin was given each night for three months to six children (ages 2-15 years) with severe, intractable seizures. The mean seizure fre- quency decreased from 3.6 per day at baseline to 1.5 per day during treatment (58% reduction; p<0.05).159 Melatonin has also been used in doses of 2-10 mg be- fore bedtime to treat sleep disturbances in children with epilepsy. Melatonin treatment was associated with an increase in seizure frequency in some patients and a de- crease in others.160-162
Because melatonin appears to have unpredict- able effects on seizure frequency, it should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.



Progesterone
According to one study, progesterone may be beneficial for women who have seizure exacerbations at specific times during the menstrual cycle. Twenty-five women with cyclic exacerbation of complex partial or secondary generalized motor seizures of temporal origin received progesterone lozenges (200 mg 3 times per day). Women with perimenstrual exacerbations received treat- ment on days 23 to 25 of each cycle; women who had exacerbations during the entire luteal phase were treat- ed from days 15 to 25 of each menstrual cycle. In both groups of women, progesterone was tapered after day 25 and discontinued by day 28. Progesterone was well toler- ated by 23 of the 25 women. Two women experienced asthenia and emotional depression, which resolved with- in one day of discontinuing treatment. Eighteen women (72%) experienced a decline in seizure frequency during the three-month treatment period, compared with the three months prior to therapy (p<0.01). Among the 23 women who continued treatment, the average frequen- cy of complex partial seizures declined by 54 percent (p<0.01) and the frequency of secondary generalized motor seizures declined by 58 percent (p<0.02).163
Conclusion
A number of different dietary modifications, nutritional supplements, and hormones may help pre- vent seizures or improve other aspects of health in pa- tients with epilepsy. Table 2 summarizes the strength of the evidence for potential nutrient and hormone interventions. Supplementation with specific nu- trients should also be considered for the prevention and treatment of nutritional deficiencies resulting from anticonvulsant drugs. In most cases, nutritional therapy is not a substitute for anticonvulsant medica- tions. However, in selected cases, depending on the effectiveness of the interventions, dosage reductions or discontinuation of medications may be possible.
Because much of the research on epilepsy management with diet, nutrients, and hormones is preliminary, there are few clear guidelines on when and how to use the various interventions described in this article. However, consideration of basic aspects of nutrition and metabolism should aid the clinician in evaluating this research and making rational clinical decisions.









For example, hypoglycemia should be consid- ered a potential triggering factor in patients who develop seizures in the late morning or late afternoon or when a meal is missed. Food allergy might be a contributing factor in epileptic patients who have other manifesta- tions of possible allergy, such as migraines, asthma, or a history of recurrent ear infections in childhood. A trial of manganese supplementation would seem appropriate for patients with low whole-blood manganese concen- trations. An empirical trial with vitamin E would seem reasonable for many patients with epilepsy, particularly children. Supplementation with magnesium (200-600 mg per day) and modest doses of vitamin B6 (such as 10 mg per day) for general nutritional support would also be reasonable for many patients, in light of evidence that a large proportion of the population has subopti- mal intakes of these nutrients.164,165 Larger doses of vita- min B6 could be considered for patients whose epilepsy is not adequately controlled by other treatments.

Presentation Transcript


Dr. Jeffrey Tucker Presents
The Program For Total Health


The gold standard is health span
Of American women ages 45 – 54
33% suffer from hypertension
32% have lower back pain
20% have elevated blood pressure
22% have knee pain
21% have neck pain
12% have shoulder pain
11% have finger pain


The gold standard is health span
Of American men ages 45 – 54:
30% suffer from hypertension
27% have lower back pain
20% have elevated blood pressure
19% have knee pain
15% have neck pain
13% have shoulder pain
7% have finger pain


American diet: about 72% of the calories in the average American's diet come from foods that were not consumed by our recent hunter-gatherer ancestors. Consider that 23% come from grains (20.4% from refined grains), 18.6% from refined sugars, 17.6% from refined omega-6 seed oils (corn, soybean, sunflower, cottonseed, safflower, peanut, etc.), 10.6% from dairy, and about 1.4% from alcohol. 
Cordain L, Eaton SB, Sebastian A, et al. Origins and evolution of the Western diet: health implications for the 21st century. Am J Clin Nutr, 2005;81(2):341-54.


The remaining 28% come from a marginal intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, and a substantial intake of domestic, feedlot, grain-fed meat. We know wild game is about 2% to 4% fat by weight, while modern feed-lot meat is 20% to 24% fat by weight. Essentially, this means we are eating unhealthy, obese animals.
Seaman DR. The diet-induced pro-inflammatory state: a couse of chronic pain and other degenerative diseases. J Manip Physiol Ther, 2002;25:168-79.


In short, our diet in America today consists of grains, sugars, omega-6 fatty acids, trans fats, and obese meat, and is substantially deficient in fruits and vegetables. The outcome of this pattern of eating is the typical inflamed, swollen-looking, overweight American, who is prone to osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, chronic pain, and other chronic diseases.

Bioimpedance Analysis (BIA)
A4556 BIA Electrodes (2 sets @ 15 each)
$30
Provides: Body composition, fluid distribution, phase angle
This test can be performed as often as necessary to document changes in body fat and lean muscle mass.


BIA may be used
To assess:
Body composition (estimate)
Fluid balance
Cellular performance (cellular health analysis)


Body composition - BCM
Loss of BCM (sarcopenia) is associated with a reduced quality of life, poor immune response, increased biological age, osteoporosis, and impaired healing.


Body Composition - BCM
It takes three times longer to accumulate BCM as to deplete it.
To increase BCM you must remove catabolic factors (stress, anxiety, sedentary behaviors, insulin resistance, etc.), increase protein calories, and introduce resistance training.


Trunkal Obesity/Central Adiposity
Waist Circumference
Waist to Hip Ratio


Vital Signs
BP
Pulse
Temp


Hypertension Staging
Pre-hypertension
Systolic BP: 120-139 mm Hg; diastolic BP: 80-89 mm Hg
Stage I
Systolic BP: 140-159 mm HG; diastolic BP: 90-99 mm Hg
Stage II
Systolic BP: 160-179 mm HG; diastolic BP: 100-109 mm Hg
Stage III
Systolic BP: 180+ mm HG; diastolic BP: 110+ mm Hg


Hypertension
Stress – Adrenal hyper/hypo function
i.e: addison/cushings or other adrenal tumor. Test with urine cortisol or 24 hour urine test for vanillylmandelic acid and catecholamines (severe HTN)
Renal function (U/A)
Congestive heart failure/atherosclerosis
Hyperinsulinemia
Hypothyroid
Lymphatic congestion
Drug interaction/reaction
Especially contraceptive pills, steroids, decongestants, appetite suppressants
Lifestyle
Alcohol, obesity, smoking, high sodium, lead toxicity (soft water), caffeine


Lab: Cardiovascular
Lipids, fractionated lipid profile
Hs-CRP
Fibrinogen
Homocysteine


Highly Sensitive C-reactive Protein
C-reactive protein – is an important independent marker for inflammation.
High levels reflect over activity of inflammatory cytokines linked to coagulation and vascular endothelium damage.
Evidence suggests that previous infection with pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae or Helicobactor pylori may act as an initiating trigger for this chronic inflammation.


C-Reactive Protein
Marker of inflammation, infection and cell injury
Aspirin’s reduction of MI risk appears to be related to CRP levels
CRP activates complement which injures the inner layer of blood vessels leading to constriction of vessels, arrhythmia
Strong predictor of the risk of future MI
Study of 2,037 healthy middle-aged men from the Quebec Cardiovascular Study:
105 first cardiac events during 5 years of follow-up lead to 1.8 fold increased risk of ischemic heart disease when CRP was at least 1.77 mg/L


hs-CRP
Is helpful in assessing risk for unstable plaque, myocardial infarction, and diabetes.
Elevated levels of CRP and IL-6 predict the development of type 2 DM. these data support a possible role for inflamation in diabetogenesis.
JAMA, 2001, Vol 286: 327-334


Diseases Associated With Defective Methylation Capacity
Atheroscelosis, coronary artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, stroke
Neural tube defects, spontaneous abortion, placental abruption
Cervical dysplasia, cervical cancer
Colon cancer
Cognitive impairment, depression, senility, Alzheimer’s disease
Osteoporosis, RA, diabetes


MTHFRMethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
MTHFR is involved in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine via the remethylation pathway
Polymorphism associated with increased levels of homocysteine and defective methylation


MTHFR – Intervention
Folic acid/5-MTHFR
Vitamin B12/Methylcobalamin
Vitamin B6
Roboflavin: precursor for FMN (flavin mononucleotide) (B6 to p-5-p), precursor for FADH2 (flavin dinuceotide), coenzyme for MTHFR
Betaine/TMG


Fibrinogen
Plays a key role in arterial occlusion by promoting thrombus formation, endothelial injury, and hyperviscosity.
Increased fibrinogen levels are seen with: smoking, oral contraceptive use, obesity, stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, and aging.
Higher risk: elevated fibrinogen with high total cholesterol or elevated LDL; elevated fibrinogen with high CRP.


Lab: Metabolic Syndrome/DMII
Glucose-fasting and two hour
Insulin-fasting and two hour
HgbA1C


Lab: Altered Endocrinology
Adrenal Stress Profile – salivary cortisol
Thyroid


Lab: Objective Goals
Total cholesterol – under 200
Triglyerides – under 150
HDL – over 50 (male) and over 60 (female)
LDL – under 130 (under 100 if blood risks are present)
Trig/HDL ratio – under 3.0
Adults 3+ screen for IR
Children 2+ screen for IR
Lipoproteins
A1 and B


American Cholesterol education program expert panel’s current policy on fasting blood triglyceride levels in adults:


How to Make the Program Flow
Where I begin with a new patient:
Initial consultation
Charting the Subjective Intake
Establishing the patient’s health goals to start their Lifestyle Change Program
Objective findings: ordering or collecting data
Review of findings (first or second visit)
Developing their unique program
Follow up appointments


Complete the Health Profile Questionnaire (HPQ)
Anyone scoring over 50 points total or 10 or more in any one section would benefit from a detoxification program.
Even individuals scoring as low as 25-30 will experience greater energy, clarity, vitality and find that nagging symptoms of unknown origin often get better.
Go to www.DrJeffreyTucker.com to complete this form.


The Initial Health Consultation
Subjective interview
HCP Prescription
Health History
Health Profile Questionnaire (HPQ)
Diet/Exercise/Sleep/Stress Diary
Client’s Health Goals
Assessing Readiness to Change


The Initial Health Consultation
Objective Data Collection
BIA and vitals
Review of Findings
Begin Education and Health Coaching


Lifestyle Change – How?
It takes 45 days to change a habit or incorporate a new one.


Diet Diary/Exercise log
Are you filling yours out daily?
Keep track of:
Everything you eat
Everything you drink
Your Activity/Exercise
People who self-monitor both eating and exercise behaviors, are more successful at reaching and maintaining their ideal weight.
The American College of Sports Medicine. (Med Sci Sports Exerc 2001 Dec;33(12):2145-56)


Portion sizes & eating frequency
Don’t skip meals
Skipping meals leads to increased production of glucagon & gluconeogenesis resulting in muscle loss
Eat frequently
3 small meals and 2-3 snacks daily
To maintain stable blood sugar and insulin levels
Use high quality meal replacement to:
Achieve frequency goals
Increase nutrient intake while decreasing calorie
intake
Do the body composition analysis to find out your body fat percent and lean muscle mass.


Identifying the clients that will benefit from this program:
Altered Body Composition
Sacropenic obesity
Weakness and Fatigue

Lifestyle Modifications and Preventing Disease
3,234 non-diabetic subjects with elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations were randomized to placebo, Metformin (850 mg twice daily), or lifestyle-modification program. Program goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. Initial average BMI = 34.
At average follow up of 2.8 years, the lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of progression to diabetes by 58 percent vs. the Metformin reduction of 31 percent (as compared with placebo).
Knowler, W.C. et al., Reduction in the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes with lifestyle intervention or Metformin. N Engl J Med. 2002. 346(6): p. 393-403


The goals of the diet are
Decrease insulin stimulation via dietary changes which decrease insulin release
‘Good’ (vs ‘bad’) carbohydrates
Fiber
Moderate protein
‘Good’ (vs ‘bad’) fat
Portion size & meal frequency
Increase cellular responsiveness to insulin:
Chromium Green tea
Lipoic acid Cinnamon
Magnesium


Definition of Glycemic Index
Glycemic Index (GI) is defined as the incremental area under the blood glucose curve in response to a standardized carbohydrate load. It is therefore an index of the blood glucose raising potential of the available carbohydrate in a food.


Obesity as an Inflammatory Disorder
Obesity reduces a lifespan by 8 to 20 years.
One of the most interesting discoveries of the past decade has been the recognition that the adipocytes produces inflammatory cytokines.
Obesity, therefore, may be viewed as a low grade systemic inflammatory disease.


What does the Adipocyte secrete?
Resistin is an adipose tissue-specific factor inducing insulin resistance linking DM to obesity.
Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitizing adipocytokine.
Adiposity is a form of chronic, low-grade inflammation.


Mid-line trunkal obesity (VAT deposition)
Cushingoid appearance –increased deposition in the visceral adipose tissue enhanced by increased levels of
Insulin
Glucocorticoids (cortisol)
VAT contributes to:
- Production of the release of TNFa, IL-1, IL-6
- Altered insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance
-Thyroid hormone activity alterations


LIPOPSUCTION
The New England Journal of Medicine June 17, 2004
Liposuction (avg of 20 lbs) did not significantly alter the insulin sensitivity of muscle, liver, or adipose tissue; did not significantly alter plasma concentrations of CRP, IL-6, TNFa, and adiponectin; and did not significantly affect other risk factors for coronary heart disease.

Inflammatory Cytokines, Hyper-insulinemia, and Atherosclerosis
A number of studies have domonstarted that increases in inflammatory mediators like IL-6 and hs-CRP are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.
Metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with the onset of endothelial dysfunction, which may explain why type-2 diabetes is a risk factor for atherosclerosis.


American College of Cardiology53rd Scientific Sessions - March 9, 2004
National clinical guidelines recommend therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) as a standard of care in the management of CVD risk factors.
The value of TLC in actual practice is often discounted by clinicians and health insurers who instead frequently turn to widely available pharmacotherapeutic agents.

Weight loss does not always lead to better health
“Weight and BMI do not evaluate body compartments and therefore do not reveal if weight changes result in loss of fat-free mass or gain in fat mass.”
J Amer Diet Assoc 2002;102(7):944-955
BIA is a reliable resource for assessing body composition and tissue differentiation.


Why body composition and BMI are associated with increased risks
Muscle mass is the #1 Bio-Marker of aging
Hence, the higher the muscle mass the greater the longevity
Important for preventing
Sarcopenia
Obesity
Heart disease
Type II diabetes
Osteoporosis


Body Mass Index
Commonly used index of body composition
Not useful for measuring percentage of body fat or lean body mass
Patients with normal BMI may have sarcopenia or sarcopenic obesity


One in every six of your patient’s children are now obese
The American Obesity Association uses a reference point of -85th percentile of BMI as overweight
-95th percentile for obesity
The American Obesity Association estimates that over 30% of America’s children can be classified as “overweight”

Developmental Origins of Health and Disease
As compared with members of the cohort in whom heart disease outcomes did not develop, those who were hospitalized for or died from coronary heart had relatively small body size during the first two years of life, then grew more rapidly through 11 years of age.
Developmental Origins of Health and Disease, N Engl J Med;2005:353(17):1848


Trajectories of Growth Among Children Who Have Coronary Events as Adults
On average, adults who had a coronary event had been small at birth and thin at two years of age and thereafter put on weight rapidly. This pattern of growth during childhood was associated with insulin resistance in later life. The risk of coronary events was more strongly related to the tempo of childhood gain in BMI than to the BMI attained at any particular age.

Clinical Importance of Obesity Versus the Metabolic Syndrome in Cardiovascular Risk in WomenA Report From the Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation
The metabolic syndrome but not BMI predicts future cardiovascular risks in women.
The prevalence exceeds 20% on individuals > 20 years of age and 40% of the population > 40 years of age.


Waist Circumference Predicts Metabolic Risk
Men with a waist circumference greater than 40” and woman with a waist circumference greater than 35” are at increased risk for metabolic diseases.

Omega-3 & Healthy Cardiovascular Function
Omega 3 EFAs from fish support short- term as well as long-term cardiovascular health.
“Our findings contradict the current belief in the medical community that increasing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids produces only long term cardiac benefits.”

Omega-3 and healthy body composition
Fish oil concentrates not only caused weight reduction in the mice but also appeared to stop the animals from gaining weight when given free access to food.
Additionally, omega-3 concentrate reduced the number of fat cells, especially in the abdominal region.
Researchers showed that concentrated fish oil increased oxidation of fat by activating genes that break down fat in the mitochondria and peroxisomes.

Omega-3s reduce “silent inflammation”A primary cause of chronic disease
Problem
75% of Americans may have “silent” inflammation
Underlying cause of conditions such as Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases
Solution
Increase EPA-DHA consumption (AA/EPA 1.5 to 3):
-Displace inflammatory compounds such as PGE2
-Increase formation of anti-inflammatory compounds such as PGE1
Reduce body fat; insulin increases stored AA which is pro-inflammatory


Omega-3 and healthy brain function
“People who eat oily fish or take fish oil supplements score 13 percent higher in IQ tests and are prone to healthier brain aging.”
“The results suggest that fish oil users have younger brains than non-users. The aging of the brain is being slowed down by a year or two.”
Dr. Lawrence Whalley (AM J Clinic Nutrition, 2004)
American J Clin Nut Vol, 80, no 6, pp 1650-1657


Omega-3 fatty acids and neuropsychiatry
“Epidemiological evidence suggests that dietary consumption of the long chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, commonly found in fish or fish oil, may modify the risk for certain neuropsychiatric disorders. As evidence, decreased blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with several neuropsychiatric conditions, including Attention Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder, Alzheimer’s Disease, Schizophrenia and Depression…”

Adult Attention and Focus may be aggravated by stress
Effect of randomized supplementation with high dose olive, flax or fish oil on serum phospholipid fatty acid levels in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Young, GS et al Reprod Nutr Dev. 2005 Sep-Oct;45(5):549-58
These data suggest that in order to increase levels of EPA and DHA in adults with ADHD, and decrease the AA/EPA ratio to levels seen in high fish consuming populations, high dose fish oil may be preferable to high dose flax oil. Future study is warranted to determine whether correction of low levels of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids is of therapeutic benefit in this population.


DHA and Psychological Stress
DHA deficiency has been shown to-reduce catecholamine production
-lower serotonin binding affinity
-reduce the number of synaptic vessels
Administration of DHA influences behavior and plasma catecholamine levels at times of psychological stress.
Hamazaki T et al: Lipids. 1999;34 Suppll:S33-7
Anti-stress effects of DHA
Hamazaki T et al: Biofactors. 2000;13(1-4):41-5.


Anti-Stress Effects of DHA
In a similar double blind two month study (study 2), we measured plasma catecholamines and cortisol of students (3 females and 4 males for the DHA group and the same numbers for the control) at the start and end of the study. In study 2 the students were under a continuous stress of final exams that lasted for two months throughout the whole study period.
The plasma cortisol did not change in either group, but the norepinephrine concentration was significantly decreased in the DHA group (-31%), whereas it stayed at the same level in the control group. These effects of DHA intake may be applied to people under psychological stress.
Hamazaki T et al. Biofactors 2000; 13(1-4): 41-45.


What about depression?
Severity of depression correlates directly with the AA:EPA ratio.
DHA deficiency has been shown to:
-reduce catecholamine production
-lower serotonin binding affinity
-reduce the number of synaptic vessels
DHA supplementation dramatically increases the number of synaptic vessels in nerves.


OB/GYNs are recommending EPA/DHA
Promotes brain and eye development
Encourages fetal weight gain
Prevents perterm labor and preeclampsia
Increases the nutritional value of breast milk
Stabilizes mood and prevent depression during and after delivery – “baby blues”


DHA Reduces Post-natal Depression and May Promote Restful Sleep
Without sufficient dietary intake, mothers become depleted of DHA and may increase their risk of suffering major depressive symptoms in the postpartum period.

What is a Medical Food?
A specific combination of whole food macronutrient derivatives, micronutrients and botanical extracts designed with a specific therapeutic goal in mind.


WHY SOY?
Healthy body composition
Insulin resistance
Favors “Good estrogen”
Body recognizes as safe, weak estrogen
Cardiovascular health
Bone health
Antioxidant protection
Cognitive function
Hot flashes, sweats, dryness, mood, etc.


I support the use of soy
Do to the large amount of reported safety and efficacy studies.
Its long history of safe consumption by Asian populations.
The FDA health claim regarding soy protein and its potential to reduce the risk of heart disease.
Substantial data regarding the benefits of soy in cardiovascular health, prostate health, menopausal symptom relief, and bone health as well as other important areas.


Understanding Soy
Soy has been consumes by Asian culture for thousands of years.
Soy is a legume that is so nutritionally complete that it sustained Eastern populations through drought and famine.
Composed of:
Protein - Carbohydrates
Fat - Fiber
Phytonutrients - Isoflavones
Other isoflavone rich foods include garbonzo beans and sprouts (Red Clover).


The Forms of Soy
Soy has been used and studied in various forms:
-Whole soybeans - raw and cooked
-Protein isolates - with balanced and unbalanced isoflavone content
-Balanced isoflavone isolates
-Single isoflavone isolates
The more imbalanced the isoflavones the greater the chance for negative affects.


Phytosterols and Human Lipid Metabolism
“Plant sterols have been known for several decades to reduce plasma cholesterol levels. These plant materials have been granted a health claim by the FDA regarding their effects in the general prevention of cardiovascular disease”.
Marie-Pierre


Soy & Plant Sterol Research
“At a dosage of 1.8 g/day, LDL Cholesterol concentrations were 11.3% lower in the plant sterol group, and cholesterol absorption efficiency was 56% lower in the plant sterol group.”
Am J Clin Nutr 2002;76:1272-78


Soy
“…Moreover, it has been estimated…that introducing 2 g of plant sterols daily might reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 25%...low dose of soy protein (8g) added in beta-sitosterol (2g) seems to be a practical and safe alternative for patients seeking reductions in LDL cholesterol (<15%).”


Effects of a Dietary Portfolio of Cholesterol – Lowering Foods vs Lovastatin on Serum Lipids and C-Reactive Protein
“In this study, diversifying cholesterol-lowering components in the dietary portfolio by use of a soy protein-based, plant sterol fortified diet was as effective in lowering LDL cholesterol as was the use of lovastatin…reductions in hsCRP were significant with this dietary regime”.
JAMA 2003;290:502-10.


Is soy beneficial for breast health?
Research is far from conclusive on this issue and researchers are urging women to be cautious
However, a distinction should be made between the clear benefit of soy protein for cardiovascular health and the inconclusive role of isoflavones for breast tissue health.


Does soy benefit menopausal women?
YES. The research shows a great correlation with reducing hot flashes and other menopausal issues by consuming soy products.
Consumption of soy protein containing isoflavones decreased the intensity of hot flashes.
The majority of studies in menopausal women have shown improvement of hot flashes following soy consumption.


Do soy products compromise male reproduction?
NO. Studies done with balanced soy isoflavones do not show negative impact on male reproduction.
Negative studies are done with one isoflavone or by injecting isoflavones directly into the blood create much of the negative concern on soy.
Genistein was shown in cell cultures to negatively impact human sperm’s ability to fertilize the female egg.
Only when plant estrogens are injected, leading to high blood levels are adverse effects seen in research animals.


Do soy products compromise male reproduction?
Four published clinical trials investigating the effects of soy isoflavone consumption in men and reported that there are no adverse effects of soy isoflavone consumption on sperm quality.
Consumption of isoflavone supplements at the level of 40mg daily had no effect on semen quality.
There is no evidence of increased rates of fertility disorders among the Asian population due to soy consumption.
Medical foods with soy deliver 17mg of balanced isoflavones per serving.


Should soy be used for prostate health?
YES. Research shows overwhelming evidence of the positive benefits in supporting prostate health without adverse effects.
Nagata C, Takatsuka N, Shimizu H, Hayashi H, Akamatsu T, Murase K. Effect of soymilk consumption on serum estrogen and androgen concentrations in Japanese men. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2001;10(3);179-84.

Does soy inhibit thyroid function?
Well designed human clinical studies have demonstrated that soy has a minimal effect on overall thyroid function in healthy individuals.
Ultrameal Medical Food Program: Containing soy protein (15 grams) with a comprehensive vitamin/mineral blend
Patients using the Ultrameal product had no change in their TSH levels after 10 weeks. Patients using the popular retail product showed a significant elevation (150% above baseline) in their TSH levels.


Does soy inhibit thyroid function?
Amounts greater than 200mg of isoflavones per day may inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis in susceptible people. (thyroid issues/low iodine)
Certain studies suggest that soy and soy isoflavones inhibit the production of thyroid hormones in individuals with thyroid issues.
Approximately 10 million Americans or 3% of the population have thyroid issues.
Alternatives to soy based medical foods are available for these individuals (rice and whey, etc.)


Is soy beneficial for bone health?
YES. Studies have shown that the isoflavones that are found in soy stimulate bone formation and reduce bone breakdown.
Soy isoflavones have been found to have a positive effect on bone health.
Isoflavones stimulate osteoblastic bone formation and inhibit osteoclastic bone breakdown.

Is soy beneficial for tissue health?
YES. Soy contains various beneficial agents for tissue health.
Cultures that eat soy have shown an improvement in colon and specific hormone-related tissue health issues.
Human trials involving post-menopausal women demonstrate a significant shift in healthy estrogen metabolism.


Isn’t it better to use a more complete protein?
Early studies suggested that soy was not a complete protein source. These early findings have been shown to be inaccurate.
Soy has the same “protein digestibility” score as egg white and milk protein.
Sarwar G, McDonough FE, Evaluation of protein digestibility-corrected aꎜnoacid score method for assessing protein quality of foods. J Assoc Off Anal Chem 1990;73(3):347-56.


Isn’t soy more allergenic than other proteins?
Soy proteins tend to be less reactive than many other food proteins. In fact, soy has been used as an alternative for infants with allergies to cow’s milk.
A meta-analysis of 17 studies of allergy patterns in high risk infants revealed soy allergy occurs in 3% to 4% of subjects versus 25% for cow’s milk.


Do I have to use fermented soy products to achieve therapeutic benefits?
No. The majority of studies around the world show beneficial effects of soy.

Blood sugar important points
“high fructose corn syrup,” which is simply a Pure fructose (what we use) is NOT the same as replacement for table sugar. Fructose is “natural” and is the typical carbohydrate found in fruits and sone vegetables.
The fructose in UltraMeal and UltraGlycemX is nutritive (ie, food) and is NOT used as a sweetener. It is there for its therapeutic benefit.
“Moderate” consumption of fructose is associated with POSITIVE blood sugar, triglyceride, and body composition benefits.


Blood sugar important points con’t
Data from animal studies use fructose levels far higher than a human would consume in a day – the equivalent of up to 700 calories in a day from fructose alone.
We have the clinical proof in numerous studies that moderate fructose consumption shows health benefits.
The obvious problem is poor diet – one FULL of empty calories from processed foods and beverages and NOT from a quality, balanced, meal such as UltraMeal or UltraGlycemX.


Definition of Glycemic Index
Glycemic index (GI) is defined as the incremental area under the blood glucose curve in response to a standardized carbohydrate load. It is therefore an index of the blood glucose raising potential of the available carbohydrate in a food.


Many factors affect GI of a food:
Carbohydrate type
-Simple: glucose, fructose, maltose
-Complex: amylose, amylopectin
Fiber content and type
Processing (the higher the processing, the higher the GI load)
Physical nature
Other macronutrients in food
-Protein
-Fat


Glycemic Index
The GI for a particular food is derived by expressing the individual glycemic index as a percent of a reference food, typically white bread or glucose.


Glycemic Index and Obesity
Low GI foods control appetite and delay hunger.
Low GI diets reduce insulin levels and insulin resistance.
High-carb, low-fat diets increase postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.
Several human studies found that energy restricted low-GI diets produced greater weight loss than did equivalent diets based on high GI foods.
Brand-Miller JC et al. Glycemic index and obesity. AM J Clin Nutr, 2002. 76(1): p. 281S-5S.


Glycemic Index and HDL-Cholesterol
Conclusion: dietary GI is a stronger predictor than dietary fat intake of serum HDL-cholesterol concentration.
Frost G et al. Glycaemic index as a determinant of serum HDL-cholesterol concentration. Lancet, 1999. 353(9158): p. 1045-8.


A meta-analysis of Low-GI Diets in the Management of Diabetes
14 studies that met inclusion criteria
Conclusions:
-Low GI diets have a clinically useful effect on medium-term glycemic control in patients with diabetes.
-The benefit is similar to that offered by pharmacological agents that also target postprandial hyperglycemia.
*Without drugs they get “similar” results on low GI diet

Glycemic Index


Glycemic Index of Selected Foods(referenced to glucose)
Watermelon 72
Pearled barley 25
White flour bread 70
Carrot 47
Cornflakes 72
Baked potato 85
Apple 38
Apple juice 40


Glycemic Load
The amount of carbohydrate often differs in a typical serving of a food.
A measure termed ‘glycemic load’ (GL) has been introduced.
(Salmeron J, Ascherio A, et al. Dietary fiber, glycemic load, and risk of NIDDM in men. Diabetes Care, 1997. 20(4): 545-50.
The dietart glycemic load is defined as the product of a food’s glycemic index and its carbohydrate content.


GL=(GI divided by 100) x available carb
Example: Watermelon (GL=4)
Glycemic index = 72. A typical serving (120 grams or ¾ cup) has 6 grams of available carbohydrate.
Glycemic load = (72 / 100) x 6 = 4.32 (rounded to 4).


Glycemic Load


GL=(GI/100) x available carb(available carbohydrate content of typical serving)
Example: Carrot (GL = 3)
- Glycemic index = 47. A typical serving (80 grams or ½ cup cooked) has 6 grams of available carbohydrate.
- Glycemic load = (47/100) x 6 = 2.82 (rounded to 3)


GI/GL Comparisons


GI & GL values of hundreds of foods have been determined

Effects of a Low-Glycemic Load Diet
“Resting energy expenditure decreased less with the low-glycemic load diet than with the low-fat diet…participants receiving the low-glycemic load diet reported less hunger…”
“Insulin resistance, serum triglycerides, C-reactive protein, and blood pressure improved more with the low-glycemic load diet.”
“In conclusion, we found that the physiologic adaptations to a weight loss diet thought to antagonize weight loss, involving energy expenditure and hunger, can be modified by dietary composition.”
JAMA 2004:292(20)2482-2490


High Glycemic Index Foods, Overeating, and Obesity
“Voluntary energy intake after the high-GI meal…81% greater than after the low-GI meal.”
Pediatrics 1999; 103(3):E26


GI Meals
“high-glycemic index meals produce an initial period of high blood glucose and insulin levels, followed in many individuals by reactive hypoglycemia, counter-regulatory hormone secretion, and elevated serum free fatty acid concentrations. These events may promote excessive food intake, beta cell dysfunction, dyslipidemia, and endothelia dysfunction.”
JAMA 2002:287(18);2414-2423


Fiber
Two isocalorically equal diets varying only in amount and type of fiber (50 g at 1:1 soluble/insoluble vs 24 g at 1:2 soluble vs. insoluble) for 6 weeks in non-insulin diabetes patients.
The high-fiber diet lowered the area under the curve for 24-hour plasma glucose and insulin concentrations by 10 percent and 12 percent respectively.
Chandala, M., et al., Beneficial effects of high dietary fiber intake in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. N Engl J Med, 2000. 342(19):1392-8.


FAT
High-monounsaturated-fat diets reduced fasting triglycerides (19%) and VLDL-cholesterol (22%), and caused a modest increase in HDL-cholesterol concentrations with no adverse affect on LDL-cholesterol.
No evidence that high-monounsaturated fat diets induce weight gain in patients with diabetes mellitus provided that energy intake is controlled.
Garg, A., high monounsaturated fat diets for patients with diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis. AM J Clin Nutr, 1998. 67(3 Suppl): p. 577S-582S.

Stress Hormones, Th1/Th2 patterns, Pro/Anti-inflammatory Cytokines and Susceptibility to Disease
“Acute stress might induce pro-inflammatory activities of certain tissues through the neural activation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone-mast cell-histamine axis”
Ilia J. Elenkov and George P. Chrousos


Cytokine Hypothesis of Depression
“There is growing evidence that depression can directly stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines that influence a spectrum of conditions associated with aging…”
Kiecolt Glaser JK et al. Depression & immune Fnction. J Psychomsom Res. 2002;53(4):873-6
“The ‘cytokine hypothesis of depression’ implies that proinflammatory cytokines represent the key factor in …depressive disorders.”
Schiepers OJ, et al. cytokines and Major Depression. Prog Neuropsycho Biol Psychiatry. 2005;29(2):201-17


Depressed Healing, Cytokines and Hostility
“Couples who demonstrated consistently higher levels of hostile behaviors across both their interactions healed at 60% of the rate of low-hostile couples.’
Kiecolt-glaser JK, et al Hostile marital interactions, proinflammatory cytokine production, and wound healing. Arch Gen psychiatry. 2005;62(12):1377-84
“Even a modest number of depressive symptoms may sensitize the inflammatory response in older adults and produce amplified and prolonged inflammatory responses.”

Balanced Biological MediatorsWith Personalized Therapeutic Lifestyle Change Programs
Dec. total load of HPA/HPT triggering factors
Reduce HPA/HPT hyper-reactivity
Improve detoxification of glucocorticoids and catecholamines
Improve cortisol sensitivity
Improve insulin sensitivity
Support thyroid hormone production, metabolism and tissue sensitivity manage cholesterol levels


Reducing stress hormones affects mood
Antagonizing CRF (corticotrophin releasing factor) and glucocorticoid receptors may be effective in treating depression.
Mechanism – interruption of reverberating neuroendocrine loops involving the HPA axis and several areas of the brain (prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus)


Obesity and moods
Obesity is associated with an approximately 25% increase in odds of mood and anxiety disorders and an approximately 25% decrease in odds of substance use disorders. Variation across demographic groups suggests that social or cultural factors may moderate or mediate the association between obesity and mood disorder.

Anti-Stress Effects of DHA
In a double blind two month study, we measured plasma catecholamines and cortisol of students (3 females and 4 males for the DHA group and the same numbers for the control) at the start and end of the study. Students were under continuous stress of final exams that lasted for two months throughout the whole study period.
The plasma cortisol did not change in either group, but the norepinephrine concentration was significantly decreased in the DHA group (-31%), whereas it stayed at the same level in the control group. These effects of DHA intake may be applied to people under psychological stress.
Hamazaki T et al. Biofactors 2000; 13(1-4):41-45


Consequences of Magnesium deficiency on the Enhancement of Stress Reactions; Preventive and Therapeutic Implications (A Review)
Mg deficiency intensifies adverse reactions to stress
Such reactions are mediated by excess release of catecholamines and corticosteroids
Low Mg and high Ca levels increase release of stress hormones, which further lower tissue Mg
J Am Coll nutr 1994; 13(5):429-446


MagnesiumMetabolic Syndrome & Inflammation
Mg intake is inversely associated with systemic inflammation and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in middle-aged and older women
Participates in reducing risks to top health challenges facing women: CVD, cancer, stroke, diabetes, obesity
N=11,686 women > 45 yo participated in Women’s Health Study initially free of cardiovascular disease and cancer and had no use of postmenopausal hormones


Stress Has Many Faces
Stressed & overworked
Stressed & tired
Stressed & wired
Stressed & inflexible
Stressed & hot
Stressed & cold
Stressed & depleted
Stressed & immune challenged
Disturbed sleep & mood


How Adaptogenic Herbs Buffer Stress Molecules and Protect the Nervous System
Non-toxic – no change in normal physiology
Helps the body adapt to stress
Normalizes body function


Plant Adaptogens
Balance the way your brain and endocrine system process stress thereby reducing the damaging effects of prolonged exposure to catecholamines and glucocorticoids
Increase the non-specific resistance of an organism without disturbing normal biological parameters
Act as a nootropic – a substance that enhances cognition, protects the brain and has low toxicity and few side effects


Disturbed sleep & mood
60 million Americans suffer from disturbed sleep, characterized by functional impairments during the day.
Today, the widespread practice of “burning the candle at both ends” in western industrialized societies has created so much sleep deprivation that what is really abnormal sleep is now almost the norm


Difficulty falling asleep
Difficulty waking up in the morning
Waking up tired
Microsleeps - very brief episodes of sleep, such as “nodding off”
“zoning out” in the middle of a conversation or task
Preferring a late bedtime – 2-3 AM and waking up late, around 10 AM
Preferring an early bedtime – 8 PM and waking up early, around 5 AM
Clumsy and/or slower reactions times
Snoring (sleep apnea)
Routinely falling asleep within 5 minutes after lying down
Waking up frequently during the night with difficulty returning to sleep
Expressions of sleep disturbanceswww.cdc.gov/niosh/stresswk.html


FDA Warning:Commonly used RX for sleep disorders can disrupt performance and be addictive
Valium
Dalmane
Ambien
Restoril
Halcion


Natural sleep cycle
Light sleep: Body movement decreases. Spontaneous awakening may occur.
Stage 1: dec. serotonin
Intermediate sleep: Most of the night is spent in this stage. Helps refresh the body.
Stage 2: dec. Melatonin
Deep sleep: Difficult to arouse. Most restorative stage, lasting 30-40 minutes in first few cycles, less in later cycles.
Stage 3 & 4: dec. Serotonin
REM: Dreaming occurs. Heart rate increases. Lasts about 10 minutes in first cycle, 20-30 minutes in later cycles
Stage 5: inc.Acetycholine, dec. GABA, dec. Dopamine


REM=Ergotrophic
On-line, engaged
Externalized
Hypermetabolic
Cholinergic
NREM=Restorative
Off line, Autistic
Internalized
Hypometabolic
Serotonergic and GABAergic
REM-NREM Balance


Neurotransmitters Involved in Sleep
Serotonin-NREM
Acetylcholine-REM
GABA-inhibits brain arousal centers, reduces REM
Histamine-stimulates brain arousal centers, “wake promoting neurotransmitter”


Healthy Sleep Hygiene
Create a relaxing bedtime routine:
Read a book
Listen to music
Practice a relaxation technique
Take a warm bath
Keep the temperature in your bedroom at a comfortable level: extremes can disrupt your sleep
Go to sleep and wake at the same time each day – helps to develop a sleep-wake rhythm that encourages better sleep


Healthy Sleep Hygiene
No daytime naps
Go to bed only when sleepy
Set a bed routine
Get out of bed if you are not sleeping. Get up after 15 to 20 minutes if unable to fall asleep.
Get back into bed only if you are sleepy.
Maintain a consistent wake up time, no matter how much sleep obtained.
Use bed for sex and sleep only.


More Ways To Sleep Better
Watch your diet – a heavy meal or spicy foods before bedtime can lead to nightime discomforts; fluids can require disruptive trips to the bathroom. A light snack can prevent hunger pangs and help you sleep better.
Eat no closer than 2 hours before bedtime.
Avoid caffeine (tea, cola, chocolate and coffee) and cigaraette smoking 4 to 6 hours before bedtime.
Have no more than one serving of alcohol consumed 2 hours or more before bedtime.
Exercise regularly – exercising in the morning or afternoon – at least three hours before bedtime, so you won’t get too revved up – may help you get a deeper, more restful sleep.
Larzelere M. wiseman P. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Prim Care Clin Office Pract 2002;29:339-360


Melatonin
Reduced sleep onset
Increased REM sleep compared to placebo
Effective in children and adolescents with ADHD and insomnia
Improves tinnitus
Improvement in behavioral symptoms in dementia patients
Cluster headaches


Melatonin
Short half life (approx 1 hour)
Metabolized by P450 cytochromes
Physiologic range between 8 to 3 mg
Modest decrease in sleep latency
Melatonin has thermoregulatory effects that assist in its sophoric effects, reduces core body temperature


Melatonin: Human Studies
Analysis of 17 different studies involving 284 pts; melatonin demonstrated reduced sleep onset latency, increased sleep efficiency, and increased total sleep duration (Wurtman et al. Sleep Med Review 2005(9);41-50)
Two randomized studies demonstrated increased REM sleep percentage (J Clinical Endocrinology 2004; 89:128-134)
Useful in patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome (Sleep 2005(10);1271-1278)


Melatonin: Safety
Generally regarded as safe with little risk of toxicity especially in short term use
Side effects may include fatigue and dizziness
High doses ( 8 mg or above) associated with reduced sperm motility
Should not be used in pregnancy or breast feeding
May reduce effectiveness in patients taking warfarin


Recommended Use of Melatonin
Administer 30 minutes to 1 hour prior to bedtime
Dosing varies by age
Administration of melatonin to older adults results in substantially higher blood levels “less is more”
Exposure to light will inhibit the sleep promoting effects of melatonin


Passionflower: Overview
Traditional herb used for its sedative and anxiolytic properties
Two biologically active flavanoids isolated; Apigenin and Chrysin which bind to benzodiazepine receptors
Both Apigenin and Chrysin reduce behavioral measures of anxiety in animals in a manner similar to benzodiazepines (Pharmacol Biochem Behav 1994, 47(1):697-706


What is Casein Tryptic Hydrolsate?
Pure tryptic hydrolysate from milk anxiolytic like profile (on label: “casein hydrolsate”)
Standardized to 2.2% casein decapetide with molecular mass 1267 Da, corresponds to the peptide 91 to 100 of alphas1 casein by enzymatic hydrolysis using trypsin
Can be concentrated or isolated by HPLC


Casein Tryptic Hydrolysate
Demonstrated to be efficacious for stress reduction using conditioned defensive burying test and elevated plus-maze in rats
Aids sleep
Helps to reduce cortisol
Helps to keep blood pressure levels within the normal range (modify)
Helps to control symptoms of physiological and psychological stress
Casein tryptic hydrolysate produces a noticeable effect in as little as one hour and optimal results can be observed after 10 days of treatment.

Dr Amy Hass Neurology Phyphyalogy of Subluxation 
Subluxation “A Misalignment of the spine of affects the function of the nervous system that lies within in”
My main reason that I’m correcting you is to help your body work better
1: Subluxation decreases nerve transmission therefore reducing the communication cycle between the brain and the body (Safety pin analogy)
2: Subluxation decreases cerebral oxygen perfusion and CSF flow: Normal curve (O2/CSF normal), Reversed Cervical Curve (O2/CSF)
2: Subluxation interferes with the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic – inhibiting ones ability to adapt to life’s stressors. PNS-------ANS-------SNS (subluxated state reduce ability to adapt)
4: Subluxation causes nociception which reduces the function of  mechanoreceptor
Nociception is NOT pain
Nociception is neurological input from malfunctioning or subuxated joints. If left untreated for some time, one will become aware of nociception = PAIN
Mechenoroception (nociception reduces ability to tell where the body is in space)
Nociception- Hypothalamus- Anterior Pituitary- Adrenal Cortex, NE/EpiN/ Cortisol – Stress – 
Lack of repair and regeneration = major problem. Over time, this cycle becomes
5: Subluxation causes decreased spinal movement which decreases input to the brain through the RAS (Spinal movement is the fuel for the brain)
6: Subluxation decreases HRV (Heart Rate Variability)  HRV is the ability to adopt to different stressors in day to day life (HRV is controlled by the nervous system)

RADIO RANDOM INFO (STUDIES)

osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT) might reduce AOM episodes and tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media (level 2 [mid-level] evidence)
based on randomized trial with high dropout rate and without intention-to-treat analysis
76 children aged 6 months to 6 years with recurrent acute otitis media (3 episodes in previous 6 months or 4 episodes in previous year) who were not already surgical candidates were randomized to routine care vs. routine care plus OMT and followed for 6 months
OMT treatments lasted 15-25 minutes and included gentle techniques on areas of restriction consisting of ≥ 1 of following
articulation
myofascial release
balanced membranous tension
balanced ligamentous tension
facilitated positional release
counterstrain treatments
19 children (25%) dropped out (13 in routine care only group, 6 in routine care plus OMT group) and were excluded from analysis
OMT associated with
fewer episodes of acute otitis media (mean group difference -0.14/month, 95% CI -0.27 to 0)
fewer surgical procedures (tympanostomy tube placement in 4% vs. 25%, p = 0.03, NNT 5)
no significant differences in
number of antibiotic prescriptions
speech awareness thresholds on audiologic evaluations

A meta-analysis of studies looking at the efficacy of physiotherapy or chiropractic care for the treatment of neck pain 
Although the quality of most studies was reported to be low, 
the manipulation studies had high quality. 
The study showed that treatments were effective in reducing pain, in improving cervical ROM, and improving ADL.

115 patients
Comparing, in a randomized trial, medication (Celebrex, Vioxx, or acetaminophen) to acupuncture and spinal manipulation over the 
course of 9 weeks in persons with chronic spinal pain (neck to low back included), 
profound superiority in chiropractic spinal manipulation. 
EXCEPTION acupuncture was found to be superior on the basis of NDI scores. 
The average period of chronicity was 
4.5 yr in the medicine group; 
6.4 yr in the acupuncture group; 
8.3 yr in the chiropractic group. 
After 9 weeks of care, 
spinal manipulation had achieved asymptomatic status in 27%, 
compared to 9.4% for acupuncture 
and only 5% for medicine. 
Over the course of the 9 weeks, 
9 from the medical group, 
five from the acupuncture group, 
2 from the chiropractic group changed treatment types.
In the follow-up study of these same patients, chiropractic management outperformed acupuncture and medicine (1714). 
Only 38.7% of the chiropractic group changed group membership vs. 53.3% and 81.2% for acupuncture and medicine

WELLNESS TIPS
The motions of daily life, if done incorrectly, can result in injury to the spine. The following tips can help you steer clear of that kind of pain and inconvenience and keep you feeling your best.
Sitting
Choose a chair that is firm enough to support you comfortably, and don’t slouch!
Sit with your feet flat on the floor or on a low footstool so that your knees are slightly higher than your hips. Sit firmly against the back of the chair.
Lay-z-boy chairs don’t bend where you do; choose a rocker instead.
Avoid crossing your legs at the knees, which can aggravate existing back conditions and interfere with circulation to your lower limbs.
Standing
Stand with your head level. When you have to stand in one place for long periods of time, put one foot on a 4-6-inch stool to help keep pressure off your spine.
Avoid wearing high heels if you are going to be on your feet for long periods of time.
Working at a Desk
Take frequent stretch breaks if you have to sit for a long time.
Sit with your knees at a 90-120-degree angle. An angled footrest may help you feel more comfortable.
Make sure your chair fits correctly. Allow for two inches between the front edge of the seat and the back of your knees.
Choose a chair that tilts back so you can rest while you’re reading what is on your computer screen.
Elevate materials or your computer screen to avoid neck fatigue.
Lifting
Avoid twisting and turning motions when you lift. If you have to turn to place an object down, step in the direction of the turn, don’t just twist at the waist.
Always bend at your knees, not your waist, when lifting anything heavier than 10 percent of your body weight (e.g., a child or heavy box).
When lifting an object, plant your feet about 12-18 inches apart, kneel or squat in front of the object, and lift as you straighten up. Be sure to lift with the big muscles of your thighs, arms, and shoulders, not with your back.
In some situations, it is difficult to lift correctly. Getting grocery bags out of the car is one such situation. The car bumper doesn’t allow you to bend your knees. Bring the bag to you first and then lift carefully.
When engaging in repetitive lifting, use good lifting form, take frequent breaks, and use equipment to help whenever possible.
To avoid tripping, be sure your path is clear before you lift the item.
Physical Activity / Household Chores
Warm up and cool down before and after physical activity like playing sports, raking, and gardening.
When working with hand-held yard equipment, make sure that the machine you are using has a strap. Place the strap over your head and shoulder on the opposite side of your body from the machine and switch the machine from one side of your body to the other as often as possible. Use electric rather than gas-powered machines whenever possible; they are much lighter.
When washing dishes, open the cabinet beneath the sink, bend one knee, and put your foot on the shelf under the sink. Lean against the counter for support.
When ironing, place one foot on a small stool or a book.
When vacuuming, put all your weight on one foot, then step forward and back with the other foot as you push the vacuum. Use your back foot as a pivot when you turn.
Using the Telephone
When using the telephone, avoid cradling the receiver between your neck and shoulder. Hold the phone in your hand or use speakerphone instead.
If you use the phone a lot, use a lightweight headset.
Switch hands frequently when on the phone.
Resting/Sleeping
Don’t use a sofa arm as a pillow or watch TV in bed with your head supported only by pillows; this strains your neck.
Avoid sleeping on a soft mattress or sofa.
Lie down in bed when it is time to sleep. Don’t sleep in a chair or in cramped quarters.
Sleep on your side with your knees bent or on your back with a pillow under your knees. Avoid sleeping on your stomach.
Use a pillow that supports your head so that your neck and vertebrae are level with the rest of your spine as you sleep. Avoid sleeping on two pillows.
Be sure to get plenty of sleep every day to allow your body to rest and recuperate.

An Introduction to Ergonomics:
An Active Approach to Workplace Safety
What is Ergonomics?
 The scientific discipline concerned with understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, methods and data to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance. 

Ergonomics means: “fitting the job to the worker”

From the Greek
Ergo = Work and Nomos = Laws

Source : International Ergonomics Association
What Are Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs)? 
WMSDs are also known as:
Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs)
Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs)
Overuse injuries 
They are soft tissue injuries which occur gradually

What are Ergonomic Conditions?
Disorders of the soft tissue – specifically:
Muscles
Nerves
Tendons
Ligaments
Joints
Cartilage
Blood vessels
Spinal discs

What are Some of the Symptoms of WMSDs?
Discomfort
Pain
Numbness
Tingling
Inflammation
Burning
Swelling
Change in color
Tightness, loss of flexibility


If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, make sure to see your physician or an occupational physician as soon as possible to determine the cause of your pain.


What Causes WMSDs?
Heavy, Frequent, or Awkward Lifting

Pushing, Pulling or Carrying Loads

Working in Awkward Postures

Hand Intensive Work

Vibration

Contact Stress

Risk Factors
Risk of injury depends upon:
Duration of exposure
Frequency of exposure
Intensity of exposure
Combinations of risk factors
Risk Factors for WMSDsHeavy, Frequent or Awkward Lifting
Heavy Lifting
There are only recommendations for the maximum weight a person can lift.
Frequent Lifting
A little more than twice per minute
Awkward Lifting 
Lifting above the shoulders, below the knees or at arms’ length
Risk Factors for WMSDsAwkward Postures 
Awkward Postures: Low Work
Bending                               Kneeling                               Squatting
Reducing Low Work
Raise and/or tilt the work for better access
Use a stool for ground level work
Use tools with longer handles
Alternate between bending, kneeling, sitting, and squatting

Reducing Reaching
Keep items within close reach
Design reach distance for the shortest worker
Remove obstacles
Use gravity feed racks
Risk Factors for WMSDsHand Intensive Work 
Hand Intensive Work 
Repetitive Motion
Hand Intensive Work: Highly Repetitive Motion
Making the same motion repeatedly can cause a lot of wear and tear on the joints being used, and if you don’t rest to allow time for them to heal, the damage can just keep building up.
Reducing Repetition
Arrange work to avoid unnecessary motions
Let power tools and machinery do the work
Spread repetitive work out during the day
Take stretch pauses
Rotate task with co-workers if possible
Change hands or motions frequently

Hand Intensive Work: Gripping & Pinching
A power grip is 5 times stronger than a pinch grip.

=
10 lbs.							         	2 lbs.			
Other Factors
Your grip strength decreases when you:
Bend your wrists 
Pick up slippery items 
Wear poorly fitting gloves
Have cold hands

Hand Intensive Work Combinations
RepetitionGripping or Pinching                                Bent wrists

RepetitionGripping or Pinching

Repetition
Risk of Injury Goes Up as Your Combine Factors
Recognition & Reporting Signs and Symptoms
Report signs or symptoms if:
Pain is persistent, severe or worsening
Pain radiates
Symptoms include numbness or tingling
Symptoms keep you from sleeping at night

Fingers blanch or turn white
Why is it Important to Report Signs and/or Symptoms Early? 
Acute injuries can easily become chronic injuries and can sometimes lead to disability, even surgery.
Early treatment save time and money.
It’s important for your own health to report symptoms as early as you can.

Getting Involved
Look at your job
Come up with solutions
Work with solutions
Take part in training
Take responsibility for changing the way you do your job
Help to make sure efforts are successful
Five Key Points to Remember
Ergonomics can help you on your job
WMSDs can happen in jobs with risk factors
Risk factors can be reduced and WMSDs prevented
Reporting signs and symptoms early is important
You can help your company put ergonomics changes into place

2
What is a Pitch?
3
A media pitch is a letter sent via email to an editor or journalist.

You can also pitch the media by phone with the same information.

Objective: Catch the editor or journalist’s attention.

The pitch serves as a teaser to pursue the pitch’s call-to-action:

Schedule an interview with the subject matter expert
Product demonstration
Contribute an article to the publication
Pitch Versus Press ReleaseWhat is the difference?
Differences? 
A press release can be published as is; definite format; conventional style.
A media pitch is a teaser of the story with some, but not all facts; less formal.

*Both can get you free media exposure.

Don’t feel comfortable writing a press release?
If you have something valuable to get out to the public, 
don’t let a press release stop you – pitch the media!
4
5
Crafting the Perfect Pitch
Personalize each pitch
DO YOUR HOMEWORK. There is no one-size fits all – tailor each pitch based on journalist’s beat
Beat reporting = specialized reporting on a specific topic
Example: Health Care
Include stats/percentages – the higher, the better
Reference someone else’s data to back-up your claims
Attach nothing

6
Crafting the Perfect Pitch 
(continued)
Provide plenty of lead time when pitching a story
Example: January is Cervical Health Awareness Month
Depending on type of publication you’re pitching (print, online, etc.), you will need to pitch in advance of the Awareness Month Topic.
Media Lead Times:
Daily newspapers – one to three weeks
Magazines – four to six months
TV Morning Shows – two weeks to two months
Online – N/A
7
Subject Line Formula
Draft 3-4 suggested subject lines.
Depending on your call-to-action, the following approaches are recommended:
Start subject line with key words
State the benefit
Make the subject line the pitch topic
Be straightforward – ‘Company X Acquired Company Y’
Get personal – plug in names, locations
Create a sense of urgency
F4CP Subject Line Samples:
- Prevent Opioid Misuse & Abuse Among Athletes
- And, the Best Kept Secret in Health Care Is...
- Got Pain, Veterans? Say NO to Drugs & YES to Chiropractic
- Nearly 20K Opioid-Related Deaths, What Are The Alternatives?
- A MEDIA MUST SHARE: Rise in Chiropractic Among Veterans

Pitch Example

Subject: Got Pain, Veterans? Say NO to Drugs & YES to Chiropractic

Dear FIRST NAME,
 
As Veteran’s Day quickly approaches, it is time to honor the life, dedication and HEALTH of those who 
have served our country.
 
Today, there are 68,000 veterans taking opioids to manage chronic pain.
(even though there is NO research to support the effectiveness of opioids for long-term pain relief)
 
What is effective (and drug-free) for pain relief, you ask? CHIROPRACTIC CARE.
 
The evidence-based, hands-on chiropractic approach is proven to yield improved clinical outcomes and 
high patient satisfaction scores, and best of all: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides 
services as part of the standard medical benefits package offered to all enrolled veterans.
 
I’d like to offer you an interview or contributed byline from experts of this topic, who would be more than 
happy to comment on the utilization of chiropractic services for veterans as an alternative to addictive 
and potentially fatal opioid medications.
 
Thank you in advance. I look forward to working together to develop an engaging and informative piece 
for your audience. 
 
Sincerely,
FIRST NAME
Pitch Your Story
START: Tell your story to your local 
      newspapers
Easier to obtain coverage – less 
      competition
Community-based = relevant
Pitch your story one of three ways:
Submit news/tip/story on publication website
Hosted submission box
RECOMMENDED: Build a media list -- Find reporter/editor emails
Managing Editor
Excel sheet
Pitch early AM – do not pitch past 3:00 p.m.
Following Up
Do not be discouraged if you did not receive a response on the first go.
THIS IS NORMAL.
Following up is your best friend; 48–hours time, 1 week is too long.

RULE: 
Follow-up by phone a couple days later, leave voicemail (media screens calls) and 
then send quick follow-up pitch to journalist/editor.

*If you do not receive a response after second follow-up, re-write your 
pitch and work a different angle to pique their interest.
10
Media Opportunities
11
If the media responds to your pitch and wishes to pursue 
the opportunity presented, GREAT job! 

If you offered an article or interview, here is the next step:

Article (also known as bylined/contributed article): Request word count and deadline to abide by.

Interview: Request reporter’s availability for a phone interview. Make sure your time zones are correct when coordinating for both parties. Send calendar invites with dial-in information.

Media Coverage
12
YOU DID IT! 
The interview occurred or the article has been submitted.

What’s next?
Follow-up with the reporter for an estimated run date.
Monitor for coverage.
13
Media Advisory
A media advisory is a brief document used to invite reporters to cover an event, 
such as a press conference, forum or rally.

*You can pitch media advisories in their complete form via email.

Format of a Media Advisory
Top left – write: MEDIA ADVISORY
Underneath MEDIA ADVISORY include date of event
Include contact information
5 W’s – WHO WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, AND WHY.
### - indicates end of the advisory.

Q&A
The Facts
Low back pain is one of the most common reasons for all physician visits in the U.S.
About 80 percent of adults experience low back pain at some point in their lifetimes. 
It is the most common cause of job-related disability and a leading contributor to missed work days. 
In a large survey, more than a quarter of adults reported experiencing low back pain during the past 3 months.
Recent LBP Study

New Infographics
Tips to Prevent Back Pain
1) Managing your caloric intake can be very helpful to ensure a healthy weight. Obesity is a common cause to lower back pain. 
2) Posture plays a role. Chin up, Shoulders back and down. Watch both your seated posture and your sleeping position all of which can impact your lower back.
3) Shoes can be a contributor to lower back pain. Orthotics can be beneficial should it be found that the arches in your feet are dropping.
4) Review the support of your mattress and pillow annually. December is a perfect time to give the gift of support to yourself and a loved one.
5) Poorly set up work stations can create unnecessary stress on your lower back. Be sure your work set up is ergonomically correct. 
6) Watch your lifting habits. It only takes once to lift improperly and cause months of pain. Lift using your legs and not your back will save you from injuring your lower back.

The Role of Chiropractic Care in Arthritis
A Natural Approach to Relief
Arthritis Prevalence
By conservative estimates about 54 million adults have doctor-diagnosed arthritis. 
Almost 300,000 babies and children have arthritis or a rheumatic condition. 
The most common type of arthritis is osteoarthritis which affects an estimated 31 million Americans.
The Cost of Arthritis
Arthritis causes more loss from work, more pain, and more dysfunction and alterations in the activities of daily living than any other human illness.
Do I Need a Doctor?
Most musculoskeletal problems that will heal on their own will do so in a 2 – 6 week period of time.  
Joint pain beyond this time frame requires evaluation and/or treatment.
The Chiropractic Approach
If treatment is going to be effective, it is essential for the treatment to be tailored to meet the patient’s needs, since every form of arthritis is different and each patient responds differently to care.
A doctor of chiropractic is a licensed practitioner trained to diagnose and determine appropriate treatment for arthritis.
Professional Help
In most states, only three health care professionals are trained to diagnose and prescribe treatment for arthritis:
The Doctor of Chiropractic
The Medical Doctor
The Osteopathic Doctor
What is Arthritis?
Arthritis is defined as inflammation of one or more joints. 
There are three Major Categories of Arthritis.
Degenerative (i.e. Degenerative  Joint Disease).
Inflammatory (i.e. Rheumatoid Arthritis)
Metabolic (i.e. Gouty Arthritis)
Degenerative Joint Disease/ DJD/Osteoarthritis
DJD is the most common form of arthritis affecting almost 100% of the population by the age of 65, although it starts much earlier in most people.  
It is due to mechanical breakdown of the cartilage leading to altered joint mechanics, spur formation and possible misalignment.  
It predominates in the spine and weight bearing joints.
Degenerative Joint Disease
Lumbar DJD
Cervical DJD
Knee DJD
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
Rheumatoid Arthritis refers to a systemic condition causing severe inflammation usually of the peripheral joints (hands and feet).
RA often leads to severe joint disease and destruction.
The inflammatory changes of RA may affect other parts of the body like the lungs.
The cause of RA is unknown.
RA is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting approximately 1.29 million people in the U.S.
Joints Affected by RA
The wrist and hand are commonly involved in RA.
Specifically the Carpals, Meta-Carpals, & the Proximal Inter-Phalangeal joints.
Other affected areas include the spine.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Gouty Arthritis
Gout is a metabolic disease due to an inability to completely break down a chemical called purine.  
This results in a build-up of urate crystals which are deposited throughout the body, often in or around a joint.  
It is the most common cause of metabolic arthritis, affecting approximately .275% of the U.S. population.
Gouty Arthritis
Gouty arthritis commonly affects the first metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the foot and joints in the hand.
Gouty Arthritis
Rheumatism
“Rheumatism” is an often misused term that describes various conditions that cause “aches and pains” to the soft tissues affecting approximately 12 million Americans.  
Its most common forms are myofascitis/fibrositis, tendinitis, and bursitis.
Myofascitis/Fibrositis
Usually a generalized musculoskeletal pain, stiffness and fatigue.  
Multiple tender spots or “trigger points” will be felt in consistent places.
Tendinitis/Bursitis
Tendinitis refers to inflammation of the tendons (connects muscles to bone).  
Bursitis refers to inflammation of bursa (sacs of fluid between tissues to reduce friction).  
This can be acute or chronic.  
X-rays may show calcium deposits in the involved tissues.
Is there a cure for arthritis?
Arthritis can not normally be cured. Instead, treatment revolves around management and prevention of further deformity and dysfunction.
Acute soft tissue rheumatism can often be cured.  A cure for chronic soft tissue rheumatism may or may not be possible.  
However, with a serious effort by both the doctor and patient, it can almost always be managed with great efficiency. 
Doctors of chiropractic are trained specialists in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis and rheumatism.

 What will a Doctor of Chiropractic do for my arthritis and/or rheumatism?
Patient Interview
The doctor of chiropractic will ask you specific questions relating to your health to begin the process of determining the cause of your complaints.
Physical Examination
Your doctor will inspect, palpate and measure the range of motion of your joints.  
He or she will perform a series of maneuvers (orthopedic and neurological tests) to determine the cause of your problem and to establish a baseline from which your progress can be monitored.
X-rays
X-rays are the modality of choice to make the diagnosis of arthritis and usually allows for specific differentiation of the various types of arthritis.  
X-rays also show calcification in tendons and bursae.
Laboratory Tests
Sometimes simple laboratory tests are necessary to determine the exact type of arthritis present.  
Some laboratory tests provide information about the current activity or progression of certain types of arthritis.  
Some forms or arthritis do not require laboratory evaluation.
Special Studies
Sometimes, your doctor of chiropractic may order special tests such as MRI, CT Scan, pulmonary function tests, etc., either to better determine the extent of joint involvement or to evaluate complications of the disease.
Treatment
Begins with an accurate diagnosis.
Includes good patient education.
Consists of both in-office and home care.
Requires a commitment by the patient.
In-Office Treatment May Include
Manipulation
Heat, ice, muscle stim, and/or massage
Exercise therapy
Ergonomic instructions
Activities of daily living training
Home Care May Include
Exercise
Nutritional Advice
Nutritional Supplements
Topical Sprays, Creams, Ointments
Supports, Braces, Orthotics
Weight Control
Don’t Delay
Successful management requires sincere efforts by both the doctor and the patient. 
If you, or someone you know, suffers from arthritis or rheumatism, please make an appointment with your doctor of chiropractic.
THANK YOU!

Chiropractic Care is a Family Affair
Attract Committed Patients & Families From Day One
Your Vision
One of the most common questions chiropractors ask is how to transform their practices from symptom-based centers for pain-relief to places of health and wellness for families. 
Implementing a Family Practice Vision and Consciousness is the first step you must take in attracting new patient families.
Your Mission Statement
Decide what your ideal practice would encompass, including the percentage of families you would like to take care of.
Make certain that members of your staff are in harmony with your mission, and enlist their help in the creation of an office "Mission Statement." 
This is a crucial step in establishing the environment: before you can create it you must determine what it is you wish to create.

Family Care Mission Statement  “To improve the health and well-being of our patients, their families and the community through chiropractic adjustments, education, and a continual commitment to excellence of care and service.” 
Family Consciousness Plus
Your “family consciousness” alone won’t be enough.

You must have the systems in place that will support the new volume it creates.

Your office staff and systems may be ready to handle one new patient,  but you must ensure that it's prepared for the sudden influx of five or 10 new patients when entire families begin to book appointments.
Family Practice Systems
It’s In the Systems
Unless you have the proper systems in place to support rapid substantial growth, your new patients will begin to disappear as quickly as they come in, and along with them, your resolve to implement the family practice vision. 
Communication Systems
The first procedure begins with the way that you communicate your practice philosophy to your new patients or potential new patients when they contact your office.
What you say in that introductory call will determine whether they make one appointment for themselves or an appointment that includes them and four other family members!
The First Call System
Have your C.A. ask this question every time someone calls: “Is this an individual or a family appointment?” 
You will be amazed at the doors that will open when you begin asking this one simple question. 
Immediately, it will convey that your office specializes in taking care of families, not just individuals.
Education Systems
Once you've “planted” family consciousness in your patients' minds, you must fertilize it so that it "blossoms.“
The educational materials that you hand out must emphasize the value of chiropractic, not just for symptom relief, but to enable the body to achieve the highest level of health for every family member. 
Invest in a Digital System for the reception area. There are a variety of great tools available to educate parents about chiropractic and children. 
Repetition, Repetition, Repetition
Don’t hand out your educational items just once. 
Set up a system so that once a week your patients receive something about the benefits of living a chiropractic lifestyle. 
Supplement chiropractic’s image in the popular media with positive educational information that gives people the "big idea" about chiropractic.
Time Systems
Set up your schedule to support individuals and families coming in all at the same time. 
If your current system is set up to see only one person at a time, then no matter how many new families you get in, you will be confronted with capacity blocks. 
Organize your time system and office flow to support multiple families instead of multiple individuals.
Marketing to Families
Begin With Your Name
Look first at the exterior of your office. 

If you're trying to generate a family atmosphere but your office sign says “Back and Neck Care Center” you will not attract many families. 

Choose an office name with the word “Family” in it and you will immediately alert potential patients as to the nature of your practice. 
Create A Family Environment
When people enter your office, they should be able to immediately recognize the fact that you take care of families and children. 

When creating the proper environment, everything from the furniture to the books on your shelves matters. 

As patients walk in, what is their first impression? 
A Child’s Eye View
The next time you visit your office, walk through the front door on your knees. 
See what it looks like from a child's perspective. 
Create a warm, friendly, family atmosphere - Use friendly colors throughout your office. 
Create a wall of photos of all of the children you have cared for. 
Children’s Area
One way to make sure that children feel welcome in your practice is to set aside an area for them. 

If possible, wall off a small section of your reception area. 

If it's not possible to cordon off a separate section, then place a child-sized table in a corner of the room. 
Children’s Quiet Area
Books and quiet toys  encourage children to congregate and separates them from the rest of the reception room. 
This make kids feel welcome and decreases the chance that noise will disturb other patients. 
No playing tag in the reception room stumbling over patients as they go!
Lending Library
A lending library enhances your office.
Include books that focus on family health issues and options, natural healing, chiropractic testimonials, and pregnancy. 
If you keep magazines in your office, include those that focus on the family, parenting, and natural health. 
Before displaying them, screen them for content and drug ads. 
Children’s Table
Add a children's adjusting table into your office. 
Place it in a location where patients will see it on a regular basis.
This one act will make a huge change in the perception of your new and established patients. 
It comes down to whatever you have for your "big" patients, have for your "little" patients as well. 
Family Care Marketing Systems
The Family Care Packet
Source:
Here is a high purpose strategy that can explode your practice and place you as your community leader in drug-free family healthcare. 
A Family Care Information Packet is a proactive, community friendly marketing tool to change the referral climate in your practice, and make your new patient flow more predictable than the weather!
Family Care Info Packet
The Family Practice Information Package communicates the value of chiropractic from birth through senior life with contemporary language and photos that your patients can understand and relate to their own life. 
Create a colorful folder including a cover letter from the doctor, pamphlets on chiropractic and families, articles on human potential and non-drug approaches to health.
This packet is one of the best strategies for predicting and controlling your new patient flow.  
Show and Tell
Anytime your patients mention a friend or family member who might benefit from chiropractic, give them a Family Care Information packet. 

Don't just send them off with it. 

Show them what's inside and teach them how to share the information with others. 

If you do it right, they'll actually be excited and full of enthusiasm when they hand it over to the people in their life.

Office Tours
Once a month invite parents to bring their children for a tour of your practice when you explain what a chiropractor does. 
Keep the tour brief – Don’t tax their attention span!
Let kids lie on a table or bounce on the stability balls.
Use a model spine and let the children touch it.
Office Tours
At the end of the tour, offer some nutritious snacks. 
Give each child a free scoliosis and spinal health screening.
Giving them a sticker with words on it such as “Chiropractic Keeps Me Smiling!” 
Let them know how much fun it was having them at your office and invite them to come back again.
Your Family Practice 
Genuinely Care
Marketing works when families know you care. 
Everyone enjoys being acknowledged and remembered. 
Remember what they did, what they are doing, and where they are going. 
Prepare, Prepare, Prepare 
Train your team to think a few steps ahead to make each visit special for every patient.
Out With The Old…
Most people decide to wait until they have the practice of their dreams to start doing the things they would love to do.

This is frustrating and can result in failure.

Redesign your office systems to accommodate a family practice and remove those that have been interfering with your ability to see multiple patients and watch your practice grow!
In With The New!
Implement those systems and procedures that will support your vision today and sustain it tomorrow.
 
Let your goals revolve around having the practice you envision by doing those things today that will set that vision into action.

WE ARE ALL IN TROUBLE (MOTIVATION)
Effects of Sedentary Lifestyle (i.e. Prolonged Sitting) 
Meta-Analysis. Sedentary time in adults and the association with diabetes, cardiovascular disease and death. (Diabetologia, Wilmot, et al., 2012) 
Looked at 18 studies involving nearly 800,000 participants  
Results: Higher levels of sedentary behavior were associated with: 
112% increase in the relative risk of diabetes, 
147% increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease, 
90% increase in the risk of cardiovascular mortality 
49% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality 
These results were largely independent of exercise. (i.e. high levels of sedentary behavior are still associated with higher risks, even if the person is getting moderate exercise.)




POSTURE AND LUNG CAPACITY 
As the head moves forward all measures of health status are significantly reduced.
Rene Cailliet, Director of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Southern California, concluded that forward head posture can add up to thirty pounds of abnormal leverage on the spine, reduce lung capacity by as much as 30%, which can lead to heart and blood vascular disease. 
He determined a relationship between forward head posture and the digestive system as well as endorphin production affecting pain and the experience of pain.

CAR ACCIDENT INJURY PREVENTION
CAR ACCIDENT INJURY PREVENTION
COMMON MISTAKES 
86 percent of families positioned the newborn incorrectly in the seat.
77 percent incorrectly installed the seat.
More than a third positioned the harness retainer clip too low.
69 percent of babies had a loose harness.
Two out of 5seats had an incorrect recline angle.
A third used the incorrect harness slot.
One in 5families installed a non-regulated seat.
44 percent of seats moved more than 1inch side to side.
Half of the seats that used seat belts did not have the seat belt retractor locked.
About a third had lower anchors that were too loosely attached.
Many used the incorrect seat belt path.
Many also incorrectly used lower anchors in the middle seat.
11 percent had twisted straps, which can decrease straps' effectiveness in restraining a child in a crash.

RISK FACTORS FOR INJURY
Risk for Acute Injury
 female sex
females weighing less than 130 pounds in frontal crashes
history of neck injury
head restraint below head's center of gravity (males and females); large topset
history of CAD injury
poor head restraint geometry/tall occupant (e.g., >80th percentile male)
rear vs. other vector impacts
use of seat belts/shoulder harness (standard three-point restraints)*
out-of-position occupant (e.g., leaning forward/slumped)
non-failure of seat back
having the head turned at impact
non-awareness of impending impact
increasing age (middle age and beyond)
front vs. rear seat position
impact by vehicle of greater mass (>25% greater)
crash speed under 10 mph
rear-struck occupant when the bullet vehicle has a longitudinally mounted motor
driver vs. front seat passenger
body mass index/head neck index (decreased risk with increasing mass and neck size)

Posture is LifeInfluencing Longevity through Postural Correction 
The Posture Connection
Posture has become one of the most overlooked aspects of good health and longevity. 
Research has shown a clear and direct connection between poor posture and diminished quality and longevity of human life. 
Spinal pain, headache, mood, blood pressure, pulse, and lung capacity are among the functions most easily influenced by posture.

Personal Experience
“You are only as young as your spine.”
Jack LaLanne, DC
Anterior Head Movement
As the head moves forward all measures of health status are significantly reduced.
Rene Cailliet, Director of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Southern California, concluded that forward head posture can add up to thirty pounds of abnormal leverage on the spine, reduce lung capacity by as much as 30%, which can lead to heart and blood vascular disease. 
He determined a relationship between forward head posture and the digestive system as well as endorphin production affecting pain and the experience of pain.
Imagine Your Head as a Bowling Ball
And your neck as the hand that holds that ball. Imagine letting the bowling ball sit in the palm of your hand with your arm tucked tight into your body.
 
Slowly move your arm away from your body while continuing to palm the ball. 

The weight of the ball will put more and more stress on your arm as it moves away from your body until the weight causes failure or injury to occur. 
According to Kapandji, Physiology of the Joints, Volume III
For every inch that the head moves forward in posture, it increases the weight of the head on the neck by 10 pounds.

In the example to the left a forward neck posture of 3 inches increases the weight of the head on the neck by 30 pounds and the pressure put on the muscles increases 6 times.

The British Regional Heart Study
As a part of the British Regional Heart Study scientists found that men who lost 3cm in height were 64% more likely to die of a heart attack than those who lost less than 1cm and that over the 20-year period of the study, men lost an average of 1.67cm.

That height loss was associated with a 42% increased risk of heart attacks, even in men who had no history of cardiovascular disease. 
Our Posture = Our Emotional State
We can tell a lot about a person from the way they carry themselves.

For instance, picture the way someone stands when they are feeling depressed: mid-back and shoulders rolled forward, head hanging, gaze focused on the ground.
 
Not exactly the picture of health. 
Yoga gurus have long said that it is impossible to be depressed with your armpits open.
A group of scientists led by Dr. Deborah M. Kado wanted to see if there was any correlation between postural distortion and a person’s health. 

They started with the biggest health problem: death. 

They asked: “Was there any correlation between a person having a hyperkyphosis and having a decreased life expectancy?”
Posture & Life Expectancy 
Dr. Kado reported in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society that persons with hyperkyphosis (hunched over – head and shoulders rolled forward) were two times more likely to die from pulmonary causes.

They were also 2.4 times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those without poor posture. 
The Frightening Long-Term Effect
According to a study from the American Cancer Society the amount of time you spend sitting can affect your risk of death. 

Prolonged periods of sitting have a negative influence on key metabolic factors like triglycerides, high density lipoprotein, cholesterol, and a number of other biomarkers of obesity and other chronic diseases.
Too Much Sitting Can Shorten Your Life
To live a long, active, energetic life, few things matter more than posture.
This quote by Thomas Meyers, Author of Anatomy Trains, says it all… “Movement becomes habit, which becomes posture, which becomes structure.”
Postural assessment and correction is the key in the majority of non-traumatic neck pain. 

It's not uncommon to observe 2" of anterior head placement in new patients.   

Would you be surprised that your neck and shoulders hurt if you had a 12 pound bowling ball hanging around your neck?  
Postural Assessment is KEY
From the Front: 
Are the points between the eyes, chin, breastbone, pubic area and midpoint between the ankles aligned?
Are the shoulders, hips and knees of equal height?
Is the head held straight, and not tilted or turned to one side?
From the side: Can you easily see the three natural curves in the back?
From the back: Are the little bumps on the spine in a straight line down the center of the back? 
Pair Up with your Partner and Check
Standing up straight is important for everyone, but at no time is it more crucial to develop the habits of good posture than in childhood. 
Many adults with chronic back pain can trace the problem to years of bad posture habits or injuries in childhood.
Because they are growing and more active, children may be at even greater risk for injury to the back and spine.
Check your friends and family when you return home and go to work tomorrow. 
Kids, Parents & Posture
THANK YOU!

4 Relationship Stressors
Money

Work

Children 

Spouses or Partners
Money
Can you really have too much?

I don’t think so! 

To little money can be a significant stress on a relationship.

Affluence brings with it an entire new set of even greater responsibilities and stresses.
Your Nest Egg
As a couple, commit to putting away 10% of what you earn every month.

And never touch it.

Your stress about your future will decrease in direct proportion to your increased savings. 

When it comes time to retire, you can live off the interest and leave the rest to worthy causes.
Work
Don’t be a workaholic.

Work to live, don’t live to work.

In ancient Hebrew, the words for work and worship are the same.

Work honors God. 

Organization and time management are the keys to reducing stress at work, and to creating time to honor your personal relationship.
Children
At each age, children bring their own challenges.

The “Terrible Two’s”

The “Terrifying Teens”: Between the ages of 13 & 18, many parents would pay dearly for someone to teen-sit. 

Troubled children are a special challenge.  The sooner you get professional help the better. 
Spouses & Partners
Could you write “the” definitive book about your partner? 

If you and your partner wrote a book about your relationship, the books would be so different that neither one of you would recognize the other’s.

“Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus” by John Gray, PhD


Communication
Be as specific as possible when communicating your needs with your partner.

What do you need?

What do you want?

Put yourself in your spouse’s shoes.

Is your request reasonable?

Can your needs and wants realistically be met?
It’s The Little Things
Gentlemen
Despite what might believe …
Dishes do not get up and walk to the dishwasher. 
Nor clothes to the washing machine.
And please put the seat down!

Ladies
Don’t mess with the remote control, the riding lawn mower, or his car!
It’s just the way things are!

Decrease commuter stress by leaving more time.  Listen to motivational tapes or inspirational music in the car.
Show That You Care
Send his or her favorite flowers. (Don’t assume they’re roses). 

Draw a bath for your partner. Surround the tub with candles & play soft music.

Give your partner a massage.

Go dancing. 

Surprise your partner with concert, theater, game, or movie tickets.
Week 3: Change Your Stinking Thinking
 If you exaggerate or catastrophize your life together, you may be creating much of your own stress.

2. Don’t have unrealistic expectations of yourself or your partner.

3. You may have been brought up with certain beliefs and behaviors and may unrealistically expect your partner to automatically know and embrace your ways.
Keep Moving On
When things don’t go exactly as you plan, is your tendency to get angry, judgmental, or noisy?

2. Do you internalize your feelings or blame yourself for being a failure at keeping the peace?

3. Let it go.  Don’t hold grudges.  

4. Leave past hurts behind and move on. 
Self Assessment
Before you look outside yourself for the source of your dissatisfaction, look inside.

2. Look in the mirror.  What you see is what you get! 

3. Looking inside will help you improve your outside reality.

4. What you send out is reflected back to you.
Everyday Acknowledgements 
When was the last time you praised, appreciated, and gave thanks to your partner? 

Everyone loves to be praised on a regular basis.  It’s a basic human need like fresh air.

Acknowledge your partner everyday by saying:
Thank you!
I appreciate you!
I’m proud of you!
I love you!
Week 4: Stop Giving Permission
Stop giving your partner permission to stress you out. 

Don’t let your partner pass along his or her bad moods on to you.

You are not responsible for someone else’s behavior, feelings, or mood, only your own.

You can choose not to be upset, angry or stressed just because someone else is.
Remember Your Armor
Avoid stressful situations by diffusing them beforehand.

Don’t greet your partner with “What’s wrong?” as soon as he or she returns home at night.  Agree to wait at least an hour before discussing the day’s challenges.

Don’t discuss sensitive subjects when you’re tired, or when you know from experience that they will cause an upset.
Goal Setting
Goal setting reduces stress by creating a roadmap or blueprint for the future, reducing fears and worries about what’s to come.

Set S.M.A.R.T goals for your:
Family Life
Spiritual Life
Physical Life
Mental Life
Financial Life
Rules to Live By
Anything your mind can conceive and believe it can achieve!

As a man thinketh, so it is!  Whether you think something is good or bad – you’re right!

Things are not necessarily right or wrong, they can just be different!
It’s Your Choice
Choose not to be upset by the little things, because most things are little.

Choose to decide when something is worth getting upset over.

Choose proactive thoughts and behavior aimed at self-fulfillment and happiness.

Choose to truly love, honor, and appreciate your partner.

The Truth About HeadachesA Chiropractic Approach to Relief
Are Headaches Normal?
Many people believe that it is okay to have headaches.

Some even think that headaches are normal.

This can be a dangerous misconception as headaches can be an important warning sign that something else may be wrong.
What is a “Normal” Headache?
“Normal” headaches are typically associated with a specific incident or stressful event.

If a headache goes away quickly after rest or sleep, it is a normal response.

Headaches that occur more than once per month or last longer than 3-4 hours are not normal.
The Burden of Headaches
According to a study by the Mayo Clinic, headaches are the 9th most common reason patients see a doctor.

The World Health Organization estimates that 50-75% of adults have had a headache in the last year and 30% or more have reported a migraine.

In the Global Burden of Disease Study, updated in 2013, headache disorders were the 3rd highest cause of years lost due to disability. 
Side Effects of Medication
Many people who regularly have headaches reach for medication to relieve the pain.

They often develop dependencies on these medications, which have harmful side effects over time such as stomach, liver or kidney problems.
There is a Better Way
Relying upon pain numbing medications on a regular basis for headaches is not justified if you know about the latest research and alternative treatments that are available to you.
Did You Know?
Over 70% of patients who use alternative therapies never informed their medical providers that they used such therapies?
	Eisenberg, DM. Ann 	Intern Med. 1997; 	127:61-	69
Common Headache Types
Migraine

Tension Type

Cervicogenic

Migraine Headaches
Contrary to popular belief, migraine is not just a bad headache. 

It’s an extremely incapacitating collection of neurological symptoms that usually includes a severe throbbing recurring pain on one side of the head.

It’s often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. 
Migraine Headaches
Female:Male – 75:25
Lateralization – 60% unilateral with sideshift
Location – frontal, periorbital, temporal
Frequency – 1-4 per month
Severity – moderate/severe
Duration – 4-72 hours
Pain Character – throbbing, pulsating
Triggers – multiple, neck movement not typical
Associated Symptoms – nausea, vomiting, visual changes, phonophobia, photophobia



What Happens During a Migraine?
The Efficacy of Spinal Manipulation for a Migraine
22% of the participants reported more than a 90% reduction of their migraines.
50% more participants reported significant improvement in the intensity of the migraines.
Tuchin PJ. A randomized control trial of chiropractic manipulative therapy for migraine. J Manipulative Physiol Ther 2000;23:91-95
The Efficacy of Spinal Manipulation for a Migraine
After one week of treatment 75% of the subjects reported complete relief of headache.
They also noted a significant increase in cervical ROM and a reduction of dizziness.

	Stodolny J. Manual Therapy in the 	treatment of patients with cervical 	manipulations for migraine. Aust NZ J 	Med 1989;4:49-51
The Efficacy of Spinal Manipulation for a Migraine
“Spinal manipulation was as effective as a well established and efficacious treatment (amitriptyline), and on the basis of a benign side effects profile, it should be considered a treatment option for patients with frequent migraine headaches.”

	Nelson CF. J Manipulative Physiol Ther. 	1998:2:511-9
Tension-Type Headaches
Tension-type headaches are the most common form of headache, occurring in about three-quarters of the general population. 

Tension-type headache is usually described as a pain that feels like a tight band round your head or a weight on top of it. 

Your neck or shoulder muscles may also hurt along with the headache.
Tension-Type Headaches
Female:Male – 60:40
Lateralization – diffuse bilateral
Location – diffuse
Frequency – 1-30 per month
Severity – mild/moderate
Duration – days to weeks
Pain Character – dull
Triggers – multiple, neck movement not typical
Associated Symptoms – occasionally decreased appetite, phonophobia or photophobia



The Efficacy of Spinal Manipulation for Tension-Type Headaches
Spinal manipulation is an effective treatment for Tension Headaches.

Amitriptyline was slightly more effective in reducing pain a the end of the treatment period but was associated with more side effects.

In addition…

The Efficacy of Spinal Manipulation for Tension-Type Headaches
Four weeks after the cessation of treatment, the patients who received SMT experienced a sustained therapeutic benefit in all major outcomes in contrast to patients that received amitriptyline, who reverted to baseline values.

And…
The Efficacy of Spinal Manipulation for Tension-Type Headaches
The sustained therapeutic benefit with SMT seemed to result in a decreased need for over the counter medication.

	Boline PD. Spinal manipulation vs. 	amitriptyline for the treatment of chronic 	tension type headaches. J Manipulative 	Physiol Ther. 1995;18(3):148-54
The Efficacy of Spinal Manipulation for Tension-Type Headaches
Almost without exception, chiropractic manipulation of the neck was found to be superior in terms of reducing tension headache frequency, intensity, and improving functional status of patients when compared to other standard medical treatments.

	Hurwitz. Spine 1996;21:1746-1760
Cervicogenic Headaches
A cervicogenic headache starts in the cervical spine—your neck. 

Sometimes these headaches mimic migraine headache symptoms. 

Initially, pain may begin intermittently, spread to one side of the head, and become almost continuous. 

Pain can be exacerbated by neck movement or a particular neck position (e.g., eyes focused on a computer monitor).
Cervicogenic Headaches
Female:Male – 50:50
Lateralization – unilateral without sideshift
Location – occipital to frontoparietal and orbital
Frequency – chronic, episodic
Severity – chronic, episodic
Duration – 1 hour to weeks
Pain Character – non-throbbing, and non-lancinating pain, usually starts in neck
Triggers – neck movement and posture, limited ROM, pressure over C0-C3
Associated Symptoms – usually absent or similar to migraine but milder, decreased ROM



Cervicogenic Headaches
110 participants with cervicogenic headache were randomized to receive both cervical and thoracic spinal manipulation, or combined mobilization and exercise. 
The findings indicated that manipulation was more effective at reducing headache intensity and disability. 
Additionally, the manipulation group experienced significantly reduced duration and frequency of headaches. 
	Dunning et al. (2016) BioMed Central 	Musculoskeletal Disorders 
Cervicogenic Headaches
Evidence suggests that chiropractic care, including spinal manipulation, improves migraine and cervicogenic headaches.
 
	Bryans et al. (2011) Journal 	of Manipulative and 	Physiological 	Therapeutics 
Headaches at a Glance
Chiropractic Care
Spinal manipulation has been proven effective for many types of headaches and it does not involve medication to cover up the pain.

Chiropractors are well educated in this field and can also diagnose the condition to recommend the most effective treatment, which typically includes exercise and nutrition.
Healthy Ergonomics
The Best Approach
If you have headaches be sure to check with a health professional for a thorough evaluation.

The best approach is to not develop the problem in the first place.

Take preventive steps:
Maintain proper body weight
Exercise regularly
Each nutritious food
Reduce stress
Practice healthy ergonomics
Maintain proper posture and spinal function
