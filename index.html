COURSE DISCLAIMER:  
The information contained in this course, was prepared by Dr. Paul R. Sherman and is 
being sponsored by the postgraduate department of the University of Bridgeport School  
of Chiropractic and does not constitute legal advice regarding interpreting plain fil m x-
rays. The information in this course represents some of the more common radiographic 
findings and disorders typically encountered in a chiropractic office. The radiographic 
findings and disorders in this course does not constitute an all -inclusive list and is not 
intended to replace any independent radiographic interpretation from a Diplomate of the 
American Chiropractic Board of Radiology ( DACBR) and/or medical radiologist. It is 
meant to assist the chiropractic physician in systematically interpreting  plain film x -rays 
of the spine and pelvis. It should be noted that prior to administering any treatment a 
complete case history, past medical history, family history and physical examination 
should be performed. In addition, if medically indicated additional radiographic and/or 
 
 
other diagnostic studies should be performed on all patients to determine if chiropractic 
care and/or adjunct therapies would be appropriate. If indicated, referral to a radiologist 
and/or other healthcare provider for consultation/evaluation should be considered.  
 
THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN INTREPRETING PLAIN FILM X- RAYS:  
Depending on the doctor, there are many different ways to evaluate and interpret plain 
film x -rays of the spine. Of utmost importance is that the doctor use some kind 
of  systematic approach when evaluating all aspects of the film. Here are some key 
factors to keep in mind:  
• Always have access to the appropriate clinical information, i.e.: case history, 
past medical history, family history, physical examination findings , age and 
gender of patient.  
• Identify the x- ray views taken, always have opposing views available, have 
prior films for comparison, and be certain films are of high quality.  
• Do a quick scan first and give your initial impression (normal or abnormal). If 
abnormal, does it appear to be congenital (something the patient was born 
with) or acquired (something that the patient developed over time)?  
• Always assess for osteoporosis (a condition that affects calcium in the bones 
resulting in loss of bone density and thinning of the cortex). Risk factors 
include: 
o   being female  
o   over the age of 50  
o   family history of osteoporosis  
o   physically inactive  
o   smoking 
o   taking corticosteroids  
o   low intake of calcium and vitamin D  
o   hormonal changes (menopause  or hysterectomy)  
o   chronic diseases such as kidney, lung, stomach and intestines  
Symptomatology varies depending upon loss of bone mass and complicating factors 
like osseous fractures.   There are three general types of osteoporosis:  
A. Generalized osteoporosis- widespread loss of bone mass involving the spine, 
pelvis and/or proximal long bones. (Might be post -menopausal or senile.)  
B. Regional osteoporosis -bone mass loss is restricted to a specific region or segment 
of the body (like part o f or an entire extremity).  
C. Localized osteoporosis -loss of bone mass limited to a small area (may be from an 
inflammatory arthritis, neoplasm or infection).  
 
 
Note:  Laboratory findings such as calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase are 
usually normal pr ovided there are no recent fractures. More accurate testing would 
include measuring specific biochemical markers (serum or urinary)  to assess osetoblastic 
and osteoclastic activity. These markers include bone formation markers (bone specific 
alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and procollagen extension peptides) and bone 
resorption markers (urinary pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline total and dialyzable 
hydroxyproline). . In addition, diagnostic testing can be utilized to assist in determining 
bone density levels and possible risks factors for developing osteoporosis and/or 
complications associated with osteoporosis i.e.; dual -energy x- ray absorptiometry 
(DXA). Keep in mind that DXA is not a 100% reliable test. There are many statistical 
factors involved in figuring out bone mineral density (BMD).  
• Identify and evaluate alignment and all bony structures, areas of cartilage 
(joint spaces), and soft tissue structures.  
• When done reviewing the films, stop and come back a few hours later to 
review the films again. This acts as a safety feature to double check yourself.  
• Always indicate radiographic findings (and diagnosis, if known) in the medical 
record.  
• Refer out for additional diagnostic studies and/or laboratory tests if clinically 
and medically necessary in order to further evaluate and make a proper 
diagnosis. 
• Always keep in mind the five radiographic densities —air, fat, water, bone, 
metal.  
• As obvious as it sounds, you must know what normal anatomy is in order to be 
able to detect abnormal anatomy. Remember, you are responsible for whatever 
findings are on the films.  
IMPORTANT MEDICAL/LEGAL ISSUES REGARDING PLAIN FILMS:  
In order to be able to recognize and interpret plain film x- rays of the spine, the 
chiropractic physician must have a clear understanding of norma l anatomy, normal 
radiographic variants, pathology and differential diagnosis in order to be able to detect 
abnormalities. While many of these skills were acquired during chiropractic education, 
clinical experiences and additional postgraduate training can further enhance them. Many 
medical mistakes stem from interpretations performed on poor quality films, relying 
solely on x- ray reports without reviewing the actual films, refusing to obtain second 
opinions when clinically appropriate, failing to refer a patient for additional diagnostic 
studies, neglecting to obtain and review previous diagnostic tests, or not performing a 
complete case history, past medical history or physical examination.  
It is critical to perform this type of systematic approach when interpreting plain film x -
rays. This approach is necessary to reduce the doctor's chances of misinterpreting the 
films and the risk of a medical malpractice action.  
 
 
 
 
IMPORTANCE OF A RADIOGRAPHIC REPORT IN THE PATIENT'S FILE:  
• Provides a means of documenting x- ray findings  
• Provides use for comparison purposes for previous or future studies  
• Provides a record of the radiographic findings if the films are lost or not 
available 
• Assists with communication with other healthcare practitioners and third party 
payers  
• Provides critical information which may alter treatment management 
• Provides information that may assist with future testing  
• Assists with patient communication  
• Medical legal reasons  
KEY COMPONENTS OF THE RADIOGRAPHIC REPORT:  
 
The radiographic report should include the following:  
• Author identification —At the top of the page, the doctor and/or practice name, 
address and phone number should be identified. This allows the medical record 
to meet the NCQA guidelines regarding appropriate  medical record keeping. 
To obtain full details of the NCQA guidelines, it is recommended that you 
login to chirocredit.com to take the course "Documentation 101."  
• Brief information regarding the patient —Name, date of birth (DOB), age, sex, 
C/C (chief comp laint) and x- ray study performed and views taken.  
• X-ray findings/Radiographic findings —The "ABC's" 
(Alignment,  Bone, Cartilage and S oft Tissue) (Please refer to specific sections 
in this course regarding a systematic approach to interpreting plain films of  the 
cervical, thoracic, lumbar, lumbosacral spine and pelvis.)  
• Conclusions/Impression—This factual section would include the most 
significant radiographic findings and diagnosis. In this section, appropriate 
medical/radiographic terminology should be util ized.  
• Recommendations—This section is used specifically to address any significant 
radiographic findings that may be of clinical concern and warrant further 
evaluation and/or follow -up testing.  
• Signature of doctor who interpreted films  
Note: As with all me dical documentation, the report should be dated.

COMMON RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES USED IN A CHIROPRACTIC 
PRACTICE:  
Diagnostic procedures should only be considered after a complete medical history and 
 
 
physical examination is performed and the physician determines that the diagnostic 
testing would be medically necessary.  
 
1. Plain film x -rays  are the most widely utilized skeletal imaging method. Plain film x -
rays are primarily used to rule out fractures , dislocations, anomalies or bone 
pathology.  They are also used in biomechanical analysis. The doctor should take into 
account  some  of the following guidelines for performing skeletal radiographs.  
 
Probable Indicators:  
• Trauma- both recent and hold  
• Assessme nt of joint instability  
• Unexplained weight loss  
• Night pain  
• Neuromotor deficit  
• Inflammatory arthritis  
• History of malignancy 
• Fever of unknown origin greater than 100°F  
• Abnormal blood finding  
• Deformity i.e.: scoliosis  
• Failure to respond to therapy 
• Medical legal implications  
Possible Indicators:  
• Greater than 50 years old  
• Drug or alcohol abuse  
• Corticosteroid use  
• Unavailability of alternate imaging  
• Unavailable, lost, outdated or non- diagnostic previous x- ray studies  
• Research  
• Systemic disease  
Non-Indica tors:  
• Patient education  
• Routine Screening 
• Habit  
 
 
• Discharge status assessment  
• Routine biomechanical analysis  
• Pre-employment 
• Physical limitations of patient  
• Financial gain  
• Patient recently exposed to high levels of radiation exposure  
• Pregnancy  
 
2. Digital Radiography - Indications for use are the same as for plain film x -rays 
(discussed in the first part of this cours e). Digital radiography is a diagnostic tool used to 
obtain osseous images without using intensifying screens and film. A digital plate is 
mounted in a cassette, which  holds a digital card. An x- ray exposure is still taken, but 
because a digital card is bei ng used, it requires less radiation exposure to produce an 
image than a traditional plain film x -ray would. The image is recorded on the digital card, 
which is then put through a reader. The reader converts the data into an image a t a 
computer workstation.   The digital image can be labeled and saved as the base image. 
With the computer, a base image can be modified in size, color, contrast, or it can be 
copied onto paper, email, or transferred to a CD.  
This technology has many benefits some of which are as follows: 
• Increase patient safety  
• Decrease patient exposure  
• Enhance film interpretation  
• Reduce the need for storage of film  
• Eliminate the need for a darkroom and all of its components and supplies  
To a small practitioner, this technology may not be cost eff ective. Since it may be too 
difficult financially for the small practitioner to have this type of technology in a private 
office, it is more commonly found in large radiology facilities, hospitals and teaching 
universities.  
 
3. Tomography  - Used to obtain specific images of anatomy and its abnormalities that 
are not accessible by plain film x -rays. It also enables the physician to obtain specific 
images of selected levels in the body by blurring out all structures above and below the 
selected level in quest ion. 
 
4. Radionuclide Imaging (Bone Scan)  - Detects skeletal metastasis, tumors, infections, 
arthritis, fractures (occult, stress and recent fractures), and avascular necrosis. Done by 
injecting a radioisotope intravenously and waiting to record areas of i ncrease uptake (hot 
spots). Brain, heart, lung, and kidneys can also be evaluated.  
 
 
5. SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography)  - A combination of 
tomography and bone scan. Evaluates areas within bone or areas where bones overlap 
i.e.: pars interarticularis.  
 
6. Myelography - Used to diagnose disc, vertebral canal (stenosis), spinal cord and nerve 
root disease. Done by injecting a water -soluble contrast media into the subarachnoid 
space.  
 
7. Discography - Evaluates disc pathology i.e.: degeneration, disc architecture, pain 
response and disc resistance to injection. Done by injecting a water -soluble contrast 
media into the disc under fluoroscopic control.  
 
8. Ultrasound -Primarily used to diagnose abdominal, pelvic and vascular disease i.e.: 
soft tiss ue masses (cystic or solid).  
 
9. Computed Tomography (CT -Scan)  - Evaluates the CNS. When evaluating the 
skeleton, it aids in detecting neoplasms, trauma, infections, metabolic disease and spinal 
syndromes. 
 
10.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  - Evaluates s oft tissues i.e.: discs 
(degeneration, bulges, herniations), ligaments (tears), muscle, spinal cord (tumors), nerve 
roots as well as bone marrow, joints, spinal canal and/or lateral recess, intracranial 
disease and CNS disorders i.e.: multiple sclerosis. I n addition, intravenous contrast 
(gadolinium) will enhance areas of increased vascularity i.e.: neoplasm, inflammation 
and scar tissue.  
Note:  When assessing for an active and/or inactive spondylolysis and/or 
spondylolisthesis the MRI scan should be performed using STIR (short -t-inversion 
recovery) sequences.   This will detect fat suppression thereby, evaluating the 
physiological activity in the area of the pars interarticularis.     
 
Note:  It is estimated that 20 -30% of patients without a history of pain have a positive 
finding on MRI revealing disc involvement. The doctor of chiropractic must keep these 
statistics in mind when assessing patients with positive findings on their MRI. In 
addition, disc disorders should always be correlated with the patient's cl inical picture 
(symptoms, history and examination findings). If this is not done the value of the MRI 
findings will decrease significantly. One should remember the annular fibers of the disc 
are pain sensitive and if torn, they can cause spinal pain and/or  leg pain. This pain can be 
caused from mechanical compression of the nerve root or from secondary inflammatory 
changes from nuclear extrusion. Whatever the cause, it should be determined so the 
patient can receive the most appropriate care. The chiropract ic physician should keep in 
mind the following terminology used to describe disc disorders, especially when 
reviewing the results of an MRI report.  
 
 
 
 
Three major categories of disc disorders:  
 
1. Bulging disc  is when the outer portion of the disc (the annular fibrous) becomes 
distorted and extends beyond the edges of the bony vertebral body.   
Note:  Bulging discs are usually the result of the natural aging process and 
commonly seen with disc degeneration.  
2. Herniation  is when there are radial tears of the annulus fibrosis that extend near or 
through the outer portion of the annular fibers.   Thus causing migration of the nucleus 
pulposus to move towards the tears and go beyond the limits of the normal disc space. 
Disc herniations have been further catego rized as protrusion and extrusion.   
a. Protrusion -focal area of the nucleus pulposus, which goes beyond the vertebral 
margins, but remains beneath the outer annular fibers and posterior longitudinal 
ligament (PLL).   In addition, the base of the lesion at its origin is boarder than the 
disc material beyond the disc space.  
b. Extrusion- focal area of nucleus pulposus that extends through the annular 
fibrous into the epidural space. In addition, the disc material beyond the disc space 
is boarder than base of the lesion.  
3.   Sequestration -is when extruded disc material has lost continuity with its disc of 
origin (a free fragment).   The free fragment can migrate away from its parent disc 
(caudad or cephalic).   It can also float in the canal and possibly become lodged at another 
spinal level.    
Note:  Special attention should be given when treating patients with disc disorders. Disc 
disorders might mimic a spinal cord tumor, especially if the problem has been 
progressing slowly. The doctor of chiropractic must exami ne the "disc patient" regularly 
for signs of progressive neurological deficits, which may indicate surgical necessity.  
In addition, disc disorders can potentially cause a cauda equina syndrome, which is a 
compression and/or compromise of the cauda equina. Patient presentation usually 
consists of complaints of saddle anesthesia, and/or recent bladder or bowel dysfunction 
(i.e.: urinary retention, increase frequency or overflow, incontinence, rectal or genital 
sensory changes, severe or progressive neurologic  deficits in the lower extremities and 
muscle weakness of the lower extremities and/or foot drop.) If a patient presents with any 
of these complaints or develops any of them following spinal manipulation, immediate 
referral for a neurosurgical consult should be given. The chiropractic physician should 
keep in mind that the cost of treating patients with disc herniations surgically is very high 
especially when combined with surgical costs, medications, MRI, rehab and disability. 
Cervical laminectomy could cost  $60,000 and fusion could increase the costs to 
$112,000. Lumbar laminectomy could cost  $83,000 and fusion could increase the costs to 
$169,000. Certainly, patients with disc disorders that are not classified as surgical 
emergencies can benefit from conservative chiropractic care with significantly lower 
costs and positive clinical outcomes.

X-RAY SCAN CERVICAL SPINE  
During parts three through ten of this course, it is important that the doctor keep in mind 
all the key factors previously discussed in part one under the heading "Things To 
Consider When Interpreting Plain Film X -Rays."  
 
X-RAY SCAN NEUTRAL LATERAL CERVICAL (NLC):  
Give it your first impression —normal/abnormal, congenital (something the patient is 
born with)/acquired (something the patient developed over time either short term or long 
term).  
  
Assess the ADI ( altantodental interspace). This is the space between the anterior aspect of 
the odontoid process and the posterior aspect of the anterior tubercle. This space should 
 
 
be no greater than 3mm in an adult and 5mm in a child. If the measurement is greater, 
consider the following possible causes:  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or any other inflammatory arthritide like AS, Psoriatic, 
Reiter's etc.  
  
Trauma to the transverse ligament (tear)  
  
Possible infection  
  
Agenesis of dens (If you suspect agenesis of the dens look at the anterior tubercle to see 
if there is hypertrophy of the anterior tubercle, which is usually seen with agenesis of 
dens or possible Os Odontiodium (failure of fusion of a secondary center of ossification 
at the base of the odontoid process).  
  
Down 's syndrome (Trisomy 21). 20% of patients with Down's syndrome have agenesis of 
the transverse ligament.  
Note:  Special Olympics require that the participants have a NLC performed to rule out 
the possibility of anterior translation of the atlas C1.  
 
Special Note:  Altantoaxial instability is commonly seen in Rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and is seen in up to 35% of the cases of RA when cervical 
involvement is present. RA is considered a connective tissue disease, cause 
unknown, that affects pat ients between 20- 60 years old,  more commonly 
females. If the onset is before the age of 16, it is referred to as  juvenile RA . RA 
classically affects the hands and feet causing soft tissue swelling which is 
commonly seen at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, known a s 
Haygarth's nodes. In up to 80% of the patients, it is the cervical spine that 
seems to be affected if and when the spine becomes involved as the disease 
progresses. Radiographically, RA is usually bilateral, symmetrical with 
juxtaarticular osteoporosis, uniform loss of joint spaces, marginal erosions, 
large pseudocysts, deformity and periarticular soft tissue swelling. Synovium 
usually becomes hypertrophied forming granulation tissue (pannus formation), 
which affects cartilage surfaces. Pannus formation u sually involves the bones 
causing erosion and cartilage destruction. Patients with RA who have cervical 
spine involvement many times also develop an increase in the ADI 
(altantodental interspace) a result of the pannus formation causing C1 to 
translate for ward (anteriorly). Laboratory findings typically reveal an elevated 
ESR, a positive RA latex (which is seen in 70% of the cases) and anemia.  
 
Certainly, one should differentiate RA from other common inflammatory 
arthritides like Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) , Psoriatic and Reiter's arthritis. 
For example, AS typically affects younger males 15 -35 years old, bilateral 
symmetrical fusion is common in the joints starting at the sacroiliac joints and 
ascending up the spine to the thoracolumbar spine, costal articulations and 
 
 
cervical spine. ADI may be affected. Laboratory findings reveal HLA -B27 
positive 90% of the time, ESR is increased in the active phase of the disease, 
RA factor is negative and CBC reveals mild anemia. Psoriatic arthritis affects 
males and females equally between the ages of 20 -50, skin lesions (psoriasis) 
is common. Radiographically, sacroiliac joints fuse bilaterally, but 
asymmetrical and DIP and PIP joints are affected. ADI may also be affected. 
Laboratory findings reveal negative ESR, negative RA latex and HLA -B27 
positive in 60% of the cases. On the other hand, Reiter's arthritis is caused by 
venereal disease (sexual exposure) and/or enteric (dysentery) onset and affects 
males between the ages of 18 -40 years old. . Patients may develop uveit is, 
urethritis and polyarthritis, a triad commonly seen with Reiter's arthritis. 
Radiographically, arthritis develops and affects the lower extremities, 
thoracolumbar spine and sacroiliac joint (usually unilateral fusion). ADI may 
also be involved. Laboratory findings reveal an increase ESR, negative RA 
latex and a positive HLA -B27 in 75% of the cases  
  
Assess the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies where the anterior longitudinal ligament 
(ALL) lies looking for the following:  
A. Thin vertical calcification along the ALL (referred to as marginal 
syndesmophytes). This is associated with Ankylosing Spondylitis, 
(aka Marie Strumpell's disease) an inflammatory arthritis. Clinically 
it is typically seen in younger males 15- 35 years old at a ratio of 1 to 
4 black s to whites. These patients tend to complain of achiness and 
stiffness of varying degrees usually involving the axial skeleton. In 
the early stages of the disease, complete remission of symptoms is 
not uncommon. Chronic prostatitis is associated in 80% of male 
patients. They may also have a decrease in chest expansion. 
Depending upon the stage of the disease, radiographically the 
patient may have an increase in the ADI, decrease in the cervical 
lordosis and fusion of the posterior facets, and IVD. The disea se 
tends to start at the sacroiliac joints and ascend up the spine and skip 
to the thoracolumbar spine, costal articulations and cervical spine. If 
multiple levels are ankylosed with marginal syndesmophytes, it is 
referred to as  bamboo spine  or poker spine . Lab findings: HLA -B27 
is positive in 90% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis, ESR is 
increased in the active phase of the disease, CBC reveals mild 
anemia, and RA factor is negative.  
  
B. Large flowing spurs along the ALL referred to as hyperostosis. 
These findings are usually associated with DISH (diffuse idiopathic 
skeletal hyperostosis), (aka Forestiers disease or Ankylosing 
hyperostosis). Clinically it is typically seen in males over the age of 
50 and may cause dysphagia and adult onset diabetes mellitus. The 
symptomatology tends to vary because joint motion is usually 
unaffected. Radiographically, it does not affect the posterior facets 
 
 
or IVD (no fusion) and usually the disc spaces are maintained at 
three or more levels. Lab findings may demonstrate  increased 
glucose levels (32% of patients diagnosed with DISH may have 
adult onset of diabetes mellitus). The patient may also have a 
positive HLA - B8, which is seen in approximately 40% of patients 
with DISH.  
  
C. Lipping and spurring along the ALL —horizont al projections of 
bone coming off the anterior vertebral bodies and/or posterior 
vertebral bodies —referred to as spondylophytes, exostosis or 
osteophytes and are usually associated with DJD, (aka osteoarthritis, 
or wear and tear disease). Clinically it is typically more common in 
females, ages 50 and up but certainly can be younger. These patients 
tend to complain of pain and stiffness with crepitus during 
movements of the joints. In addition, they may complain or present 
with swelling of the joints. DJD is  the most common form of 
arthritis. Weightbearing joints are usually affected. Vacuum sign 
(aka vacuum phenomenon) is an important early sign of DJD. It 
represents nitrogen gas in the nuclear and annular fissures and is 
seen radiographically as a linear radiolucency in the disc space. 
Extension tends to be the best view to create a vacuum sign. 
Vacuum sign usually indicates degeneration of the disc and 
indicates that intersegmental motion is occurring. Vacuum sign is 
considered a reliable plain film x -ray f inding to exclude the 
possibility of infection. Disc infections do not show a vacuum sign 
because fluid from the infection tends to collect in the fissures. As 
for the hands, the DIP joints may develop Heberden's nodes, or PIP 
joints Bouchard's nodes.   This is different from RA, which affects 
the MCP joints causing Haygarths nodes. As a general rule with 
DJD, radiographically the joints are affected asymmetrically with 
nonuniform loss of joint space. Depending upon the stage of the 
arthritis, osteophytic fo rmation and subchondral sclerosis can be 
present as well as subchondral cysts and degenerative subluxations. 
Lab findings with DJD are usually normal. The following findings 
in the spine are typical of DJD.  
Lipping/spurring anterior and/or posterior vertebral body  
Decreased disc space or height  
Subchondral sclerosis at vertebral endplates Note: The most common cause of IVF 
encroachment is hypertrophy of the joints of Von Luschka (aka uncovertebral) joints.  
Assess the anterior vertebral bodies for compression and/or avulsion fractures many 
times caused from a hyperflexion/hyperextension type injury.  
  
 
 
Assess the dens and check the density of the dens, which should appear approximately 
twice as dense as C2 body. The reason for this is the lateral masses and de ns are thicker 
structures than C2 body and tend to appear more opaque or whiter than C2 body. Also, 
assess the height and alignment of the dens looking for any lucency at the base and/or tip.  
 
If there is any lucency at the base of the dens consider the fo llowing possibilities: 
Jagged line -Fracture at the base of the dens  
Smooth line (thick lucency) - Os Odontoidium (failure of fusion of a 
secondary center of ossification at the base of the dens)  
No dens - Agenesis of the dens)  
Malposition of C1 (mock defect)  superimposed structures giving 
you the appearance that there is a lucency, but really there is not.  
 
If there is any lucency at the tip of the dens consider the following 
possibilities:  
Jagged line - Fracture at the tip of the dens  
Smooth line - Os Terminale (failure of fusion of a secondary center 
of ossification at the tip of the dens)  
 
Assess the vertebral bodies, transverse processes (TVP's) and disc spaces to look for any 
fractures, DJD, increased and/or decreased densities, and block vertebrae. If a 
compression fracture of the vertebral body is suspected, look to see if it is the anterior or 
posterior vertebral body that is compressed. If the anterior vertebral body is compressed, 
it is most likely from trauma and/or osteoporosis. If the posterior verte bral body is 
compressed, this is usually not a good sign and may indicate the possibility of some kind 
of osteolytic disease. An increase in density of the vertebral body may indicate some kind 
of blastic disease. A decrease in density of the vertebral bod y may indicate possible lytic 
disease. If there is an ivory (or opaque) vertebra consider the following possible causes:  
Hodgkin's Lymphoma - Radiographically, this type of lymphoma can cause an ivory 
vertebra with scalloping both anteriorly and laterally due to the lymph node tissue 
pressing on the vertebral body.   Note: Hodgkin's disease tends to affect younger patients 
20-40 years old.  
Pagets - Radiographically, Pagets  can cause an ivory vertebra to develop with expansion 
and thickening of the cortex of the vertebra.   Note: Paget's disease tends to affect patients 
over the age of 50 and laboratory findings usually reveal an increase in alkaline 
phosphatase. 
Osteoblastic disease - Radiographically it can cause an ivory vertebra with anterior 
concavity of the vertebra and no cortical thickening.  
Note: Osteoblastic disease is the most common cause of an ivory vertebra.   Osteoblastic 
disease tends to affect patients over the age of 50 and laboratory findings usually reveal 
an increase in acid phosphatase.  
 
 
Degenerative sclerosis  or osteomyelitis  
 
Note:  Degenerative sclerosis tends to affect patients over the age of 50 and laboratory 
findings are usually normal.  
 
Osteomyelitis tends to affect younger patients between the ages of 2- 12 years old. 
Laboratory findings  may reveal increase in white blood cells and an increase in the ESR 
and CRP. The patient may also have a fever do to the infection.  
Assess for any block vertebra. If a block vertebra is suspected, consider one of the 
following: 
Synostosis (congenital) -typical radiographic appearance is a C -
shaped anterior body, (aka wasp waist vertebra), patent IVF (from 
fusion of the posterior facets) and a rudimentary disc.  
Ankylosis (pathological) -typical radiographic findings include 
severe decrease disc height from DJ D (fusion), facet joint sclerosis 
and osteophytosis.  
Arthodesis (surgical) -radiographically, there is no C -shaped anterior 
body, rudimentary disc or patent IVF. There also may be a lack of 
lamina or spinous processes because of surgery (a result of a 
lamin ectomy).  
Note: When there are multiple block vertebrae at two or more 
segments in the cervical and upper thoracic spine, along with the 
presence of a scoliosis and development of an anomalous rib, it is 
considered classic radiographic findings for a condition known 
as Klippel- Feil Syndrome . In addition, if there is a congenital 
failure of lowering of the scapula (sometimes referred to 
as congenital elevation of the scapula) along with these other 
radiographic findings, the condition is referred to as  Spreng le's 
deformity . This finding of scapula elevation is seen in 20- 25% of 
the cases of Klippel -Feil Syndrome. It should be noted that 
Sprengle's deformity could occur as a separate entity. In addition, 
30-40% of the cases of Sprengle's deformity tend to devel op 
omovertebral bone, which is cartilage or fibrous tissue extending 
from C5 or C6 spinous process, lamina or transverse process to the 
superior angle of the scapula. The scapula is usually hypoplastic and 
patients with Sprengle's deformity many times have  an associated 
scoliosis, hemivertebrae, block vertebrae, spina bifida occulta or 
cervical ribs.  
Assess the cervical curve for hyper, hypolordotic curve, or military neck (straight neck). 
Several methods are available to determine the cervical lordosis. Fo r the purposes of this 
course, Angle of Cervical Curve will be discussed:  
 
Two lines are drawn, one parallel to the inferior endplate of C7 vertebral body and the 
other through the midpoints of the anterior and posterior tubercles of C1. Perpendicular 
 
 
lines are then drawn to the point of intersection and the angle is measured. Normal 
measurement is 40 degrees with a minimum of 35 and a maximum of 45 degrees. A 
hypolordotic or reversed curve can be caused by trauma, muscle spasm and/or 
degenerative spondylosis. In addition, assess the posterior vertebral bodies to see if there 
is any break in George's line. This line is drawn at the posterior aspect of the vertebral 
bodies. A positive finding may indicate the possibility of an anterolisthesis, retrolisthesis,  
spondylolisthesis, fracture, dislocation, DJD or ligamentous laxity 
Assess the posterior arch for any lucency and/or agenesis. If there is agenesis of the 
posterior arch of C1, always look at C2 spinous process, which  usually becomes enlarged 
and is known as megaspinous process. Also, look at the anterior tubercle/arch for any 
hypertrophy, which is usually caused from stress. It should be noted that complete or 
partial agenesis of the posterior arch is rare. Assess the space between CO/C1 and C1/C2, 
which should be approximately equal. Be concerned with gross differences. If there is a 
gross difference between CO/C1 it may indicate occipitalization (aka assimilation), 
which can be caused from a bone softening disease like Pagets or Fibrous dysplasia or 
possibly from patient positioning. If you are unsure, take a flexion view to see if there is 
any opening of the spaces between CO/C1 and/or C1/C2. If you suspect a problem at 
CO/C1, you can evaluate by using Chamberlin's line and McGregor's line.  
A. McGregor's li ne (#1 method) - a line is drawn from posterior 
superior hard palate to inferior surface of occiput. Tip of dens 
should not be above line more than 8mm for men and 10mm for 
women. If positive finding, may possibly indicate basilar 
invagination/impression. 
B. Chamberlin's line - a line is drawn from the posterior hard palate to 
posterior aspect of foramen Magnum. Tip of dens should not extend 
more than 7mm above line. If it does, it may indicate a congenital 
problem or bone softening disease like Pagets or Fibrous dysplasia.  
Assess if there is any calcification of the atlanto -occiptial ligament, which indicates 
Posticus Ponticus, (aka Pons Posticus, Posterior Ponticle, Foramen Arcuale, or Kimmerly 
Anomaly).Many times this calcification forms a foramen called the a rcuate foramen for 
the passage of the vertebral artery and first cervical nerve. Note: This radiographic 
finding may possibly be a contraindication to cervical manipulation because of possible 
vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  
Assess the posterior elements -pedicles, articular pillars, superior and inferior facets (aka 
zygapophysis), lamina and spinous process. In addition, assess the posterior cervical line 
(lamina/spinous junction). If you do not see a fusion line, it may indicate a spina bifida 
occulta (fail ure of fusion of a secondary center of ossification). Pay special attention to 
the alignment of the posterior cervical line with reference to the other segments. If the 
alignment is off, it can indicate a spondylolisthesis, retrolisthesis, disclocation, fr acture, 
etc. If you see C1 slipped forward (anterior), consider the following possible causes:  
Fracture of dens  
RA, AS, Psoriatic, Reiters  
 
 
Trauma to transverse ligament (tear)  
Agenesis of dens  
Os Odontoidium (secondary growth center)  
Possible Infection 
Down's Syndrome (20% have agenesis of transverse ligament)  
 
If you see C1 slipped backward (posterior) consider the following possible 
causes:  
Fracture of dens  
Agenesis of dens  
Os Odontoidium (secondary growth center)  
 
If you see a lucency  at the spinous process, consider a secondary growth center 
(failure of fusion of the ossification center) or the possibility of a fracture of 
the spinous process known as Clay Shoveler's fracture (aka coal -miner's or 
root- puller's fracture) usually due to  a hyperflexion type injury (whiplash, 
diving injury, etc).  
Assess all areas of the mandible and occiput/skull on the film. If you are able to see the 
sella turica, assess the size. The normal horizontal dimension should be no greater than 
16mm and the depth no greater than 12mm. If enlarged, it may indicate a normal variant 
or possible space -occupying lesion i.e.: tumor, carotid aneurysm, empty sella syndrome 
(defect in the membrane of the roof of the sella caused by erosion from CSF). If you 
suspect an increase in the size of the sella turica, MRI is considered the test of choice to 
evaluate this finding.  
After you have completed looking at all the bony structures, you need to assess the soft 
tissue structures both anterior and posterior to the spine. Anterior structures include the 
following: 
Hyoid bone at the level of C3  
Thyroid cartilage at the level of C4-5 
Lymph nodes and/or vascular calcifications  
Air Shadows Retropharyngeal space anterior to C2, which should be 
no greater than 5mm and the Retrotracheal space anterior to C6, 
which should be no greater than 20mm  
 
Note:  If measurement is larger consider the following possible 
causes:  
Infection -pus 
Trauma- edema  
 
 
Tumor- neoplasm/malignancies  
Hemorrhage-blood 
 
Posterior structures to assess include the follow ing: 
Nuchal bone -calcification of the ligamentum nuchi or nuchal 
ligament 
Lymph node calcification i.e.: occipital, posterior cervical chain etc.  
 
AP LOWER CERVICAL (APLC):  
Give it your first impression -normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the patient 
is born with) versus acquired (something the patient developed over time either short 
term or long term).  
Note:  Starting point on the APLC scan depends on individual preference. The most 
important component is that all areas of the film are assessed —all osseous as well as soft 
tissue structures.  
Assess the transverse processes (TVP's) starting at the lower portion of the film and 
working up, looking for the last set of TVP's facing upward which is usually T1. Then 
continue up the  spine until you see the first set of TVP's pointing straight out or 
downward this is usually C7. Please note, C7 TVP normally does not extend beyond T1 
TVP. Assess this area for the following possibilities: 
Cervical rib -look for a joint space.  Note:  1% of  the population has cervical ribs and only 
10% have associated symptoms, which may produce thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)  
 Elongated TVP -no joint space  
 Secondary growth center at tip of TVP  
 Assess the spinous processes looking for the following:  
A. Spina bifida occulta - radiographically, would reveal a vertical 
luscent line through the spinous process. This is where the two 
lamina fail to fuse together during osseous development. Spina 
bifida occulta is of no clinical significance and occurs more in males 
than females (9:1 ratio).  
B. Spina bifida vera -radiographically, would reveal a wide defect in the 
posterior neural arch at multiple levels at the site of involvement. In 
addition, a soft tissue mass located posteriorly, anteriorly, or 
laterally to the spine ma y be seen. This mass represents the 
meningocele or myleomenigocele, which is a sac filled with 
cerebrospinal fluid that covers the spinal cord. Spina bifida vera can 
be diagnosed at the 18th fetal week by assay of alpha fetoprotein 
from maternal serum or f rom amniotic fluid aspirate. When seen 
radiographically, a myelography, MRI or ultrasonography is needed 
to determine if the soft tissue mass (fluid -filled sac) contains any 
 
 
spinal cord. Spina bifida vera is of clinical significance because the 
patient may  have several skin problems i.e.: hairy or pigmented 
patch, malformed fibrous tissue and blood vessels and fatty tumors 
(lipomas). In a severe case, the fluid -filled sac may be seen at birth. 
In addition, the child may have clubbed feet and paralysis. In a  mild 
case, the child may not show any gait or motor problems until age 5 
or 6. 
C. Double spinous process sign- radiographically, would reveal a 
horizontal line through the spinous process giving the appearance of 
two spinous processes, which is indicative of a Clay Shoveler's 
fracture (aka coal -miner's or root -puller's fracture) seen on an APLC 
view, caused from a hyperflexion injury (whiplash, diving injury, 
etc.). C7 is the most common spinous process involved, but it can 
also occur at C6 and T1. Clay Shovel er's fracture is considered a 
stable fracture and does not cause any neurological problems.  
Assess the vertebral bodies, pedicles, articular pillars (superior/inferior facets (aka 
zygoapophysis) and TVP's as well as any curvature to the spine scoliosis (le vo)-left vs. 
(dextro)- right. When assessing the vertebral bodies look for fractures, DJD, and 
increased/decreased densities as previously mentioned in part four of this course. Assess 
the uncinate processes (aka joints of VonLuschka or uncovertebral joints , which are 
located at the superior posterolateral aspect of the vertebra C3 -C7. These joints are 
pseudojoints that have a synovial membrane with synovial fluid but no joint capsule. 
They serve as tracks that guide the motion of coupled lateral flexion and ipsilateral 
rotation. These joints also serve to strengthen and stabilize the cervical spine. They 
develop at six years of age and are completed by eighteen. Keep in mind, the most 
common cause of IVF encroachment is hypertrophy of the uncinate processes.  
After assessing,  the spine look at any part of the mandible and manubrium that may be 
visible and look at the clavicles and upper ribs. Normal variants to consider when 
assessing the clavicles and first rib:  
Rhomboid fossa -located inferior medial surface of clavicle, no 
clinical significance, represents a developmental variation at the 
insertion of the rhomboid ligament.  
Companion shadow of clavicle -no clinical significance represents 
subcutaneous tissue, which runs parallel with clavicle.  
Prominent conoid  tubercle of the clavicle- located at the inferior 
distal 1/3 of the clavicle. This normal variant should be 
differentiated from ossification of the coracoclavicular ligament. 
This can be done by radiographic appearance, which usually reveals 
a smooth corticated margin and no history of trauma with a 
prominent conoid tubercle.  
Costochondral calcification first rib -radiographically, the joint 
appears irregular and prominent. This is of no clinical significance.  
 
 
After you have completed looking at all the bony  structures,  you need to assess the soft 
tissue structures, which  are as follows:  
Trachea air shadow -usually starts at the lower border of C5 and 
descends to T4- 5, where it bifurcates to the left and right bronchi. 
Look to see if there is any deviation of the air shadow, which may 
be caused by an atelectasis (a collapsed lung), which tends to suck 
or pull the trachea towards the collapsed lung. Also, look for any 
deviation possibly caused from a soft tissue mass, which tends to 
push the trachea away from th e mass.  
Soft tissue calcifications in the neck (i.e.: vessel, lymph nodes and 
thyroid gland)  
Vessel calcification - tends to run parallel to spine, vessels involved are carotid artery 
and/or vertebral artery. Carotid artery calcification tends to run adjacent to the spine 
where vertebral artery runs over the spine where the foramen transversium are located. 
Keep in mind, vertebral artery calcification is very rare and not often seen on plain film 
x-rays.  
Lymph node calcification- tends to be scattered in the soft tissues adjacent to the spine.  
Thyroid cartilage calcification -usually located over the spine at the levels of C5 through 
C7 and tends run in an oblique direction.  
Apices of lungs -look for calcifications i.e.: lymph nodes, azygos 
fissure, azygos vein or possible calcification and/or aneurysm of the 
aortic knob, as well as any tumors i.e.; Pancost (supersulcus) tumor. 
If you suspect a Pancost tumor, look for the following four cardinal 
signs:  
 Mass in apex of lung  
 Destruction of adjacent rib and/or vertebra  
 Pain down the arm  
 Horner's Syndrome  
 
Note:  Horner's Syndrome affects the cervical thoracic sympathetic nerves causing the 
following. 
Meiosis -constriction of pupi l 
Anhydrosis- loss of sweating on involved side of forehead 
Ptosis -closing of eyelid  
Note:  The diagnosis of a Pancost tumor should be differentiated 
with the following:  
Apical pleural thickening- caused as a result of inflammatory 
disease.  
 
 
Companion shadow of clavicle- which is a subcutaneous tissue 
shadow running parallel with the clavicle.  
Shadow of sternocleidomastoid muscle -which tends to runs vertical 
to the spine.

Colles’ Fracture 
 
Description :  A Colles' fracture refers to an extra-articula r, transverse fracture of the distal radial 
shaft.  It most commonly occurs within 1 in. of  the articular surface, cau sing dorsal angulation of 
the distal fragment in the me taphyseal area, giving the appearance of an upside-down dinner 
fork, radial deviation of ha nd, swelling and ecchymosis.  Severe point tenderness over the 
fracture site can be found with palpation.  Deforming forces in a colles’ fracture lead to:  
• Ulnar positive variance:  The radius is comp ressed (radial shortening) and the ulna is 
now too high.  This causes a radial shift of the wrist and hand. Measurements less than 
9mm in radial length in adults sugg est comminuted or impacted fractures. 
• Changes in radial tilt:  Normal tilt is 15-25 de grees.  Changes in angulation of the radial 
head may also suggest impaction. 
• Changes in radial volar tilt:  Loss of vola r tilt causes difficulty with wrist flexion.  
 Many classification systems have been used to desc ribe fractures involving the distal end of the 
radius such as the AO system and the Frykman system.  However, the Frykman classification, 
which is a modification of AO, is more useful fo r the therapist and surge on.  It is based on the 
mechanism of injury and supports specific treatm ent guidelines for each classifiable injury.  
(Refer to Journal of Hand Therapy  article listed in reference section for classification system 
table).  AO Classification of Colles’ Fractures  
Type Description  
A Extra-articular  
B Partial articular  
C 
1 2 3 Complete articular 
Simple articular and metaphyseal fracture Simple articular with complex metaphyseal fracture Complex articular and metaphyseal fracture 
 If severe enough, Colles’ fractures may heal with some residual malalignment such as a shortened radius or a distal radial displacemen t, which disrupt the relationship of the distal 
radioulnar joint articular surfaces .  This malalignments results in permanent loss of full wrist 
mobility.  Other common complications of Colles’ fracture include associated carpal fracture or ligamentous tear, triangular fibrocartilage comple x (TFCC) tear, distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) 
subluxation or dislocation, acute post reducti on swelling/compartment syndrome.  Late 
complications include extensor policus longus r upture, reflex sympathetic dystrophy (at times 
associated with distraction of an external fixator), median nerve compression/carpal tunnel 
syndrome, malunion, and contractures.  Each of these conditions should be addressed early to 
avoid a more disabling result.

Etiology :  Most common mechanism of injury is a fall on an outstretched hand. The wrist usually 
lands in extension and the forear m in pronation.  The lunate acts as a wedge to shear the radius 
off in a dorsal direction.  The dorsal surf ace undergoes compression while the volar surface 
undergoes tension.  The momentum from the fall often caused sprain of the ulnar collateral 
ligament and an avulsion fracture on the ulnar st yloid process. 
 
Non-operative versus Operative Management :  Indications for non-operative management 
include patients with stable, non-displaced or mi nimally displaced fractures as well as patients 
with poor wound healing and/or medical illnesses that preclude them from surgery and those 
with sedentary lifestyles and lo w functional demands.  They can be managed non-surgically by 
closed reduction, combination cast and splint immob ilization of the wrist fo r about 6 to 8 weeks, 
and instituting early range of moti on exercises when pain permits. 
Surgical treatment is indicated for unstable/dis placed, severely comminuted, or intra-articular 
distal radius fractur es. An unstable injury is defined as a fracture that does not reduce adequately 
with closed fracture manipulati on or that loses reduction below acceptable reduction parameters 
despite appropriate immobilizati on techniques.  The goal is to restore articular congruity and 
axial alignment, including radial length, volar tilt, radi al inclination, as well as maintenance of 
reduction, achievement of bony union, and rest oration of hand and wrist function. 
 Surgical Procedure:   High-energy injuries ar e often associated with extensive swelling, and 
operative intervention should be performed afte r swelling has decreased, usually several days 
after injury.  Various surgical methods includ e percutaneous pinning, ex ternal fixation, or open 
reduction and internal fixation (ORI F) with volar or dorsal plating.

X-RAY SCAN AP OPEN MOUTH (APOM) AND THORACIC SCAN 
(LATERAL):  
 
AP OPEN MOUTH (APOM):  
Give it your first impression —normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the patient 
is born with) versus acquired (something the patient develops over time either short or 
long term).  
Note:  Starting point for the APOM scan depends on the individual's preference. The most 
important component is that all areas of the film are assessed including all osseous  and 
soft tissue structures. Keep in mind that the APOM is a limited view, primarily 
comprising C1, C2, and portions of the maxilla and mandible.  
Assess C2 vertebral body looking to see if there is a compression fracture, 
DJD, or any increased/decreased densities as previously mentioned in part four 
of this course. In addition, look at the pedicles, lamina, bifid spinous process, 
articular pillars (superior/inferior facets (aka zygoapophysis), and TVP's.  
Assess the odontoid process for alignment, height, and any lucency at the base 
or tip of the dens. If there is a lucency at the base of the dens, consider the 
following possibilities: 
Fracture- look for a jagged line (usually thin and lucent)  
Os Odontoidium (secondary growth center) -look for a smooth line 
(usually thick and lucent)  
Complete agenesis of dens (aka odontoid aplasia or no dens), which 
is considered a rare finding, or partial agenesis of the dens 
(hypoplastic dens) which is seen radiographically as a stump of 
bone projecting a little above C1- C2 ar ticulation  
 
 
Malposition of C1- may cause a mock defect from the ring of the 
arch of the atlas giving you the appearance that the odontoid process 
may have a fracture or congenital anomaly.  
Note:  A conservative, inexpensive way to determine a malposition 
of C1 (mock defect) is to retake the view. If it is truly a mock 
defect, then it should not be seen on the retake.  
If there is a lucency at the tip of the dens, consider the following:  
Fracture- look for jagged line (usually thin and lucent)  
Os Terminale  (secondary growth center) look for smooth lines 
(usually a symmetrical, "V" shaped lucent cleft)  
Assess C1 -the lateral masses, anterior and posterior arches, articular 
facets and joint space, TVP's, foramen transversarium.  In addition, 
assess th e paraodontoid spaces, atlantoaxial alignment, maxilla, 
mandible and any part of the skull that can be seen i.e.: occiput, 
mastoid air cells etc.  
When assessing the arch of the atlas on the APOM, consider the 
following helpful method to help differentiate which arch you are 
looking at: Imagine the arch as a mouth, or pair of lips. The 
posterior arch gives the appearance of the lower lip where the 
corners go up. The anterior arch gives the appearance of the upper 
lip where the corners go down. Look to see if  there is a radiolucent 
vertical line at the posterior arch of C1, which would indicate failure 
of fusion of the posterior arch of C1 (aka posterior spondyloschisis). 
When assessing the paraodontoid spaces, look to see if they are 
equal bilaterally. When assessing the atlantoaxial alignment, check 
to see that the lateral masses (lateral margins) of the atlas masses are 
in alignment with the lateral corners of the axis articular surface. If 
the lateral margins do not align properly, consider the following 
possible causes:  
  
Jefferson bursting fracture —a break in C1 arch in two or more spots 
usually caused by an axial compression, which transmits force 
through the occipital condyles to the lateral masses of atlas ca using 
the atlas to slide off the C2 facets. Death or neurological deficit is 
not commonly associated with this type of fracture. Approximately 
50% of patients with this type of fracture will have persistent pain 
and stiffness in their neck and occipital dysesthesia.  
Odontoid fracture  
Alar ligament in stability  
Rotatory atlantoaxial subluxation  
Note:  If there is a laterally tilted odontoid process of more than 5 
degrees and the lateral masses of C1 (lateral margins) do not align 
 
 
with the lateral corners of the axis articular surface, then there is a 
70% chance a fracture of the odontoid process is present.  
Note:  Children 4 years old or younger who reveal radiographically 
that the atlantoaxial alignment is not properly aligned would be 
classified as having a normal variant, which is caused by accelerated 
growth of the atlas.  
Assess any soft tissue structures that can be seen. As a general rule, 
the soft tissue structures for the APOM are limited.  
THORACIC SCAN (LATERAL VIEW):  
Give it your first impression —normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the patient 
is born with) versus acquired (something the patient develops over time, either short or 
long term).  
Assess the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies, paying special attention to the anterior 
longitudinal ligament (ALL) as previously discussed in part three of this course.  
Here is what to look for when assessing the anterior aspect of the vertebral 
bodies of the thoracic spine:  
Thin vertical calcification along the ALL, referred to as marginal syndesmophytes. This 
is usually associated with Ankylosing Spondylitis, (aka Marie Strumpell's disease, an 
inflammatory arthritis). Depending upon the stage of the disease, radiographically the 
patient may have fusion of the posterior facets, IVD and costal articulations.  In addition, 
the patient may have an increase in kyphosis and osteoporosis. They may also have a 
decrease in chest expansion. Lab findings HLA -B27 are positive in 90% of patients with 
ankylosing spondylitis, ESR is increased in the active phase of the disease, CBC reveals 
mild anemia, and RA factor is negative.  
Large flowing spurs along the ALL, referred to as hyperostosis.  These findings are 
usually associated with DISH (diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis), (aka Forestiers 
diease or Ankylosing hyperostosis). Clinically, it is typically seen in males over the age 
of 50 and may cause dysphagia and adult onset diabetes mellitus. The symptomatology 
tends to vary because joint motion is usually unaffected. Radiographically, it does not 
affect the posterior facets or IVD (no fusion) and usual ly the disc spaces are maintained 
at three or more levels. The thoracic spine is the most common region of involvement, 
usually between T7 and T11. Because of the pulsations of the aorta on the left side, the 
development of large flowing spurs (hyperostosis) tend to develop on the right side only. 
Lab findings may demonstrate increased glucose levels (32% of patients diagnosed with 
DISH may have adult onset of diabetes mellitus). The patient may also have a positive 
HLA -B8, seen in approximately 40% of pati ents with DISH.  
Lipping and spurring along the ALL (horizontal projections of bone coming off the 
anterior vertebral bodies and/or posterior vertebral bodies) is referred to as 
spondylophytes, exostosis or osteophytes and are usually associated with DJD, ( aka 
osteoarthritis or wear and tear disease). Clinically, it is typically more common in 
females ages 50 and up. These patients tend to complain of pain and stiffness with 
crepitus during movement of the joints. In addition, they may complain or present wi th 
 
 
swelling of the joints. DJD is the most common form of arthritis. Weightbearing joints 
are usually affected. Vacuum sign (aka vacuum phenomenon) is an important early sign 
of DJD. Vacuum sign usually indicates degeneration of the disc and indicates that  
intersegmental motion is occurring. As a general rule with DJD, radiographically the 
joints are affected asymmetrically with nonuniform loss of joint space. Depending upon 
the stage of the arthritis, osteophytic formation, subchondral sclerosis, subchondr al cysts, 
and degenerative subluxations may be present. Lab findings with DJD are usually 
normal. The following findings in the spine are typical of DJD.  
Lipping/ /spurring anterior and/or posterior vertebral body  
Decreased disc space or height  
Subchondral sclerosis at vertebral endplates  
 
CONTINUATION THORACIC SPINE (LATERAL VIEW):  
Assess the vertebral bodies and disc spaces to look for fractures, DJD, increased and/or 
decreased densities, Hahn's venous clefts and Scheuermann's disease. If a com pression 
fracture of the vertebral body is suspected, look to see if the anterior vertebral body (as 
opposed to the posterior vertebral body) is compressed. If the anterior vertebral body is 
compressed, it is more likely from trauma and/or osteoporosis. If  the posterior vertebral 
body is compressed, this is usually not a good sign and may indicate the possibility of 
some kind of osteolytic disease. An increase in density of the vertebral body may indicate 
some kind of blastic disease. A decrease in density of the vertebral body may indicate 
possible lytic disease. If a thin linear lucency located across the center of the thoracic 
vertebrae is visible, one should not confuse this finding with a pathology. This finding 
most likely represents a normal variant known as Hahn's venous clefts, which are venous 
grooves. In the case of an ivory (or opaque) vertebra, one should consider the following 
possible causes:  
Hodgkin's Lymphoma —radiographically, it may cause an ivory vertebra with scalloping 
both anteriorly and laterally on the vertebra. The scalloping is caused by the lymph node 
tissue presseing on the vertebral body. (Hodgkin's disease tends to affect younger patients 
20-40 years old.)  
Pagets —radiographically, it can cause an ivory vertebra to develop with expansion and 
thickening of the cortex of the vertebra. (Paget's disease tends to affect patients over the 
age of 50 and laboratory findings usually reveal an increase in alkaline phosphatase.)  
Osteoblastic disease —radiographically, it can cause an ivory vert ebra with anterior 
concavity of the vertebra and no cortical thickening.  
Note:  Osteoblastic disease is the most common of these to cause an ivory vertebra, and 
tends to affect patients over the age of 50. Laboratory findings usually reveal an increase 
in acid phosphatase.  
Degenerative sclerosis (Degenerative sclerosis tends to affect patients over the age of 50 
and laboratory findings are usually normal.)  
 
 
Osteomyelitis (Osteomyelitis tends to affect younger patients between the ages of 2 -12 
years old. Laboratory findings may reveal an increase in white blood cells and an 
increase in the ESR and CRP. The patient may also have a fever due to the infection.)  
 
As for Scheuermann's disease, it tends to present in adolescents, males tend to 
be affected more often than females, and the cause is unk nown. Patients may 
complain of  spinal pain and have an increase in thoracic kyphosis, causing a 
deformity of the spine. They are usually more prone to developing early 
degenerative disc disease and disc herniations in the thoracic spine. The 
disease tends to affect the middle and lower thoracic spine and a mild scoliosis 
is usually present. Clinically, the patient has tenderness on palpation and 
percussion of the spinous processes. The hamstrings, iliopsoas and pectoral 
muscles are many times hypertonic. Diagnosis is usually made by both clinical 
and radiographic findings. Radiographically, there is anterior vertebral 
wedging, multiple Schmorl's nodes (irregular vertebral endplates) and 
narrowing of the intervertebral discs.  It is important to note that 50% of 
patients with Scheuermann's disease can have spondylolysis and 50% will 
have degenerative changes at the thoracic spine.  
Assess the posterior elements —pedicles, superior and inferior facets (aka zygapophysis), 
TVP's, la mina and spinous process.  
Assess the thoracic curve for hyper - or hypokyphotic curve, flat back (aka straight back) 
utilizing Thoracic Kyphosis Measurement and Thoracic Cage Dimension.  
 
Thoracic Kyphosis Measurement —draw a parallel line through the superi or endplate of 
the first thoracic vertebral body and another parallel line through the inferior endplate of 
the twelfth thoracic vertebral body. Then, draw perpendicular lines from these lines and 
measure where the lines intersect. The angle varies dependi ng on the sex and age of the 
patient. Males tend to be between 40 and 66 degrees, and females between 36 and 56 
degrees. It should be noted that an increase kyphosis can be seen with older patients, 
osteoporotic patients, Scheuermann's disease, congenital anomalies, muscular paralysis 
and cystic fibrosis. A decrease kyphosis (straight back syndrome) may change the 
dynamics of the intracardiac blood flow and mimic a possible cardiac murmur.  
 
Thoracic Cage Dimension —measure the distance between the posterior sternum and 
anterior surface of the eighth thoracic vertebral body. Normal measurements in a male 
should be 14cm with a maximum of 18cm and a minimum of 11cm. Females should be 
12cm with a maximum of 15cm and a minimum of 9cm. If a patient has a flat back (aka 
straight back), the normal measurement in males is 11cm and females 10cm.  
Assess the axillary border of the scapula, which is usually overlying the upper portion of 
the thoracic spine.   Also, assess any ribs that may be visualized and the anterior bony 
chest wall sternum looking for any deformities i.e.; Pectus Excavatum (aka funnel chest, 
a depression at the sternum) and Pectus Carinatum (aka pigeon chest, an anterior 
displacement of the sternum). In many cases, these anterior bony chest wall disorder s can 
be observed during physical examination of the patient.  
 
 
Assess any soft tissue structures that may be visualized i.e.; diaphragm, heart, lungs, 
tracheal air shadow, and retrosternal space. Keep in mind that the right diaphragm tends 
to be seen stretching across the whole lower thorax and passes through the lower portion 
of the heart shadow, whereas the left diaphragm disappears as it reaches the posterior 
border of the heart. Typically, the right hemidiaphragm is higher than the left. Assess the 
heart  shadow for size and density. The lungs should be assessed looking at the peripheral 
and hilar portion for any increased or decreased densities i.e.; opacities (white areas) or 
lucency (black areas). Assess the posterior costophrenic sulcus for any obliter ation, and 
look to see if there are any lung fissures present. In addition, look at the trachea air 
shadow for any kind of deviation or shifting and assess the retrosternal space for any 
masses.  
 
X-RAY SCAN THORACIC SPINE (AP VIEW):  
 
THORACIC SPINE (AP VIE W): 
Give it your first impression —normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the patient 
is born with) versus acquired (something the patient develops over time, either short or 
long term).  
Assess all bony structures i.e.; vertebrae, pedicles, lamina, s pinous process, superior and 
inferior facets (aka zygapophysis), TVP's, ribs (costotransverse and costovertebral joints), 
manubrium, clavicle and scapula. When assessing the vertebral body, look for any 
compression fractures and try to differentiate between pathological vs. nonpathological as 
previously discussed in part seven of this course under lateral thoracic spine. Look for 
any hemivertebra more commonly seen at the lower thoracic spine and look for any 
increased or decreased density changes in the vertebral body as previously discussed in 
part seven of this course under lateral thoracic spine. Assess the pedicles for missing 
pedicle sign, hypertrophy of the opposite pedicle, or a radiopaque pedicle. If there is an 
absence of the pedicle without hypertrophy of the opposite pedicle, consider the 
possibility of metastatic carcinoma. If there is an absence of the pedicle and the opposite 
pedicle shows hypertrophy along with the presence of reactive sclerosis, consider a long-
standing congenital lesion, the  result of a stress response. If you see both pedicles and 
one appears sclerotic, consider the cause to be possibly from an osteoid osteoma.  
 
Osteoid osteoma is a benign painful tumor, which primarily affects younger patients 
between the ages of 10 -25. Sym ptoms are usually described as a deep, achy pain with a 
gradual onset, which increases in severity over time. Rest and/or exercise do not relieve 
pain, and pain seems to increase at night. Patients' with night pain may experience 
significant relief with as pirin. The location  of osteoid osteoma is usually in the femur and 
tibia (50% of the time) and in the spine (10% of the time). When the spine is involved, it 
can occur in the thoracic, lumbar, cervical or sacrum. 60% of spinal lesions occur in the 
lumbar s pine in the neural arch (i.e.; lamina, pedicles, facet and spinous process). 
Radiographically, a common finding is a radiopaque pedicle. This needs to be 
differentiated from a hypertrophied pedicle, caused from agenesis of the opposing 
pedicle.  
 
 
 
Note:  Treatment of choice for osteoid osteoma is usually surgical excision with 
immediate relief of symptoms. Recurrence is rare. Continue looking at the thoracic bony 
structures assessing the lamina, making sure there is appropriate fusion of the lamina to 
form the  spinous process. Assess spinous process for any spina bifida occulta, fractures, 
or deformities. Look at both the superior and inferior facets and TVP's for any nonunion 
(secondary growth centers), agenesis, fractures and/or hypertrophy. Assess the ribs f or 
any fractured ribs, hypoplastic ribs, bifurcated ribs, or fused ribs (congenital synostosis). 
Look for any costochondral cartilage calcification, which is a normal variant seen in 
children and adults and is of no clinical significance. Assess the manubr ium, clavicles 
and scapula for any fractures and/or secondary growth centers. When assessing the 
clavicles also look for any normal variants like a rhomboid fossa, companion shadow, or 
prominent conoid tubercle as previously discussed in part five of this course under APLC  
Assess for any scoliosis (lateral deviation of the spinal column from the midsagittal 
plane).  
Two Main Categories of Scoliosis:  Structural vs. Nonstructural  
Structural Scoliosis  - a lateral curvature that is fixed and does not correct 
upon motion.  
 
Classifications of Structural Scoliosis:  
Idiopathic scoliosis -considered the most common and represents up to 80% of the 
scolioses. The most common curve pattern is a right convex thoracic curve. Cause 
unknown. Three types of idiopathic scoliosis: 
A. Infantile - less than 3 years  
B. Juvenile 3- 10 years  
C. Adolescent - greater than 10 years  
 
Note:  Adolescent is the most common type of idiopathic scoliosis. 
A common finding in a scoliosis in the adolescent idiopathic type is 
a lateral wedged defo rmity of the vertebral body, which remains in 
adult life. This deformity is caused by a lack of development located 
at the discovertebral junction on the concave side of the curvature 
because of either excessive or inadequate compressive. (This is 
known as  Hueter -Volkmann principle.)  
Note:  Idiopathic scoliosis of 15 degrees or more that occurs before 
the age of eleven should be considered suspicious of a significant 
intraspinal pathology. A severe or rapidly progressing left -sided 
thoracic/thoracolumbar sco liosis (the opposite of the classic 
idiopathic scoliosis) should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out the 
possibility of some kind of intraspinal pathology i.e.: spinal tumor, 
syringomyelia, or Arnold- Chiari malformation.  
Congenital Scoliosis - recognized by anomalies of the vertebrae or ribs. The most 
common anomalies seen with congenital scoliosis are hemivertebrae, block vertebrae, 
 
 
fusion of ribs, or spina bifida. Congenital scoliosis is often associated with anomalies of 
the genitourinary system.  
Neuromus cular Scoliosis -caused by some kind of nerve or muscle disease i.e.; Cerebral 
palsy, syringomyelia, poliomyelitis, or muscular dystrophy.  
Neurofibromatosis - inherited congenital disorder of neuro and mesoectodermal tissue 
(nerves and skin). Scoliosis deformity is a short angular kyphosis with dysplasia of the 
vertebral body.  
Miscellaneous causes of structural scoliosis  
Trauma to the spine from fractures/dislocations  
Infections from tuberculosis which can lead to 
deformities i.e.; Gibbus deformity (angular k yphosis) 
Advanced DJD  
Radiation therapy on a growing spine for Wilm's tumor 
and neuroblastoma  
Tumors of bone, connective tissue disorders and possibly 
spinal surgery 
 
Nonstructural (aka) Functional Scoliosis - a curvature that has no structural 
deformity and corrects upon motion. Some common causes are leg length 
inequality, postural, hysteria, antalgia from a disc herniation, possible tumor 
and/or inflammatory bowel disease etc.  
 
Common Complications of Scoliosis:  
Cardiopulmonary disease  
DJD 
Deformity  
Pain 
Classifications of Scoliosis Based on Location:  
Cervical  
Cervicothoracic 
Mid Thoracic  
Thoracolumbar 
Lumbar 
Lumbosacral  
Double Lumbar and Thoracic  
 
 
Radiographic Assessment of Scoliosis Utilizing Plain Film X -rays:  
 
Four Methods -Curvature Measurem ent, Rotation, Flexibility and 
Maturation  
Curvature Measurement -consists of two methods (Cobb and Risser -
Ferguson Method)  
Cobb Method- most accepted method for measuring scoliotic 
deviation . A line is drawn along the superior end plate of the 
cephalad vertebrae at the most extreme point of the scoliosis.   Then, 
a line is drawn along the inferior end plate of the caudad vertebrae 
at the most extreme point of the scoliosis. Perpendicular lines are 
then drawn at right angles from both the superior and inferior end 
plate lines and the angle is measured where they intersect . For 
curves less than 20 degrees, no bracing or surgical intervention is 
required. Patients between the ages of 10 and 15 with a curvature of 
less than 20 degrees should be monitored every three months. 
Curves between 20- 40 degrees should be braced (Milwaukee brace) 
and monitored every three months until maturity. Curves more than 
40 degrees are considered surgical candidates utilizing Harrington 
rods or Dwyer procedure (screws and wires).  
Note:  Treatment of scoliosis is based upon curve progression and its 
effects on cosmetic appearance and body function. Conservative 
treatment would consist of exercises, spinal manipulation and 
physiotherapy. Goals of treatment are to relieve pain, prevent 
progression, increase ROM, restore strength and stability to joints 
and rehabilitate muscles.  
Note: With spinal manipulation, always approach from the 
convexity of the curve.  
Risser -Ferguson Method -locate both the cephalad and caudad 
vertebrae at the most extr eme point of the scoliosis as described in 
the Cobb method. Then, locate the most lateral vertebra between 
these vertebrae which is considered the apical vertebra. For each of 
these vertebrae, draw diagonal lines from opposite corners of the 
vertebral bodi es and locate the area where the lines cross on each of 
these vertebra. The lines should intersect at the center of each of 
these vertebral bodies. Then draw lines from the center of the 
cephalad vertebra and caudad vertebra to the center of the apical 
vertebra and measure the angle where they intersect at the apical 
vertebra. This method gives measurements approximately 25% 
below that of the Cobb method and therefore is not as accurate.  
 
Rotation Analysis —(Consists of two methods: Spinous Method and 
Pedicl e Method)  
Spinous method- assessing rotation based upon spinous process 
deviation. This is not reliable because of spinous malformation.  
 
 
Pedicle method - most accepted method to determine rotation . 
This method assesses rotation of the vertebra using the pedicles as 
the reference point. Look at the movement of the pedicle on the 
convex side of the curve. It is graded between 0 and 4 and is 
considered a measurement of anterior deformity. 0 is no rotation 
(normal) where 4 is complete rotation of the pedicle from one side 
to the opposite side.  
 
Flexibility Evaluation by Lateral Bending —a method to assess the degree of 
mobility within a scoliosis. This method also assesses the correctability and 
evaluates the prognosis of a scoliosis. The spine (radiograph) is evaluated in 
the neutral position first, then evaluated in both left and right lateral flexion to 
determine if the curve disappears. If the curve disappears, it would indicate a 
nonstructural scoliosis. If the curve does not disappear, it would indicate a 
structural scoliosis.  
Note:  If there is failure of the scoliosis (curvature) to correct on lateral 
bending, then the scoliosis (curvature) is considered irreversible and 
nonprogressive. 
 
Skeletal Maturation —is important when trying to determining skeletal 
maturity and is essential in determining treatment and prognosis. One common 
indicator of spinal maturity is evaluating the iliac epiphysis (Risser's Sign) to 
see if complete fusion has occurred. The epiphysis is divided into 4 equal 
quarters starting at the lateral portion of the iliac crest and progressing 
posteriorly and medially towards the posterior superior iliac spine. When 
complete fusion finally occurs, it is considered a fifth quarter. Curve 
progression usually stops in females with a Risser Sign of 4 and in males with 
a Risser Sign of 5.  
 
Determining when MRI should be ordered on a Scoliosis Patient:  
A. Patients with a scoliosis younger than 11 years old  
B. A thoracic and/or thoracolumbar scoliosis progressing quickly  
C. Absent family history of scoliosis  
D. A scoliosis in a young patient that has no real movement (stiff/rigid)  
E. A patient with scoliosis that has pain and does not seem to respond 
to conservative treatment  
F. Abnormal radiographic findings i.e.; hemivertebrae, basilar 
impression, pedicle widening, or enlarged spinal canal diameter.  
G. Positive neurological findings i.e.; muscle weakness, muscle 
atrophy, sensory loss, cranial nerve problem, abnormal DTR's, or 
dysfunction with bladder or bowel.  
 
 
 
 
Things to Consider When Performing a Chiropractic Spinal Analysis 
Examination: 
 
The patient's posture should always be examined by visually observing the 
anterior, posterior and lateral aspects of the patient.  
Anterior- look for muscle imbalance (hypertrophy vs. atrophy), 
chest deformities (barrel chest, pectus excavatum or funnel chest, 
and pectus carinatum or pigeon chest).  
Posterior- look for muscle imbalance (hypertrophy vs. atrophy), 
head tilt, shoulder height, scapula height/winging, rib cage 
deformity, pelvic unleveling and spinal curvature (scoliosi s). 
Lateral -look for anterior head carriage (translation aka protraction 
and/or retraction), normal cervical, thoracic, lumbar and 
lumbosacral curves (increase/decrease lordotic/kyphotic curves), 
sway back, flat back, Dowager's hump, Gibbus deformity and barrel 
chest.  
The patient should also be examined for upper cross syndrome and lower cross 
syndrome. 
Upper Cross Syndrome -elevation and protraction of the shoulders, 
rotation and abduction (winging) of the scapula and forward head 
posture. Usually a result of weak deep neck flexors, rhomboids and 
serratus anterior muscles and tight pectorals, upper trapezius and 
levator scapula muscles.  
Lower Cross Syndrome- anteriorly rotated pelvis, increase lumbar 
lordosis and slight flexion of the hips. Usually a result of weak 
gluteus maximus and abdominal muscles and tight erector spinae 
and iliopsoas muscles.  
Assess any soft tissue structures that may be visualized i.e.; diaphragm, heart, lungs, 
tracheal air shadow, costal cartilage, gastric air bubble known as magenblasum and 
aorta.   Look for the following:  
Look for displacement, enlargement, density changes, and 
calcifications.  
When looking at the diaphragm, the right should be higher than the 
left because of the heart. The difference between the heights of the 
diaphra gm should be no more than 3cm.  
Assess the heart shadow for size and density- the heart shadow 
should be no greater than 1/2 of the transthoracic diameter.  
Look at the lung fields for any increased or decreased densities i.e.;  
opacities (white areas) or lucency (black areas). Look for any lung 
fissures that may be visualized i.e.; horizontal, oblique and/or 
 
 
azygos fissures. Displacement of a fissure may be a sign of a 
collapsed lung.  
Determine that the left hilar region is high er than the right because 
of the heart. Assess the size, shape and density of the hila.  
Look at the tracheal air shadow, which is located slightly more on 
the right side because of the aortic arch. Look for the trachea 
bifurcation at the level of T4 -5 and assess for any deviation, which 
may be caused from a lesion in the lung, a problem with the 
mediastinum, an infection, trauma, hemorrhage etc.  
Look at the gastric air bubble, which is normally located on the left 
side in the stomach below the diaphragm. If  the gastric air bubble is 
seen above diaphragm, think possible hiatal hernia.  
Look at the aorta for any atherosclerotic calcification, tortuosity 
and/or aneurysm formation. Thoracic aortic aneurysms can occur in 
several locations along the aorta i.e.; ascending thoracic aorta, aortic 
arch and descending thoracic aorta. Of these thoracic aortic 
aneurysms, the least common area is the ascending thoracic aorta. 
The most common thoracic aortic aneurysm is the aortic arch. The 
aorta is the most common vessel to  develop an aneurysm and the 
number one cause is atherosclerosis. Men are more affected than 
females in a 4 to 1 ratio. More than 95% of atherosclerotic 
aneurysms happen between the ages of 60 and 80. Calcification of 
the aorta increases with age and in patients age 45 and older 40% 
tend to have a positive finding for calcification on plain film x- rays. 
The most common location for an aortic aneurysm as well as most 
frequently seen calcified vessel is in the abdomen specifically the 
abdominal aorta which will be discussed in detail in section nine 
and ten under lumbar spine scan. In addition, assessment of the 
costophrenic and cardiac angles should be done looking for any 
obliteration.  
 
Note: When evaluating the AP thoracic spine, if lung pathology is possibly 
suspected a chest film should be performed and/or ordered to further evaluate any 
suspicious findings  
 
X-RAY SCAN LUMBAR SPINE (LATERAL VIEW):  
1. Give it your first impression—normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the 
patient is born with) versus acquired (something the patient develops over time, either 
short or long term).  
2. Assess the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies paying special attention to the 
anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) as previously discussed in part three of this cours e. 
 
 
What to look for when assessing the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies of the lumbar 
spine. 
• Thin, vertical calcification along the ALL referred to as marginal 
syndesmophytes. This is usually associated with Ankylosing 
Spondylitis, (aka Marie Strumpell's disease, an inflammatory arthritis). 
In the early or  initial stage of the disease,  radiographically there may be 
local destruction of the rim of the vertebral body, which gives the 
appearance of a radiolucent erosion of the corner of the vertebra, 
known as Romanus lesion. This finding tends to decrease the concavity 
of the anterior vertebral body, giving it a squared appearance. 
Sometimes the reparative process can be rapid and cause the anterior 
vertebral body to become convex which is known as barre l-shaped 
vertebra. When this erosion of the corner of the vertebra heals, it 
becomes sclerotic and is known as shiny corner sign. These early 
radiographic findings are not easily seen. Late in the disease 
progression, the patient tends to have fusion of the posterior facets and 
IVD. Complications might then occur, like a fracture through the 
ankylosed vertebral column, (known as a carrot stick fracture) which 
tends to occur at the thoracolumbar and lower cervical spine. Another 
complication might be an Andersson lesion, which is the failure of the 
carrot stick fracture to reunite (reankylose). In addition, the patient may 
have a decreased lumbar lordosis. Complete fusion bilaterally of the 
sacroiliac joints occurs in 50% of the patients. The disease tends to 
initially start at the sacroiliac joints and ascend up the spine and skip to 
the thoracolumbar spine, costal articulations and cervical spine as 
previously mentioned in part three of this course under "cervical spine 
neutral lateral view." Also, in the lu mbar spine on the (AP lumbar 
view) if ossification occurs at the joint capsule, ligamentum flavum and 
interspinous ligaments (an appearance of three parallel opaque lines) 
will appear over the lumbar spine which is called trolley track sign. In 
addition, in the lumbar spine on the (AP lumbar view) if the 
interspinous and supraspinous ligaments ossify an appearance of one 
vertical opaque line will run over the lumbar spinous process called 
dagger sign. When women are affected with this disease, the 
radiographic findings are less severe, the sacroiliac joints are still 
involved, but there is little to no involvement of the spine.   Women 
tend to have involvement of the peripheral joints. Lab finding HLA -
B27 is positive in 90% of patients with ankylosing spondyl itis, ESR is 
increased in the active phase of the disease, CBC reveals mild anemia 
and RA factor is negative.  
• Large, flowing spurs along the ALL referred to as hyperostosis. These 
findings are usually associated with DISH (diffuse idiopathic skeletal 
hyper ostosis), aka Forestiers disease or Ankylosing hyperostosis. As 
previously discussed in part three of this course under "cervical spine 
neutral lateral view" radiographically, it does not affect the posterior 
 
 
facets or IVD (no fusion) and usually the disc spaces are maintained at 
three or more levels. More commonly, it seems to affect the upper three 
lumbar vertebrae. Sacroiliac joint involvement tends to be seen after 
the spine is already involved and ossification seems to involve the most 
superior and inferior aspect of the joint. Lab findings may demonstrate 
increased glucose levels (32% of patients diagnosed with DISH may 
have adult onset of diabetes mellitus). The patient may also have a 
positive HLA - B8, seen in approximately 40% of patients with DISH.  
• Lipping and spurring along the ALL (horizontal projections of bone 
coming off the anterior vertebral bodies and/or posterior vertebral 
bodies) and is referred to as spondylophytes, exostosis or 
osteophytes.  These  are usually associated with DJD, aka osteoarthritis, 
or wear and tear disease. Clinically it is typically more common in 
females, ages 50 and up. These patients tend to complain of pain and 
stiffness, with crepitus during movements of the joints. In addition, 
they may complain or present with swe lling of the joints. DJD is the 
most common form of arthritis. Weightbearing joints are usually 
affected. Vacuum sign (aka vacuum phenomenon) is an important early 
sign of DJD. Vacuum sign usually indicates degeneration of the disc 
and indicates that inter segmental motion is occurring. As a general rule 
with DJD, radiographically the joints are affected asymmetrically with 
nonuniform loss of joint space. Depending upon the stage of the 
arthritis, osteophytic formation, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral 
cysts, and degenerative subluxations can be present.. Lab findings with 
DJD are usually normal. The following findings of the spine are typical 
of DJD.  
Decreased disc space or height  
Subchondral sclerosis at vertebral endplates  
Lipping/spurring anterior and/or posterior vertebral body  
3. Assess the anterior vertebral bodies for chip fractures and limbus bone. Chip fracture 
can be caused by trauma and/or pulling of the ALL. Limbus bone is caused from 
migration and herniation of the nuclear material of the disc through a secondary growth 
center at the corner of the anterior vertebral body resulting in nonunion of the secondary 
growth center.  
4. Assess the vertebral bodies and disc spaces by looking for compression fractures, DJD, 
hemangiomas and any increased and/or decreased densities. If a compression fracture is 
suspected of the vertebral body, look to see if the anterior vertebral body is compressed 
vs. the posterior vertebral body. Try and differentiate between pathological vs. non- 
pathological. Once again, if the anterior vertebral body is compressed it is more likely 
from trauma and/or osteoporosis. If the posterior vertebral body is compressed, this is 
usually not a good sign and may indicate the possibility of some kind of osteolytic 
disease. When assessing for a hemangioma, look for coarse striations in the vertebral 
body separated by lucent areas between the coarse areas (referred to as corduroy cloth 
 
 
appearance). Most hemangiomas are located in the spine or skull and are considered the 
most common benign bone tumor of the spine. When located in the spine, hemangiomas 
are most commonly in the upper lumbar spine and lower thoracic spine. Hemangiomas 
are painless, benign bone tumors that do not become malignant.   Most are found in adults 
over 40 years of age and usually do not require any treatment. Continue looking at the 
lumbar bony structures, assessing for any density changes in the vertebrae. A decrease in 
density of the vertebral body may indicate possible lytic disease. An increase in density 
of the vertebral body may indicate some kind of blastic disease. In the case of an ivory 
(or opaque) vertebra,  consider the following possible causes: Hodgkin's Lymphoma, 
Paget's, Osteoblastic disease, possible degenerative sclerosis  and osteomyelitis (as 
previously discussed in parts four and seven of this course.  
Note:  Osteoblastic disease is the most common of these to cause an ivory vertebra.  
5. Assess the lumbar curve for hyper - or hypolordotic curve or sway back utilizing the 
Lumbar Lordosis Measurement, Lumbosacral Angle and Lumbar Gravity Line.  
Lumbar Lordosis Measurement  is done by drawing a line parallel to the superior 
endplate of L1 and the superior endplate of S1 or the inferior endplate of L5. Then, draw 
perpendicular lines from the parallel lines and measure the angle at their intersection. The 
normal measurement is between 50 and 60 degrees. An increase in the angle would 
indicate a hyperlordosis, whereas a decrease in the angle would indicate a hypolordosis.  
Lumbosacral Angle  is assessed by drawing a horizontal line parallel to the bottom edge 
of the film and placing it over the sacrum. Draw an oblique line through the parallel line 
across the sacral base. Measure the angle where the lines intersect at the posterior. The 
normal average lumbosacral angle in the upright position is 41 degrees, but can vary 
considerably with a minimum of 26 degrees and a maximum of 57 degrees. Significance 
of these findings can vary. An increased lumbosacral angle may be a mechanical factor in 
causing low back pain.  
Lumbar Gravity Line  is assessed by drawing diagonal lines from the corners of L3 
vertebral body.   Where they intersect at the center of L3, draw a vertical line from that 
point down to the sacrum. Assess this vertical line at the sacrum to see where on the 
sacrum it passes through. If the line passes anterior to the sacrum by more than 10mm, an 
increase lumbosacral angle may be occurring  
6. Assess the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies looking to see if there is any shifting 
of the vertebra above from the vertebra below i.e.; anteriolisthesis, retrolisthesis and 
spondylolisthesis. If you suspect a shifting of the vertebral body forward like in a 
spondylolisthesis, consider utilizing Meyerding's Grading Method. For purposes of this 
course, L5 -S1 level will be discussed, but one should recognize that this method can be 
applied to any other spinal level. To start, divide the base of the sacrum (sacral 
promontory) into four equal sections or grades, each one representing a 1/4. Ass ess the 
posterior inferior aspect of L5 vertebra to see if the vertebral body has shifted forward. 
Grade 1 indicates a 1/4 shift forward, Grade 2 indicates a 1/2 shift forward, Grade 3 
indicates 3/4 shift forward; Grade 4 indicates the vertebra has shifted  to the end of the 
sacral promontory. If there is complete shifting forward where the vertebra is completely 
 
 
off the sacral promontory, it is sometimes referred to as a Grade 5 spondylolisthesis or a 
spondyloptosis. 
Note:  When assessing L5 for spondylolist hesis, always look at the anterior aspect of the 
sacrum to see if there is any buttressing, which is calcification projecting out from the 
anterior aspect of the sacrum. This usually indicates a long -standing process and is one 
way that the body tries to protect/stabilize itself by building a bridge of calcium.  
Spondylolysis and/or Spondylolisthesis Clinical and Radiographic Significance:  
Definitions:  
Spondylolisthesis -indicates a break or separation at the vertebral arch (pars 
interarticularis) with forwar d displacement (slippage) of the vertebral body.  
Note:  Another term for describing this type of radiographic finding is known as 
spondylolytic spondylolisthesis.  
Spondylolysis -indicates a break or separation at the vertebral arch (pars interarticularis) 
without forward displacement (slippage) of the vertebral body.  
Note:  Another term for describing this type of radiographic finding is known as 
nonspondylolytic spondylolisthesis.  
Important facts to consider:  
• Approximately 90% of spondylolytic spondylolisthes es are at L5.  
• Approximately 10% are located at the lumbar spine (L1- L4) and the 
cervical spine.  
Note:  The cervical spine is a rare area in which to develop a 
spondylolisthesis, but when present C6 tends to be the most common 
level effected in the cervical spine. Most are asymptomatic, and the 
defect in the vertebral arch is almost always bilateral and found in 
males. Approximately 50% of patients with cervical spondylolysis have 
an associated spina bifida occulta of the involved vertebra. The most 
common cause of cervical spondyolisthesis is congenital agenesis or 
dysplasia of the pedicle.  
• Approximately 5- 7% are found in whites.  
• Athletes or very active people tend to have a higher incidence of 
spondylolysis 
Note:  Participation in sports is acceptable provided there is no 
biomechanical instability or neurological deficits.  
• Studies have shown that Alaskan Eskimos have a 40% higher 
prevalence of pars defects.  The reason for this may be that Eskimo 
infants are often carried in an upright posture  at an early age, thereby 
stressing the pars interarticularis.  
• Approximately 50% of patients with spondylolysis and/or 
spondylolisthesis are asymptomatic and do not develop back pain.  
 
 
• Patients can develop just a unilateral spondyloylsis, which causes a 
compensatory stress hypertrophy of the contralateral pars and pedicle, 
which may then mimic a neoplastic disorder like an osteoid osteoma, 
osteoblastoma or localized osteoblastic metastasis. One way to help 
make a differential diagnosis is to look for a unila teral pars defect on 
the side opposite the sclerotic pedicle.  
• Many times a patient with a spondylolisthesis of a grade three or more 
will reveal Napoleon's hat sign, which has the appearance of taking 
Napoleon's top hat and flipping it upside down. In addi tion, this usually 
has an appearance of an opacity (white curved line running from the 
top of the hat to the rim). If this appears, it is referred to as  bowline of 
Brailsford . This would only be seen on an AP view of the lumbar spine 
and is seen superimposed over the base/upper portion of the sacrum.  
• Patients you suspect to have a spondyloylsis (defect in the pars 
interarticularis) should be further evaluated with oblique films to assess 
the so called  Scotty Dog. If a pars defect is present on an oblique film, 
it would reveal a radiolucency at the neck of the Scotty Dog, 
representing a separation of the pars interarticularis which is considered 
a broken neck or collar  
Further evaluation can certainly be done by utilizing advance diagnostic imaging.   For 
example:   SPECT test (single -photon emission computed tomography) and/or MRI 
(magnetic resonance imaging).   These tests are critical when evaluating the physiological 
changes associated with spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis.   Of these two tests  the 
MRI tends to be the better choice because there is no radiation exposure to the patient and 
it provides better visualization of anatomical structure beyond just the pars 
interarticularis.   As long as the MRI is done with STIR (short -t-inversion recove ry) 
sequences it allows one to detect fat suppression thereby, detecting edema and assisting 
with determining if the condition is active versus an inactive state.  
Determining if the spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis is active or inactive would 
certain ly assist clinically in the management of the patient. Active indicates that there is 
activity associated with the pars defect and that the defect most likely will produce the 
patient to have symptoms. Inactive indicates that the patient may have symptoms,  but the 
cause of the symptoms is most likely not due to the pars defect but from another source. 
Patients with inactive spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis tend to have exacerbations 
of low back pain throughout their lives. In general, these patients s eem to do well with 
conservative treatment for managing their flare- ups and should be encouraged to continue 
with their conservative care provided they do not develop any neurological deficits.  
• Patients who do develop back pain tend to have another cause f or their 
symptoms i.e.; biomechanical or pathologic cause.  
• Progression of the spondylolisthesis (displacement) rarely occurs after 
the age of 18.  
• Physical examination findings may reveal a hyperlordosis of the 
lumbar spine, a palpable step defect, appearance of a heart -shaped 
 
 
buttock, and a clicking sensation at the involved level during forward 
flexion of the trunk or straight leg raising. The patient may also have 
unexplained hamstring tightness.  
Six Classifications of Spondylolisthesis:  
• Congenital—born w ith a defect in the vertebral arch (pars interarticularis)  
• Isthmic defect —caused by stress, elongation of pars or acute fracture. Isthmic 
defect specifically from a stress fracture is considered the number one cause of 
pars defects.  
• Degenerative—wearing down of the facets from DJD causing an anterior 
translation. Degenerative spondylolisthesis is most common at L4, more 
common in females over the age of 40 and is seen three times more in blacks 
than whites. In addition, degenerative spondylolisthesis is four times more 
likely to be seen with a sacralization of L5 vertebra.  
• Traumatic —caused from direct trauma 
• Pathologic—caused from pathology some kind of disease of the bone  
• Iatrogenic—caused secondary to spinal surgery 
Management and Prognosis:  
• Conservative treatment is recommended over surgery unless the patient has an 
unstable spondylolisthesis or neurocompressive radiculopathy. In the absence 
of an unstable spondylolisthesis and/or neurocompressive radiculopathy, the 
doctor and patient should exhaust all conservative measures first prior to 
considering any surgical correction. Treatment management should also be 
based upon determining if the spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis is in the 
active vs. inactive phase.  
Special Note:  If the patient  has an active spondylolysis and/or 
spondylolisthesis, it is recommended that the patient wear a brace known as 
a Boston overlap (antilordotic brace). This brace is usually worn periodically 
for a couple of weeks and then for approximately four months for 23 hours a 
day so the pars defect can attempt to heal. The patient can slowly start 
exercising while wearing the brace beginning with light stretching of the 
hamstrings and slowly adding abdominal and lumbar flexion exercises as 
improvement is seen and he or she is no longer in the acute stages. During 
abdominal and lumbar flexion exercises, the patient does not have to wear the 
brace. It should be noted that this protocol is usually very successful for 
healing of the pars defect.  
Note:  If the patient is in  an inactive and/or chronic phase, conservative 
treatment is usually beneficial and may include possible lifestyle changes 
(restriction and/or limited activity depending upon the cause of the patient's 
pain). Strengthening exercises for the abdominal and l ower back muscles, 
nonnarcotic analgesics and chiropractic spinal manipulation (i.e.; side posture, 
Cox flexion/distraction and lumbosacral stretch).   Choice of manipulation 
should be determined by doctor preference and patient tolerance.  
 
 
Note:  The reason for spinal manipulation is because many times patients who 
present with a spondylolisthesis seem to have other conditions that are really 
the cause of their back pain i.e.; hyperlordosis, facet syndrome and/or 
sacroiliac fixation.  
7.  Assess the posterior elements of the lumbar spine -look for all normal anatomy 
pedicles, superior and inferior facets (aka zygapophysis), TVP's, lamina and spinous 
processes and evaluate for any abnormalities. After assessing the lumbar spine, look at 
the ilium/iliac crests, sa crum, and coccyx (if visualized) and evaluate for any 
abnormalities.  
8. Assess any soft tissue structures that are visible. Specifically look anterior to the 
lumbar vertebra for any calcification of the abdominal aorta. If calcification is visualized, 
one must assess for any dilatation of the vessel. If the abdominal aorta measures 3.8cm at 
its most distant calcified borders consider a high probability of an abdominal aortic 
aneurysm triple A (AAA). Because of the close relationship of the aorta and the ant erior 
portion of the vertebrae, evaluation of the anterior vertebral bodies should be assessed for 
any vertebral body erosions known as Oppenheimer erosions, which can occur within a 
two-year period and are present in approximately 5% of AAA. Abdominal aor tic 
aneurysms are more common in males at a 5 to 1 ratio. Most patients (40%) with AAA 
have hypertension, and 30% have heart disease. Most AAA start 1- 2cm below the renal 
arteries infrarenal and 90 -95% of the aneurysms are atherosclerotic. Many times the 
patient is asymptomatic, but if symptoms do occur, they are usually intermittent 
abdominal and low back pain. Often times, aneurysms are detected on plain film x- rays if 
calcification of the vessel is present. Calcification is usually present in 55 -85% of 
aneurysms. Aneurysms can rupture —7cm or larger there is a 75% chance of rupture, 6cm 
15% chance of rupture and 5cm there is less than a 5% chance of rupture. Patients with 
aneurysms 5cm or larger usually undergo elective surgery. Below 5cm the patient is 
monitored every four to six months by physical examination (palpation and auscultation) 
as well as diagnostic ultrasound. Palpation of the abdomen should be done in order 
toassess the abdominal aorta for a bounding pulse or any enlargement of the vessel. If the 
dilation of the vessel exceeds the midclavicular line, this usually indicates an enlarged 
vessel (dilation).  
In addition, the doctor can assess the peripheral pulses of the lower extremities (iliac, 
femoral, popliteal, posterior tibialis and dorsal ped is) for any loss of strength (amplitude) 
comparing bilaterally. Auscultation is helpful over the abdominal aorta and renal arteries 
listening for any bruits. If an aneurysm ruptures, it usually results in death. Laboratory 
testing is helpful for managing A AA. If the ESR is elevated it may indicate an 
inflammatory aneurysm. Elevated creatinine could indicate kidney disease, and low 
hemoglobin may indicate anemia because of blood loss. Certainly, if the chiropractic 
physician suspects and/or detects an AAA, spinal manipulation and/or physiotherapy is 
contraindicated and the patient should be referred immediately to a vascular specialist for 
further evaluation/consultation and/or surgical repair.  
 
 
 
 
X-RAY SCAN LUMBAR SPINE AND PELVIS (AP VIEWS):  
 
LUMBAR SPINE (AP VIEW) AND PELVIS (AP VIEW):  
Note: The x -ray scan for the AP lumbar spine and AP pelvis will be assessed together.  
Give it your first impression —normal versus abnormal, congenital (something the patient 
is born with) versus acquired (something the patient  develops over time, either short or 
long term).  
Assess the SI (sacroiliac joint) looking at the lower 1/3 of SI joint for any 
abnormal findings i.e.; fusion, sclerosis, erosion, widening and/or destruction. 
Consider the following possible causes:  
AS (ankylosing spondylitis) -symmetrical bilateral fusion of SI joint. Seen in 
males 15 -35 years old. Symptomatology is usually stiffness of axial skeleton. 
Blood work HLA - B27 is positive, ESR is increased, mild anemia is present 
and RA factor is negative.  
DJD (de generative joint disease aka osteoarthritis or wear and tear 
disease) - unilateral and/or bilateral asymmetrical sclerosis of the lower 1/3 
of the SI joint (seen on both the ilium and sacrum) and narrowing of joint 
space is common. Symptomatology is usually pain, stiffness, crepitus, 
swelling and deformity of joints. Blood work is negative.  
Osteitis condensi illi- bilateral symmetric sclerosis on the ilium not on the 
sacrum. Seen in women 20 -40 years old and multiparous. 
Symptomatology varies —patients may have loss of or excessive sacroiliac 
joint motion and possible referred pain into the lower extremity and groin. 
This condition is self -limiting. Blood work is negative.  
A. RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) -unilateral erosion of SI joint, no sclerosis; 
fusion is rare. Can be seen in males or females in the range of 20 -60 years 
old, but is more common at the age of 40- 50. Signs and symptoms vary. 
Patient may have a low -grade fever, fatigue, weight loss, muscle soreness 
and atrophy. Symmetric peripheral joint pain and swelling especially in 
the hands and feet. Laboratory findings reveal RA latex positive in 70% of 
the cases, elevated ESR and anemia.  
Psoriatic -bilateral asymmetric erosion of SI joints; fusion is rare. Seen in 
patients 20- 50 years old. Skin lesions are  common—dry, raised, red and 
silvery scaly patches. Changes of the nails is common in 80% of arthritis 
patients (pitting, ridging, discoloration, loss of the nail or a thickening of 
the skin under the nail tip). Lab findings reveal negative ESR unless the 
patient is in the acute phase, RA latex is negative, HLA -B27 is positive in 
75% of patients who have sacroiliac joint involvement and positive 30% 
of the time in patients who have peripheral joint involvement.  
Reiter's -unilateral erosion of SI joint more c ommon in the early stages; 
can be bilateral either symmetric and/or asymmetric and fusion is rare. 
Affects males more than females in a 50 to 1 ratio and usually seen 
 
 
between the ages of 18 -40. This arthritis tends to affect the lower 
extremities, primarily the foot. Laboratory findings reveal HLA -B27 
positive in 75% of the patients. Patients may also develop a triad 
following sexual intercourse (urethritis, conjunctivitis and polyarthritis).  
Enteropathic arthritis -bilateral fusion of SI joint (symmetric) u sually seen 
in young adults; findings almost identical to AS usually cause d by a 
gastrointestinal disease most common ulcerative colitis and regional 
enteritis (Crohn's disease). Laboratory findings will reveal a positive 
HLA -B27 in 10- 12% of the patients and RA factor is negative.  
Hyperparathyroidism- bilateral widening of SI joint (symmetric), females 
more affected 30 -50 years old. Patients have an increase in parathyroid 
activity, which causes an osteoclastic effect on the bone. Laboratory 
findings reveal  an elevated alkaline phosphatase and parathoromone.  
Infection -does not usually affect SI joints, but if it does it is unilateral and 
crosses the joint space and destroys the joint. Many times the first sign of 
an infection is soft tissue swelling i.e.; ed ema, obliteration and/or elevated 
fat planes and increased density changes in soft tissue. Most common 
cause is  Staphylococcus aureus . Laboratory findings may reveal elevated 
white blood cells and increase in the ESR, most likely indicating an 
infection. S ymptomatology can vary depending upon the age of the 
individual and stage of the infection. Fever and swelling are typical 
symptoms. If an infection is suspected, the patient should be referred for 
medical intervention (antibiotics). Prognosis is usually g ood if diagnosed 
early.  
Special Note:  When assessing the sacroiliac joint, keep in mind that the 
posterior sacroiliac joint is located medial and the anterior joint is located 
lateral. In addition, the sacroiliac joint in children usually appears ill-
defin ed and widened  
After assessing the sacroiliac joints, continue assessing the pelvis 
i.e.; ilium, sacrum, coccyx and hips. Look at the periosteum for any 
periosteal reactions, cortex for any fractures, thickening or thinning 
of cortex and medullary portion of the bone (trabeculation) for any 
coarsened or thinning trabecular patterns and any increased and/or 
decreased densities. If there is increased trabecular pattern with 
thickening of the cortex, consider Paget's disease. If there is 
decreased trabecular p attern with thinning of the cortex, consider 
possible osteoporosis. In cases of increased density, consider 
possible blastic reaction like Paget's or blastic metastasis. In cases of 
decreased density, consider possible lytic reaction like a lytic 
metastasi s, Multiple Myleoma or osteomyelitis (infection).  
Note:  Whenever possible, always compare structures bilaterally looking for any 
differences from side to side, which may indicate pathology. Always consider the 
patient's history and past medical history, pa ying specific attention to any recent or 
 
 
old trauma/falls. In addition, consider the patient's family history, age and sex, 
which  may help rule in or out many osseous disorders  
Assess the acetabulum i.e.: acetabular rim, inferior acetabular fossa (aka Kohl er's 
teardrop) and femoral head, neck, and greater and lesser trochanter. When assessing the 
hips, look at the acetabulum, femoral head and neck for the following:  
Protrusio Acetabuli - protrusion of the head of the femur into the medial 
aspect of the acetabulum usually associated with the following:  
RA (Rheumatoid arthritis) -most common cause, usually seen 
bilaterally with uniform loss of the joint space. When seen 
bilaterally, it is referred to as  Otto's pelvis . 
Trauma- cause acetabular fracture seen unilat eral 
Arthritis -most often from RA. When caused by DJD, it is 
usually unilateral with nonuniform loss of the joint space, 
osteophytic formation at the outer supraacetabular margin 
and lateral and inferomedial surfaces of the femoral head. 
Subchondral bone cysts are usually present. Buttressing 
/thickening of the cortex is possible at the medial aspect 
of the femoral neck and joint deformity or flattening of 
the femoral head at its superior aspect.  
Fractures of the proximal femur- (classified  as 
Intracapsular and Extracapsular)  Intracapsular -are 
considered fractures inside the joint capsule and consist 
of the following:  
Subcapital - most common . Two types -impacted or 
displaced. When considering the possibility of a 
subcapital (impacted) fracture, one should look closely 
because they are difficult to detect especially if there is 
no displacement.  
Midcervical -uncommon 
Basicervical -uncommon 
 
Note:  Nonunion and avascular necrosis are complications 
that can arise with intra -capsular fractures:  
Extracapsular -are considered fractures outside the joint capsule and consist of the 
following: 
• Intertrochanteric- usually seen between the greater and lesser tro chanter; could 
be right through both the greater and lesser trochanter, giving rise to two 
fragments.  
 
 
• Trochanteric- greater trochanter fractures usually caused by a fall and are seen 
in elderly patients whereas lesser trochanter fractures are usually seen i n 
children or adolescent athletes. Lesser trochanteric fractures when seen in 
adults are usually caused from a pathology like a secondary metastatic lesion.  
• Subtrochanteric- usually associated with pathologic diseases like Paget's and 
metastatic lesions in the proximal femur.  
Note: As a general rule, proximal femoral fractures are not that common in 
young and middle -aged patients as compared to geriatric patients. The risk of 
developing a proximal femoral fracture increases with age. There are certain 
conditi ons that also increase the likelihood of a proximal femoral fracture i.e.; 
Paget's disease, fibrous dysplasia, malignant/benign bone tumors, osteoporosis, 
osteomalacia, osteonecrosis radiation -induced etc. There is also a high incident 
of death because of proximal femoral fractures in geriatric patients because of 
pulmonary and/or cardiac complications.  
Dislocation of hip -two types  
 Anterior- less common than posterior dislocation, femoral head is 
usually dislocated inferior, medial to the acetabulum because of a 
force from abduction and extension of the femur.  
 Posterior- most common type, femoral head is usually 
dislocated completely out of the acetabulum. Cause 
usually from severe trauma hip is in a flexed and 
abducted position i.e.; motor vehicle accident (M VA).  
Note:  Complications of a hip dislocation can be 
degenerative arthritis, myositis ossificans, avascular 
necrosis and sciatic paralysis.  
Legg Calve's Perthe's (aka Avascular Necrosis) -femoral capital epiphysis develops 
necrosis before closure of the growth plate.   Early detection of the disease is 
accomplished by performing plain film x- rays as well as MRI to help evaluate the 
articular cartilage. Radioigraphically, the joint space at the medial aspect of the hip tends 
to be increased, and the femoral head is displaced laterally known as Waldenstrom's sign. 
Femoral head may appear small and there may be a lucency noted at the femoral head, 
which  is known as crescent sign (aka rim sign).  There also may be sclerosis of the 
epiphysis which is known as snowcap appearance.  
Later in the disease, deformity can occur causing the femoral neck 
to be short and the femoral head enlarged which is known as coxa 
magna or the femoral head to be fattened known as coax plana or 
mushroom deformity. The disease is considered self -limiting within 
2-8 years. The problem with Legg Calve's Perthe's disease is 
development of deformity. This disease affects those between the 
ages of 3 and 12. Males are affected mo re than females in a 5 to1 
ratio. Patient may complain of groin pain and present with a limp. In 
long standing Legg Calve's Perthe's disease, the patient may develop 
degenerative arthritic changes of the hip, painful and decreased 
 
 
ROM, possible muscle atro phy and a short leg. The patient may also 
complain of stiffness which improves upon walking. Prognosis of 
the disease has to do with age, sex, radiographic findings and time 
of diagnosis. Treatment (if found early) is usually surgery to prevent 
lateral dis placement of the hip and encourage healing of the 
cartilage and femoral head. If found later in the disease, hip 
replacement is possible.t.  
Slipped Femoral Capital Epiphysis -considered the most common hip disorder of the 
adolescent . Femoral head remains in  the acetabulum while the femoral neck slips 
superior on the femoral head. Radiographically, there may be widening of the growth 
plate, reduction in the epiphyseal height, medial periosteal buttressing at the femoral neck 
and abnormal Klein's line. Klein's  line is a line drawn on the AP pelvis/hip view at the 
superior lateral aspect of the femoral neck. The lateral aspect of the femoral head 
(epiphysis) is evaluated to see if it passes through the line. If the epiphysis lies medial to 
the line, it indicates  an abnormal finding and strongly indicates slipped femoral capital 
epiphysis. This disorder affects males more than females, blacks more than whites, and 
individuals 10- 15 years old. The condition tends to be unilateral more than bilateral. The 
classic pr esentation is seen in an obese adolescent with a limp who has hip pain which 
may radiate into the knee. If the slippage is severe, the patient usually has a positive 
Trendelenburgs test indicating a weak gluteus medius. If seen bilateral, the patient may 
present with a waddling gait. Radiographic evaluation should always include an AP 
pelvis/hip and frog- leg projection. There are complications of slipped femoral capital 
epiphysis if left untreated i.e.; coxa vara deformity, abnormal development of the femor al 
neck, possible avascular deformity and the most common complication—degenerative 
joint disease. Treatment usually consists of surgical repair with pins to prevent further 
slippage. 
Note:  Shenton's line may also be used to assess for the possibility of 
slipped femoral capital epiphysis, hip dislocation or femoral neck 
fracture. A smooth curved line is drawn from the inferior portion of 
the femoral neck to the superior pubic ramus (superior border of the 
obturator foramen) a break in the line would indicat e a positive 
finding. 
Congenital Hip Dysplasia- deformity of the acetabulum resulting in dislocation of the 
femur from the deformed acetabulum. Radiographically, there is an absent or small 
proximal femoral epiphysis. There is displacement laterally of the femur and a shallow 
acetabular roof. If all three radiographic findings are present, it is known as Putti's triad.  
 
Note:  In addition, always assess any part of the shaft of the femur 
that is visible, looking for any periosteal reactions, fractures of the 
cortex, thickening or thinning of cortex, medullary portion of the 
bone (trabeculation) for any coarsened or thinning trabecular 
patterns and any increased and/or decreased densities (aka 
lucency/opacities) as well as any deformities  
 
 
After assessing the pe lvis/hips continue assessing L5- S1 region 
(lumbosacral spine) looking for the following:  
Transitional vertebra - Two types  
A. Sacralization -is when L5 takes on the characteristics of the sacrum  
B. Lumbarization - when S1 takes on the characteristics of the lumbar 
spine 
Note:  Transitional vertebrae are not always completely developed, 
but can be partially developed either bilateral or unilateral and can 
form accessory joints between the lumbosacral junction (what is 
referred to as a false joint or pseudo joint). In addition, a 
transitional vertebra, which causes a scoliosis and the patient to 
experience sciatica, is referred to as  Bertolotti's syndrome . 
Facet tropism —asymmetrical facets located in different planes, usually 
one in the sagittal plane and one in the coronal plane. The most common 
area affected is the lumboscaral spine. The clinical significance of this 
finding is debatable as to whether or not it causes lower back pain.  
Spina bifida occulta —normal variant. This is failure of the fusion of the 
lamina to f orm the spinous process. No clinical significance.  
Knife Clasp syndrome —a normal variant located at L5 -S1. The L5 
spinous process is enlarged and elongated pointing in the caudad direction 
and S1 reveals a spina bifida occulta. This syndrome is usually pai nful 
upon extension manuevers. Conservative treatment should be focused on 
avoiding extension maneuvers and not contacting the L5 spinous process. 
The patient should be encouraged to do flexion type exercises to help 
strengthen, tone and stretch the muscul ature, ligaments and fascia over the 
lumbosacral spine. If conservative care is not successful, surgical removal 
of the elongated spinous process is an option.  
Spondylolysis and/or Spondylolisthesis -look for a pars interarticulars 
defect, usually a linear oblique lucency located inferior to the pedicles. In 
addition, assess for an inverted Napoleon's Hat sign seen with a grade 3 or 
more spondylolisthesis and the appearance of bowline of Brailsford as 
discussed previously in part nine of this course under "S pondylolisthesis 
Clinical and Radiographic Significance."  
Assess all bony structures of the lumbar spine i.e.; vertebrae, 
pedicles, lamina, spinous processes, superior and inferior facets (aka 
zygoapophysis) and TVP's. Evaluate for any abnormalities and/or  
congenital anomalies, scoliosis, vertebral compression fractures and 
fractures in general. Also, assess any missing pedicles, hypertrophy 
of pedicles (as previously mentioned in part seven of this course 
under "AP Thoracic View") and assess any failure of  fusion of 
lamina, spina bifida occulta as previously mentioned in part eight of 
this course under "AP Thoracic Spine."  In addition, look for any 
 
 
lumbar ribs or hypoplastic ribs of the lower thoracic spine and 
costochondral cartilage calcification.  
Assess all soft tissue structures looking for any calcification, enlargement 
and/or displacement i.e.;  
A. Calcification and/or dilatation of abdominal aorta -usually located on 
the left side of the spine  
B. Calcification of common iliac -usually located over the s acrum 
region 
C. Calcified lymph nodes i.e.; peripheral mesenteric lymph nodes often 
seen after a previous infection and are the most common abdominal 
lymph nodes to calcify  
D. Calcified thrombus within a vein known as phleboliths considered 
the most common calcification in the pelvis, usually multiple and 
bilateral, asymptomatic and of no clinical significance  
E. Calcification of uterine fibroids -seen in females in pelvic basin  
F. Calcification of ovarian tumors which can be seen in benign and 
malignant tumors of the o varies  
G. Calcification of the prostate -seen in males usually over the age of 40 
caused from renal calculi or prostatitis and seen lying over the pubic 
area 
H. Calcification of the vas deferens -seen in long standing diabetes and 
usually found in men located over  the superior aspect of the pubic 
rami 
I. Calcification in the gluteal region -usually from injection sites in the 
subcutaneous and intramuscular area  
Note:  Many of these calcifications are benign in nature, but if there 
is any clinical concern, additional diagnostic testing should be 
performed to rule out the possibilities of any pathology. In addition, 
all gas shadows (lucency) should be fully evaluated espe cially when 
overlying areas of bone in order to rule out the possibility of an 
osteolytic/metastatic disease.
